    "article_text":"At the end of Q2 2019, e-commerce represented 10.8% of U.S. retail spend. In Q2 2020, amid the height of pandemic lockdowns, e-commerce spending surged 44.5% \u2014 its biggest quarterly growth in 20 years. The surge has been driven not just by Americans staying at home but also retailers ramping up their BOPIS options (buy online, pick up in store). BOPIS encompasses curbside pickup and also \u201cship from store,\u201d a relatively new option that gets items to you faster by shipping from your nearest store rather than from a warehouse. Amid the pandemic, many stores that were closed to in-person shoppers still had employees inside, packaging and shipping orders from the store. Dick\u2019s launched curbside pickup early in the pandemic and said 75% of its online orders in Q2 were fulfilled by stores (shipped to the customer from their nearest store, or picked up curbside). In Q3, even after Dick\u2019s reopened stores, curbside kept growing. \u201cWe anticipated originally that we would see a large drop-off when the stores reopened, but that is not the case,\u201d Dick\u2019s president Lauren Hobart noted on the company\u2019s Q2 earnings call. (Hobart will be the next CEO of Dick\u2019s, effective Feb. 1, the company announced this week.) Dick\u2019s CEO Ed Stack added: \u201cIt started off as a safety piece... It's now becoming a convenience piece.\u201d Moving forward, a more muted Black Friday could become the norm. Mastercard\u2019s latest SpendingPulse survey, Sadove added, found that \u201cthe consumer wants product anywhere, any time that they can get it... Now they know how to do curbside pickup, they\u2019re going to continue to want that.\u201d But Sadove also cautions that brick-and-mortar shopping is hardly dead, given that 80% of spending still occurs in a physical store. \u201cWe can\u2019t look at this as being online-only \u2014 it\u2019s omnichannel,\u201d Sadove said. \u201cYou have to be able to do buy online, pick up in store. None of that\u2019s going to go away. Having said that, as soon as we feel comfortable with the vaccines, you\u2019re going to see people going back into stores. The DTC [direct-to-consumer] brands will open up more stores because of the interplay between people wanting to shop online and in a physical store. All of these trends are going to be accelerated. The winners that were winning beforehand and the losers that were losing, that trend is going to continue, and be accelerated.\u201d \u2014 Read more:"

    "article_text":"  Amazon workers around the world are protesting about their working conditions, including through strike actions,\u00a0 during one of the busiest periods of the year.  A global union initiative to hold the e-commerce giant to account planned action by workers and supporters in 15 countries around the world on Black Friday, including in the U.S., U.K., Germany, France, and India. The UNI Global Union said that workers and supporters would hold Amazon to account for alleged anti-union practices, worker safety issues, tax avoidance, and the company\u2019s environmental impact.\u00a0 Workers at seven of Amazon\u2019s 16 warehouses in Germany have been on strike since Thursday, and in some cases since the beginning of the night shift on Wednesday, protesting conditions and pay. The company employs 16,000 permanent front line employees and brought in an additional 10,000 to boost capacity during the busy holiday period. Verdi told MarketWatch that around 2,500 workers or more were taking part in the strike, which is in line with the participation numbers from actions the union organized in October and June. According to Amazon, the participation is far lower by as much as 1,000 workers. Verdi and Amazon have been at loggerheads for seven years over Amazon\u2019s rejection of collective bargaining agreements for workers in the retail and mail-order industry.  The union representing 2 million workers says that Amazon\u2019s German workforce suffers lower wages and poorer working conditions because they are not included in the collective agreement. Amazon said that the strikes in Germany were having \u201cno impact\u201d on their regular activities, and reiterated their position that the company offers excellent pay, benefits, and opportunities for career growth, as well as a safe work environment. The strikes come a day after Amazon announced that it would be rewarding its front line workers with a one-time bonus costing the company $500 million."

    "article_text":"\n Truist Securities analyst Youssef Squali estimates that Amazon will grab 42% in U.S. e-commerce spending this holiday season. That share, measured in gross merchandise value, is up from 36% last year. \"We're incrementally positive on AMZN going into what should be a blockbuster holiday season, given the company's outsized growth within U.S. e-commerce,\" Squali said in a note to clients Wednesday. Squali believes Amazon will grow its e-commerce sales in North America by 42% year over year in the fourth quarter. The Covid-19 pandemic is behind much of the growth, Squali said. The health crisis \"has forced consumers online and away from brick-and-mortar stores, where high density of traffic fuels the transfer of the virus,\" he said. \"In fact, if the current spike in Covid-19 cases continues, and store capacity is further restricted, we believe it would force even more people to order online.\" Amazon also is benefiting from near-record retail store closings this year, Squali said. Year to date, there have been 8,325 announced store closures in the U.S. In 2019, the industry saw a record 9,300 store closures, he said. Amazon stock is the \"best way to play\" online holiday shopping trends, he said.

    "article_text":"\n Investors are finding fewer stocks to buy, but also huge gains when they pick the winners that survive and thrive. (\u00a9 Dave Cutler) The value of publicly traded companies is skyrocketing, rising 13% or nearly $5 trillion just this year alone, says Wilshire Associates. And since the March 9, 2009, low, investors have made $37 trillion. But it's not just one or two down years. The decline in stocks to buy is even more head-turning the further you look back. The number of Wilshire 5000 stocks is down 7% in five years and a breathtaking 50% in 20 years. It's almost staggering to see how much smaller the stock market has gotten over time. During the mid-1990s, investors had more than 7,000 listed publicly traded companies to choose from, says research from Vanguard. The number of companies listed in U.S. markets peaked in 1996, says Davis citing data from the World Bank. And it's been \"in almost continuous decline since then,\" he said. Pinpointing exactly why so many companies are going away is hard. There's no single reason. But analysts and researchers point to several factors, including: Even those numbers pale next to historic levels. In 1996, 677 companies went public, a record, says Jay Ritter, professor of finance at the University of Florida. And nearly 500 companies went public in 1995 and 474 did in 1997. The IPO spigot is slow versus where it was. During the 2010s, 1,174 companies went public. That was down from the 1,299 that went public during the 2000s. Companies benefit from being large, especially in technology. The so-called \"network effect\" means the more people who use your products and services, the more valuable those products and services are to additional users. In this world, the winners take most. So rather than going alone and taking on giants, many companies that would have gone public in the past might simply sell to a larger one. \"In many industries, being big is more important than it used to be, so we have seen a lot of mergers over the past few decades,\" Ritter said. \"A lot of the consolidation has already occurred. But we still see most successful VC-backed startups selling out in a trade sale rather than going public.\" Just this year, Amazon bought five small companies. Microsoft has bought nearly twice that many. Smaller public traded companies often just fall through the cracks. Many lack any sort of research support from Wall Street. What's more, the key reason to go public, raising money, isn't as critical. Companies don't need as much capital as they used to,\u00a0Davis says. As the economy digitizes, new companies' need for capital is a fraction of what it was. Manufacturing is outsourced. Even computer capability is rented. Many companies find they can scale up quickly with a relatively small amount of human and financial capital. Davis points to TikTok, the international social media sensation with hundreds of millions of users. It stays private as it doesn't need much money, he says. Meanwhile, pools of private money are vast, allowing companies to get money they need without the hassle of being public. Facebook didn't go public because it needed money, Davis says. It did so mainly to give employee-shareholders a way to sell after it already grew into a behemoth, as it often the case with tech companies. And this is a good market. The market's rolls contract even more when the IPO market is less hospitable. Just 105 companies went public in 2016, the lightest year for new IPOs in the past 10 years. And that year, the Wilshire 5000 shriveled by 160 stocks. Most of the decline in the number of public companies is due to vanishing microcap companies, Vanguard found. And in times of economic stress, even more companies might slip. During 2001, after the tech-stock bubble, the number of Wilshire 5000 companies dropped by 583, the most on record. The financial crisis also exacerbated the trend; in 2009, the number of companies fell by 470. What's the upshot of this stock market trend? Does it matter if there are fewer publicly traded stocks to buy? Opinions vary. Losing microcap publicly traded companies is practically meaningless, Vanguard found.\u00a0 \"The investable U.S. equity market \u2014 the large-, mid-, and small-cap stocks that reflect investors' investable opportunity set \u2014 has remained a relatively constant proportion of the total U.S. equity market, and it has also maintained a consistent level of concentration among its constituents,\" Vanguard said in its report. What about venture capital partnerships that do buy many smaller promising companies? Those are usually off-limits to ordinary investors. But Ritter says investors aren't missing much. The returns are no better or no worse than publicly traded companies. \"The returns that limited partners have earned since 2006 have not been much different than publicly traded stocks have delivered, partly because of the big fees that the general partners take,\" he said. And publicly traded stock is worth about $30 trillion. That far exceeds the $4 trillion worth of equity owned by venture capital and buyout funds. Plus, investors own some of these private firms secondhand anyway. \"Most of the private equity investors are pension funds and endowments, so individuals indirectly have exposure,\" Ritter said. \"Millennials are coming to the Internet for (stock) information,\" Holmes said. \"Small companies will get a bid.\" The number of daily average trades at Charles Schwab, the largest online brokerage, doubled in the September quarter to 1.5 million. In all of 2020, a year of a pandemic and stock market meltdown followed by a sharp new upturn, daily average trades at Schwab surged 109% to 1.5 million. Nearly 200 companies went public this year using the SPAC method, Renaissance says. That's more than any individual type of IPO. And don't rule out the debut of more publicly traded companies, many attracted by the rich valuations some other IPOs are getting. The Renaissance IPO ETF, which tracks the value of IPOs, is up more than 85% this year. That tops the gains of all the major stock market indexes. Entrepreneurs are noticing. More than 240 companies filed to go public this year. That's up more than 20% from 2019. And the IPO filings include some hotly anticipated stocks like food delivery company DoorDash and home-sharing service Airbnb, Still, the same stock market trend continues, and downward pressure is constant and relentless. In the past eight years, 40% of operating companies that went public are biotech companies. \"There are a lot of listed biotech startups that will either go out of business or get acquired,\" Ritter said. \"There is no reason to expect much growth in the number of public firms,\" Stulz said. \"The most likely outcome is that the number will keep falling at a slow pace with some years that are exceptions.\" The number of stocks in the Wilshire 5000 is shrinking Sources: Wilshire Associates based on Wilshire 5000 Index YOU MAY ALSO LIKE: \n11\/27\/2020\nCheck the Stock Market Today column to spot changes in market trend and track the best stocks to buy and...  \n11\/27\/2020\nCheck the Stock Market Today column to spot changes in...

    "article_text":"Scrooge McPandemic is rearing his ugly head in the early onset of the crucial Black Friday shopping period. Online sales for Thanksgiving Day hit a new record with consumers spending $5.1 billion, an increase of 21.5% from a year ago according to new data from Adobe Analytics. But, the results came up far short versus Adobe\u2019s prior estimate of $6 billion. \u201cWhile yesterday was a record-breaking Thanksgiving Day with over $5 billion spent online, it didn\u2019t come with the kind of aggressive growth rate we\u2019ve seen with the start of the pandemic. Heavy discounts and aggressive promotions starting in early November succeeded at getting consumers to open their wallets earlier. While COVID-19, the elections and uncertainty around stimulus packages impacted consumer shopping behaviors and made this an unprecedented year in e-commerce, many consumers are still holding off on remaining gift purchases until today and Cyber Monday in hopes of scoring the best deals,\u201d said Taylor Schreiner, a director at Adobe Analytics. The ho-hum start to the peak of holiday shopping arrives as the economy weakens amidst the resurgent pandemic. U.S. consumer confidence tanked to 96.1 in November from 101.4 in October, according to the Conference Board on Tuesday. It marked the lowest headline reading since August (when stimulus was still around). The report highlighted sizable drops in consumer expectations for income, business and job market conditions. The Conference Board\u2019s read on consumers comes after an equally dismal reading from the University of Michigan. Consumer sentiment for the two weeks ended November 10 fell to 77 from 81.8 in October, also because a noticeable drop on expectations. Meanwhile, about 53% of 1,000 consumers recently polled by Goldman said they planned to spend less this holiday season. Roughly 23% said they would spend the same amount as last year. But dig beneath the headlines, and some of Goldman\u2019s pre-holiday learnings fall under the disturbing category. The survey showed 20% of consumers plan to spend \u201csubstantially\u201d less, while only 7% indicated they will spend more compared to 2019. By demographic, 62% of Baby Boomers surveyed said they would spend less, compared to 42% last year. \u201cOverall, we believe results point to soft holiday spending intentions this year vs. 2019, with a majority of consumers surveyed planning to spend less this year,\u201d Goldman retail analyst and the report\u2019s lead author Alexandra Walvis wrote.

And it is not hard to see what's at the heart of fund managers Patrick Kelly and Ankur Crawford's investment strategy. Their portfolio is, as its name indicates, focused, with only 48 stocks as of Sept. 29. Their top 10 holdings account for 53% of their shareholders' money. Kelly added, \"AWS has a $46 billion run rate, growing about 30% annually, with EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) margins over 30%.\" Run rate is annualization of Amazon's September quarterly revenue. Kelly said, \"Amazon also continues to invest in new business areas like groceries, one-day shipping, business-to-business commerce and geographic expansion in India and South America. And they are investing heavily in logistics.\" 5G is shorthand for the latest, fastest wireless communications networks. Qualcomm's near exclusive status as a maker of two kinds of chips lets it levy high royalty rates. Most of Qualcomm's profit comes from royalties handset makers pay to use the firm's cellular patents. \"The stock never expressed its full potential until this overhang was removed,\" Crawford said. \"Over the next two to three years, Qualcomm's growth will accelerate we think as they gain share as a large customer, Apple, grows in the 5G space. And they will take a majority share in chipsets in 5G handsets.\" If that growth does occur, it could make Qualcomm a bigger contributor to Focus Equity's bid to remain among the best mutual funds. Still, the Federal Trade Commission could appeal. Argentina-based MercadoLibre is an online retailer, auction site and payments facilitator. In addition, PayPal has become a lead generation service for consumers seeking financial services such as loans and insurance, Crawford says. In turn, each new service provides PayPal with information about customers, which it can then seek to monetize, Crawford says. Year to date going into Wednesday, the fund was on pace to repeat as an IBD Best Mutual Funds Award winner with a return of 40.93% vs. the S&P 500's 14.42%.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, more Americans have shifted to online shopping in order to avoid gatherings and maintain social distancing (read: 5 ETFs Deserving Special Thanks in Pandemic-Stricken 2020).Per Adobe, higher number of consumers will shop online on Black Friday this year. Online spending is expected to grow 39% year over year to $10.3 billion on the day. emarketer projects Black Friday to experience its first-ever $10.2 billion spending day, up 39.4% year over year. In fact, Cyber Five (Thanksgiving Day through Cyber Monday) would bring in about $39.1 billion ecommerce sales, up 39.6% from last year. About $6.2 billion is expected to come from Thanksgiving Day, $4.8 billion from Small Business Saturday, $5.1 billion will come from Sunday and $12.9 billion is expected to come on Cyber Monday.Black Friday online sales bonanza is in full swing as a number of retailers had already perked up their deals at the start of this month to lure customers. As such, Black Friday has turned into Cyber Month this year. We have highlighted some of the best deals from the retailers below: Amazon\u2019s AMZN 48-hour Prime Day shopping event unofficially kicked off the holiday season on Oct 13. The e-commerce giant launched its Black Friday sale on Nov 16. Like last year, Amazon\u2019s Black Friday sale will run for a week and will highlight many devices, gadgets, and other hot items from 2020. Some of the best deals include Echo Flex ($9.99, originally $24.99), 4th-Gen Echo Dot ($28.99, originally $49.99), Echo Show 8 ($64.99, originally $129.99) and Fire TV Recast ($179.99, originally $279.99).Wal-Mart WMT, the world's largest retailer, has split up Black Friday deals into three separate events throughout the month of November. The first and second events are already live and the third launched online on Nov 25 at 7 p.m. and in stores on Nov 27. The company is offering great prices on electronics, toys and gifts across apparel and home, as well as seasonal d\u00e9cor favorites. More deals will drop online on Nov 27 midnight, and then in store the following morning at 5 a.m. Some historically low-price products include AirPods Pro at $169, Apple Watch Series 3 starting at $119, Nintendo Switch Mario Kart bundle at $299. Instant Pot Viva multicooker at $49, Samsung 65-inch 4K UHD Smart TV at $478 and some more exciting deals available at Walmart (read: Solid Q3 Earnings Drive Retail ETFs Higher).Black Friday sales are also live on Target TGT, Best Buy BBY and Home Depot HD. Target has slashed prices on everything from headphones to video games to robot vacuums. Plus, the retailer is offering a price adjustment if a customer purchases any product that's labeled \"Black Friday Deal\" and the price goes lower than what they paid before Dec 24.Best Buy is offering epic discounts with some of the hot deals including 50-inch 4K TV Smart TV on sale for $229.99, a massive $500 discount on the HP Spectre x360 2-in-1 laptop, all-new Fire TV Stick Lite down to a record-low price of $17.99, a $200 price cut on the best-selling iRobot Roomba Robot Vacuum and Bella Pro Series air fryer on sale for just $29.99.

Macy\u2019s M began its Black Friday sales immediately after Halloween. All these attractive offers would boost retail sales and lead to a surge in stock prices in the days to follow. While an individual stock is certainly a great option to tap the Black Friday deals in the investment world, a basket approach through ETFs is diversified and more cost effective at lower risk. Below we have highlighted retail ETFs that investors should stock up this weekend.Amplify Online Retail ETF IBUYThis ETF has attracted $1.1 billion to its asset base and offers global exposure to companies that derive 70% or more revenues from online and virtual retail by tracking the EQM Online Retail Index.

Image source: Getty Images. The stock lost another 29% in September. By the end of the year, Jumia's share price was down to $6.\u00a0 \u00a0 The story in 2020 has been radically different. If you bought Jumia shares at the start of January, your investment is up by about 351%. Bottom-fishers have made out like bandits. Data source: YCharts. Why is Jumia's stock on a rampage this year? One possibility is that hedge funds and other traders are buying internet retailers across the board. After all, 2020 is the year of COVID-19. Internet companies in general have soared in this environment. Virtual retailers have seen sales spike dramatically. Yet in Jumia's case, this explanation doesn't make any sense. Regardless of how its broad sector is doing, the African e-tailer has gotten no sales tailwind from this lockdown environment. In fact, its revenues are actually worse than they were a year ago. Q3 Revenue Growth (YOY) Data source: Yahoo Finance. I would venture to guess that market traders have been squeezing the shorts. Jumia has a high short interest. About 21% of the float is sold short. So, yes, traders and short-sellers have been manipulating Jumia's stock and trying to bag some short-term profits. This sort of thing is nothing new. A couple of decades ago, lots of financial experts warned us that Amazon was doomed. In 1999, Barron's magazine put up a headline: \"Amazon.bomb.\" At the time, Amazon's market cap was $19 billion. If you ignored the pessimism in that Barron's article and bought shares of Amazon despite their high valuation, you would have made 79 times your investment in 21 years. (Of course, you would also have had to hang on through some really scary drops, including at least one 90% fall).\u00a0 While short-term traders are causing extreme stock fluctuations in Jumia, Foolish investors try to look past such shenanigans and think ahead five years, 10 years, or even more. Will internet commerce be incredibly valuable in Africa? Yes, absolutely. Will Jumia be the company to dominate that market? That's the billion-dollar question. One notable thing Jumia is doing is copying the highly successful strategies of Sea Limited, an internet retailer that is seeing spectacular revenue growth in Southeast Asia. Instead of building out warehouses and carrying large amounts of inventory, Sea runs Shopee, a virtual marketplace that third-party sellers use to connect with customers. While that business model has its own set of difficulties (you have to be mindful of fraud from those third parties), this sort of collaborative model allows much faster growth. And, of course, it saves a company from having a lot of money tied up in inventory.\u00a0 In addition to its shift to third-party sales, the company started up Jumia Pay as an internet payments platform (a copy of SeaMoney), and it introduced Jumia Games in the third quarter. This, too, seems to be an attempt to mimic the success of Sea Limited. It's exceedingly unlikely that Jumia will create an amazing new video game that will sweep across Africa. The company has no gaming experience. That's not what it does. So it's collaborating with another company, Mondia, that is supplying the games. While this business model has clearly been a winner for Sea, investors should probably wait and see if Jumia can successfully replicate it in another part of the world. Keep an open mind and wait for dynamic revenue growth before you invest here.\u00a0 Stock Advisor launched in February of 2002. Returns as of 11\/28\/2020."

The coronavirus pandemic has changed the world. But it has also accelerated certain technological trends that investors should be tapped into. From automation to genomics, these advancements are here to stay and there are many growth stocks that are just getting started. Corinne Cardina: Hi, everybody. I am Corinne Cardina. I'm the Bureau Chief of Healthcare and Cannabis on fool.com. Before we get started, I'd like our viewers to know we're using a question and answer service called Slido. You can open that up in your browser. There's also an app. Our code is MFLive. You can submit questions, upvote other people's questions for the ones you want to see answered. I'm so excited to welcome Scott Helfstein, like I just said, Executive Director, Thematic Investing at ProShares. Hi, Scott, how are you? Scott Helfstein: Hey, Corinne. I'm well. How are you? Cardina: I'm good. Fools, for the next 30 minutes we are going to talk about ProShares' new ETF. It is called ANEW. I'm going to drop the ticker in the chat, and it tackles four transformational changes that are being accelerated by COVID-19. Scott, can you give us the highlights of what those four transformational changes are? Cardina: Absolutely. We're going to talk about all these different trends. We're going to dive into some of the specific stocks that the ETF holds within the category and chat about why these trends are likely to endure beyond the pandemic. Before we jump into all that though, we've had exciting vaccine news this morning. So I don't want to ignore that. I think my question for you is, was this ETF designed for this current new normal? How do you think these trends are going to endure once a large segment of the population does become vaccinated? Some of these things may not be exactly where they are today, how do you picture this on the longer time horizon? Cardina: Absolutely. I think we've gotten a taste of a lot of these things because of the circumstances, but something like telework, I've realized that my job can be done 100% remote. Something like telehealth, once you have been able to log onto a video and see your doctor from your couch, that may be something you're interested in doing even when there's not a pandemic just because you've experienced the convenience. I definitely see where you're going with that. \u00a0 Helfstein: Similarly across all these areas, another one is online retail and I imagine we'll want to jump into some of the names there, but we saw e-commerce as a percentage total retail sales go from 11%to 16%, and new numbers should be out at some point this week. But to give everybody context, it took 10 years to go from 5% to 11%. It took a decade to reach 11% penetration. Ten years. So for all the people who think that Amazon is taking over everything, all of e-commerce is still only 16% of the pie. That doesn't suggest to me that all of a sudden, it's going to go back to 11. There's a whole lot more that it's going to capture and so it's just going to expand, not recede. Cardina: Absolutely. All right. I have some questions for you about the ETF and how it was designed, and then we'll get into some of these juicy stock names. My first question is, how do you expect this ETF to behave? How might it compare to the broader market in terms of volatility? Helfstein: So when you look at the NASDAQ, for example, 85% of the NASDAQ weight is in technology, consumer discretionary, and communication services. Certainly, as we think about things like future of work, a lot of those elements play in similarly on the discretionary with the digital consumer. Nonetheless, when you add in food and you add in genomics and telehealth, that has a little bit more of a staples traditional defense quality to it. What we've done is we have weighted each of the four themes equally. Twice a year, we'll reconstitute to 25% per theme, and so we think that that's a way to balance. While I can't say I would expect it to be necessarily more or less volatile than a broad index, it has elements of diversification with 143 names currently in the basket, that is, I think a little bit more balanced is the right way to phrase it. Cardina: Absolutely. What type of investor might consider this kind of ETF? Would you say this is good for someone who's looking for growth, value, diversification? Any thoughts there? Helfstein: I think it first and foremost falls into the growth category. We really focused on areas where there is an increasing size of the pie, if you will. For example, if you're talking about something like industrial automation, U.S., Europe, China, and Japan will have, based on current worker utilization rates, 125 million shortfall of workers by 2040. If one robot can do the job of four workers, we need 31 million industrial and commercial robots, and there's three million in the world today. Those are the types of things that we're looking at, where the pie is expanding. First and foremost, investors focused on growth should think about this. Our overarching theme here is one of transformational change. For us, those are rapid, high in magnitude, and things that are very hard to reverse out of, turn back the clock. Really anybody looking for a growth sleeve and we think actually that this could fall into someone's core portfolio, within their equity sleeve as their growth alternative. Perhaps different than a Russell Growth Index that's a little bit more focused. Also people who take a core-satellite approach, this is a reasonable, dramatic satellite. Cardina: Great. Let's talk about time periods. At the Fool, we are really long-term investors. When we're looking at the shorter side of things, we're looking at three years to five years. What would you say is the ideal time period that an investor should aim to keep their money in this ETF to experience gains? Helfstein: We think about it the same way as you guys do when it comes to our thematic baskets. For us, when we say theme, there's really three things that we tend to focus on. One is technological innovation. The second is demographic shift. The third is changing consumer behavior. Really this captures all of it. What we've seen in the last 10 months is that so many of these changes have just been accelerated so much faster than anybody believed possible. We're seeing these changes play out in a way that was really unimaginable, and yet, it still doesn't stop the fact that these are three years, five years, seven years, 10 years, in some cases, multi-decade themes. Food revolution and sustainable food with two billion more people according to UN projections by 2050. There's 177,000 new mouths to feed every day for the next 30 years. That is not a short-term trend. That is something that we are going to be grappling with and we're going to need to bring innovation to bear, in order to handle those. For us, this is a very long-term investment. Cardina: Great, that's very helpful. Let's dive in to each of these four categories. I think we're going to start with the future of work. Cybersecurity and automation are two trends that I think are top of mind. What can you tell us about these and which stocks in the ETF especially encapsulate these two trends, cybersecurity and automation? Helfstein: Microsoft is a juggernaut. It's one that's hard for people to wrap their brain around, because it is so prominent. We work with the Office Suite, and Word, Excel, and our operating system. But they've taken a lot of their revenue into the cloud with subscription service. We see that cloud and productivity tools make up about two-thirds. It's really interesting that you talk about Microsoft and Adobe because they've actually announced a partnership a little while ago to take on customer relationship management. So CRM is a new segment, the two of them working in conjunction. By the way, Microsoft, as I think you were implying, also has a big gaming division with Xbox. As we think about virtualizing work, it's a little crazy to think about this. But what about the virtual reality coffee break? Or the virtual reality water cooler? There are some companies that are uniquely positioned to be able to facilitate a new and different remote working environment. Microsoft I think is one that investors should continue to pay attention to. Really important from a productivity standpoint, and Adobe as well. My 11-year-old wanted a subscription to Illustrator for his birthday this year. They are not just talking about PDFs, but they are important in secure document management. However, we've got Photoshop, we've got Illustrator, they also have an artificial intelligence product called Sensei, which actually helps people to do their graphic and document management. They're on the cutting edge of artificial intelligence and machine learning in the documents space as well. Helfstein: I suspect with time they will. But again, it's such a rapidly growing area. If we think about the revenue growth that Salesforce has experienced, and just the growth of the CRM sector, which quite frankly almost didn't exist in its modern form 10 years ago. Cardina: Yeah. Helfstein: Whether we talk about something like CRM or we talk about cloud, these are all new areas. We're just at the beginning of these transformations. I would argue that what makes these companies really interesting is, you need them when times are good, and you still need them when times are bad. That whole notion of, we're going to have a reopening trade, and all the things that didn't do well are going to come back. That doesn't prevent these companies from still doing well. These companies had earnings, well, Microsoft grew their revenues by 18%. It's a multibillion dollar company that still managed to get double-digit growth over the past year. Even if that slows, and even if we do return to the office, we're still going to be using Teams and our collaborative tools. We need customer relationship management services when the economy is bad, because then it's all that more important to deliver what your clients need in a timely and efficient fashion. I think investors are a little bit prone to think about reversion to the mean, and to say that things can't stay this good for some of these companies. I think that that misses the fact that so many of these businesses didn't exist a decade ago. Helfstein: You mentioned the importance of robots and while I'm not really a fan of not having a doctor in the room to operate on me, nonetheless, we have seen surgery, number of surgeries have come down during COVID. People are putting things off unless it is really a necessity. I think any ways we can deliver more efficient and safer healthcare outcomes is a pathway to the future and it's something that we should be excited about. When we think about something like surgical robots, there's a phenomenal barrier to entry there. You need to get people trained. They are expensive. It's not exactly the type of thing where a hospital is just going to hop off and go do something else. For a lot of reasons, we think that that's a growth opportunity. It speaks to remote, it speaks to artificial intelligence and automation, and so really encapsulates so much of what we're trying to talk about here. Helfstein: Well, I would pose a question that I think a lot of us don't think about, which is do we think it is easier to have a self-driving taxi operating in a downtown city or a self-driving tractor operating at a field? Cardina: Going with a tractor. Helfstein: As am I. Those are the types of things that investors should be thinking about, it's how all these technological innovations in one area are moving into another. When we think about, and by the way, why does the tractor only have to till the land? Why doesn't it have robotic arms in order to actually pick and store vegetables? So much of that is done by machine already and we're taking it to another level, for example, the use of drones; farmers using drones because a drone can evaluate things like oxygen level or chloroplast count in a way that walking through a field you would never see. If you have part of your crop that is getting sick or that is underdeveloped, you have a much higher likelihood of being able to use sensors from the sky. There is so much technology that is going to be brought to bear in food. Deere, for example, with something like the automated tractor will be a leading position. They already have the incumbency in terms of the relationships and they are investing to bring the technology to the customer. Cardina: I can say that I have definitely learned a lot from you today, Scott. I appreciate you sharing all these insights with us and we will keep in touch. Good luck with your new ETF and have a great afternoon. Helfstein: Thanks. You too, Corinne. Stock Advisor launched in February of 2002. Returns as of 11\/28\/2020."

The year leading up to the turn of the millennium was a big one for Plug Power. Two years after its founding in 1997 as a joint venture of DTE Energy Company and Mechanical Technology Incorporated, Plug Power hit the public markets and held its initial public offering on Oct. 29, 1999. Image source: Getty Images. In addition, Plug Power shipped its first fuel cell systems for stationary power applications. Now, more than 20 years later, Plug Power offers its fuel cell solutions for stationary power to a variety of industries, including data centers, railroads, telecoms, and utilities. According to its most recent count, Plug Power's GenSure stationary power solution can be found domestically in 3,000 locations in 46 states and abroad in 34 countries. Climbing more than 750% year to date, shares of Plug Power have been supercharged this year. That's not to say, however, that the stock's performance last year was anything short of impressive; shares ended 2019 155% higher than where they began. While the stock is now trading at about $27 -- a healthy increase over its 52-week low of $2.53 -- it's far short of the heights it has reached in the past. On its first day of trading, for example, shares of Plug Power ended the session at $160. And that's far from its high water mark. On March 10, 2000, shares of Plug Power closed at a whopping $1,498 per share -- and that was after hitting an intraday high of $1,510. Whether you're an Elon Musk fan or simply a renewable energy-savvy investor, odds are that when you hear the word \"gigafactory,\" the first thing to come to mind is the thought of Tesla announcing construction of another massive battery production facility. But Plug Power has its own gigafactory plans in the works. Image source: Getty Images. Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York is keen on Plug Power, which is headquartered in Albany, choosing the Empire State as the location for the gigafactory. Articulating his enthusiasm for the project, Sen. Schumer stated on his website, \"Plug Power is a great New York company, and I will do everything in my power to support Plug's expansion here in New York with the new job-creating gigafactory.\" Plug Power has made its hay by providing fuel cell solutions to the material handling equipment (think forklifts and such) market. However, the company has made progress in expanding into what it characterizes as the e-mobility market. In one of its more recent deals, Plug Power signed a memorandum of understanding for the demonstration of the company's ProGen fuel cell engine in Class 6 and Class 8 vehicles, which industrial gas company Linde will use for the delivery of products in early 2021. Yet the company has even loftier ambitions, setting its sights on the sky. In late September, Plug Power announced a partnership with Universal Hydrogen to explore hydrogen-powered flight. According to the company's press release, \"Under this partnership, the companies plan to develop, build, and certify a commercially viable hydrogen fuel cell-based propulsion system designed to power commercial regional aircraft.\" Plug Power estimates that its fuel-cell technology can be used by \"mid-sized regional turboprop aircraft\" to fly routes up to 1,000 kilometers. Selling major customers like Walmart and Amazon on the cost-effectiveness of its fuel cell solutions, Plug Power has excelled at growing its top line over the years. In 2019, for example, the company booked $230 million in revenue -- significantly more than the $19 million it reported in 2010. It's imperative to appreciate, though, that there's plenty of risk surrounding the stock. With a consistent record of failing to generate profits and strong cash flow, Plug Power should only entice the attention of the most risk-tolerant investors.

Preventing people from being bored is a surprisingly big business. PricewaterhouseCoopers estimates that consumers in the U.S. alone collectively spend on the order of $700 billion per year on everything from movies and television to video games, music, and books, which makes entertainment one of the country's biggest industries. Of course, whenever big bucks are at stake, big companies develop. A handful of familiar entertainment names have grown into outright behemoths, and they all continue to leverage their existing reach. Curiously, though, they operate distinctly different business models. Here's a rundown of the three biggest entertainment giants in the U.S., from smallest to largest. Image source: Getty Images. Market cap: $214 billion  Market cap: $226 billion  Comcast's big challenge in this ever-changing environment is finding the optimal mix of services and bundles with the widest appeal. Market cap: $256 billion  Finally, it comes as no real surprise that Walt Disney is the entertainment industry's single-biggest player, sporting a market cap in excess of $250 billion. What's most amazing about Disney's massive size is that it's still the biggest entertainment name, despite this year's overwhelming challenges. Coronavirus-related shutdowns and restrictions crimped the company's film and theme park operations far more than it boosted its streaming and television revenue. For its fiscal fourth quarter ending in early October, revenue was down 23% year over year, and lower to the tune of 6% for the full year. Full-year operating income was down nearly 50%, and off by more than 80% last quarter alone. Stock Advisor launched in February of 2002. Returns as of 11\/28\/2020."

    "headline":"Depression-Era Secrets of Retail Survival",
    "url":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/depression-era-secrets-retail-survival-120021542.html",
    "article_text":"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Since January, upward of more than 12,000 retailers in the U.S. have shuttered their doors \u2013 a record rate of decline. Yet shares in Macy\u2019s and its counterparts are surging in anticipation of the world after Covid-19, thanks to recent vaccine breakthroughs. How can smaller players get wiped out while the larger chains thrive? The bloodletting that\u2019s taking place right now is eerily reminiscent of what happened during the Great Depression. In the early 20th century, independent stores dominated retail storefronts in cities and towns across the nation. Most Americans bought everything from books to meats to gardening supplies from businesses owned and operated by folks who lived in the community. Such stores worked much differently than modern retail. Shoppers would enter the premises and ask a clerk for certain items. The idea of simply browsing the store? Unthinkable. That changed, though, with the advent of the first chain stores. These included general-merchandise stores like Woolworth\u2019s, which sold cheap factory-made goods, and the Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Company, better known as A&P. These and other early chains pioneered new methods of retailing that eventually became the norm. As historian Marc Levinson has shown, A&P began building stores that were the forerunners of today\u2019s supermarkets. A&P sold standardized packaged foods and built stores with predictable layouts; maintained lean inventories; and embraced the benefits that came with economies of scale. A&P bypassed wholesalers, buying directly from manufacturers \u2013 and in some cases, purchased food producers to secure further control over the supply chain. As these chain stores muscled into towns and cities, they began challenging the hold that small-time retailers had enjoyed. By the late 1920s, independents began pushing for special state taxes to slow them down. And then the Great Depression hit. By one estimate, retail sales fell 50% between 1929 and 1933. But this cataclysm did not hit the retail sector equally. A 1946 study mined census surveys and an obscure report from Commerce Department to create a data set on retailing during this critical period. In order to determine which variables were most predictive of a retailer\u2019s survival during the Great Depression, the researchers ran a series of regression analyses. They found that older retail establishments \u2013 ones that had already weathered previous, if smaller, storms \u2013 tended to survive the early 1930s at higher rates than newer establishments. Veteran establishments, after all, have a longer track record of success and more experience navigating challenges. These reputational assets allow them easier access to the kind of credit necessary to weather a severe crisis. (This dynamic also resurfaced in the Great Recession that followed 2008.) At the same time, though, a particular kind of well-established retailer was more likely than others to survive the Great Depression: chain stores. Several studies have confirmed this outcome. For example, an in-depth examination of grocery stores in Washington, DC, between 1929 and 1935 found that A&P and its peers had better chances of survival than independents \u2013 a remarkable outcome, given that many New Deal policies favored small-time retailers. Like older firms, chain stores enjoy economies of scale and purchasing power. They likewise had access to lines of credit that ordinary mom-and-pop businesses did not. There was another important factor. By one measure, stores with higher levels of labor productivity had a better shot at survival. But this wasn\u2019t just a matter of working employees harder. The 1946 study also found that retailers paying higher wages had greater odds of making it than those that cut labor costs. This is puzzling at first glance. In the struggle for survival that took hold of retailing in the 1930s, slashing wages was the easiest way to hold down costs. Many grocers opted for that strategy \u2013 and went under. By contrast, the most sophisticated chain stores \u2013 A&P in particular \u2013 did not, holding wages steady even though it temporarily hurt their bottom line. Those better-paid, experienced employees likely had more incentive and ability to help the company weather the storm. Fast forward 90 years, and past A&P\u2019s bankruptcy filing in 2015. Thanks to Covid-19, we\u2019re subjecting the nation\u2019s retailers to another extreme stress test with similar results. Independents, not large, well-capitalized chain stores, are taking a huge hit. And the firms accelerating changes in retail \u2013 Amazon, Target, Walmart \u2013 are strengthening while many smaller establishments go to the wall. At the same time, though, the established national retailers that have done the best in these trying times are the ones that, like A&P, have a reputation for logistics and high investments in human capital.(1)Target, which raised its starting minimum wage this summer, has seen record sales. So, too, has Costco, another massive retailer with a reputation for prioritizing employees. While it\u2019s too soon to know whether these trends will hold, there\u2019s a good chance that the pandemic may unleash a wave of creative destruction on retail the likes of which has not been seen since the 1930s. That may be overdue given the surfeit of retail space in this country. But this destruction won\u2019t be indiscriminate. If past patterns hold, some well-established but sophisticated national chains that put a premium on human capital are going to come out on top. The rest will be lucky to survive. (1) To be sure, companies have mostly avoided extending hazard pay to workers on the front lines of the pandemic, while also proceeding with stock buybacks.

    "headline":"Analysis: Battle of the billionaires - Bezos, Ambani gun for India retail supremacy",
    "url":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/analysis-battle-billionaires-bezos-ambani-113057050.html",
    "article_text":"By Abhirup Roy and Aditya Kalra MUMBAI\/NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Jeff Bezos and Mukesh Ambani, two of the world's richest men, face a turning point in a battle for preeminence in India's booming, nearly trillion-dollar retail market. The outcome of a legal dispute which has embroiled the billionaires' Amazon.com and Reliance Industries Ltd empires - where a court ruling is imminent - may shape India's retail landscape for years to come. The winner in the fight for Future Retail Ltd, Amazon's estranged local partner, will get pole position in the race to meet the daily needs of more than a billion people. Accusations of insider trading and contractual breaches, as well as nationalistic cries to keep the U.S. giant at bay, mark the high-stakes fight, which has snowballed from what began as a dispute between Amazon and Future. If Amazon succeeds, it may slow Reliance's plans to expand its e-commerce and brick-and-mortar operations. If Amazon loses, its hopes of expanding its interests in India's second-largest retailer and cashing in on its key grocery supply chain will be dashed, industry insiders say. Amazon is trying to stop Reliance's $3.4 billion purchase of Future Group's retail assets. The U.S. company, which won an injunction from an arbitrator to block the Reliance-Future deal, accuses its partner of breaching some pre-existing agreements, misleading the public and insider trading. Future denies the allegations. Amazon, Reliance and Future did not respond to requests for comment. Bezos's behemoth is a formidable foe, but Ambani has a history as a disrupter. He has shaken foreign telecom firms by offering dirt-cheap data. Industry executives see his e-commerce plans as a threat for Amazon and Walmart Inc's Flipkart. \"If Reliance moves faster and faster, obviously it'll become very difficult for anyone else to gain,\" said Himanshu Bajaj, head of consulting firm Kearney's India retail practice. Reliance, seeking to expand its JioMart e-commerce business, this month completed a $6.4 billion fund-raising by selling a stake in its retail arm to such investors as Silver Lake Partners and KKR & Co. GROCERIES, 'BIG BROTHER' IN AMERICA India's retail market will grow 46% over the next four years to an annual $1.3 trillion, reckons Forrester Research. The key battle is over groceries, expected to be worth around $740 billion a year by 2024. Founded by Kishore Biyani, dubbed India's retail king, Future transformed the country's retailing in recent decades, before COVID-19 hit the business so hard this year that Biyani was forced to find a new buyer. Around 1,300 of Future's more than 1,700 retail outlets in 400 cities sell groceries. Its budget supermarkets cater to middle-class shoppers, while its upmarket stores offer products like imported cheese and fresh guacamole, relatively rare in India's retail landscape. That makes Future a prized asset for both Reliance and Amazon. Reliance and Future dominate the market, with the next competitor, Avenue Supermarts Ltd's DMart, having just 220 outlets in around 70 cities. While Reliance boasts around 11,000 retail stores, just 800 of those offer food and groceries, UBS estimates. Future's retail assets would nearly triple Reliance's footprint in the grocery segment and boost its e-commerce plans, said Forrester analyst Satish Meena. Amazon sees Future as a long-term play to optimise its supply chain for grocery delivery, an area where it has lagged, Meena said. \"Grocery is the category in which you fight,\" he said, while losing Future to Reliance would \"slow Amazon\". Amazon, Future and Reliance this month hired some of India's top lawyers, who argued at length before a New Delhi judge. She is expected to decide soon whether to restrain Amazon from approaching regulators to block the Future-Reliance deal. Amid heated legal arguments and patriotic appeals, Future's lawyer attacked Amazon as \"Big Brother\" in America, arguing Future faces bankruptcy if the Reliance deal fails. \"Please don't allow this American giant to kill Future,\" the lawyer urged the judge.

Dividend stocks are like the comfort food of investing.\u00a0 They don't need to be particularly flashy, nor do they have to be the fastest-growing companies. They just need to be solid, reliable, and capable of generating steady growth. If they can deliver high yields, even better. Image source: Getty Images. Image source: Target. Earlier this year, Target raised its dividend by 3%, a modest hike, but that may have been more reflective of uncertainty around the pandemic than anything else. The company also recently said it would begin repurchasing shares again, a bullish sign for future dividend increases. Today, Target offers a modest dividend yield of 1.6%, which is slightly below the S&P 500's average of 1.7%, but the company makes up for it with its growth potential and reliability. Image source: Starbucks. Starbucks has been tested by the coronavirus pandemic, which has generally hammered restaurant stocks, especially those like the coffee chain that are largely dependent on commuters. However, the java giant looks poised to emerge from this crisis in a stronger position, as independent cafes have been hit especially hard, and those don't have the digital infrastructure, loyalty program, or balance sheet that Starbucks does. Additionally, the company has recovered from the pandemic faster than it expected to. Its comparable sales were down just 9% in its latest quarter.  As a dividend stock, the coffee chain has almost everything you could ask for: A dominant global brand; a business based on repeatable purchases of a timeless product; sizable profit margins; growth opportunities in China and elsewhere; and a history of innovation in technology and digital channels.\u00a0 The company has raised its quarterly payout every year since it first introduced a dividend in 2010, generally by a generous amount. Even during the pandemic, management boosted the dividend by nearly 10%. It currently offers a yield of 1.9%, but investors should expect that payout to grow steadily based on the company's track record and the fact that management is targeting long-term annual earnings-per-share growth of at least 10%. Additionally, sales are likely to boom when the pandemic ends. In fact, the company is targeting comparable sales growth in the 18% to 23% range for its fiscal 2021 (which began Sept. 28), despite the longer-range economic headwinds that this global crisis will leave in its wake. Image source: Getty Images. Marijuana stocks and dividends don't generally go together, but Innovative Industrial Properties is an exception. While most pot companies are unprofitable growers, IIP is a real estate investment trust, and in return for the advantages that corporate structure brings, it has to pay out at least 90% of its profits as dividends.\u00a0 The company is the leader in its niche, providing real estate to the marijuana industry. And by purchasing grow facilities and leasing them back to their previous owners, it provides those cannabis companies with access to capital as well. With a focus on clients that grow cannabis for the medical-use market, the company owned 63 properties across multiple states as of its most recent earnings report. Innovative Industrial Properties is growing quickly. It's revenue tripled year-over-year in its most recent quarter to $34.3 million, and as a landlord, generates stable cash flow, a rarity in an industry that operates at the whims of commodity pricing and heavy regulation.  Net income in its third quarter also tripled, reaching $19.2 million, showing its business generates excellent profit margins. The marijuana industry has been transformed in the last decade, starting with the legalization of recreational weed in Colorado and Washington in 2014. Four more states just voted to approve recreational cannabis use this month, bringing the total number that have done so to 15. President-elect Joe Biden has also called for the decriminalization of marijuana, which should add to the regulatory tailwinds for the industry. Innovative Industrial Properties has the opportunity to get into the potentially much-bigger recreational side of the business as laws change. The stock today offers a dividend that yields 3.1%, and its share price has doubled this year. As a unique dividend stock in a high-growth industry, Innovative Industrial Properties looks like an appealing choice for retirees and others looking for growth and income.

It might be tempting to think that record highs in major indexes like the Dow Jones Industrial Average mean it's a bad time to find bargains in the stock market. The truth is that there are always bargains, although you might have to dig a little to find them. There are always stocks that get left behind in a market rise because they are simply lumped together with other stocks in an out-of-favor group or because their particular business is facing a near-term challenge. Long-term investors can take advantage of these situations to pick up quality stocks on sale. Market sentiment will change, and well-run businesses with strong positions in their markets should overcome problems. Below are three stocks that I consider to be bargains. The first two are cheap by standard valuation benchmarks despite thriving businesses and are relatively safe bets. The third is a bit riskier but could pay off big time in the long run.

It recently began selling\u00a0selling contract development and manufacturing organization (CDMO) services that leverage its expertise in drug manufacturing. This new business may be its biggest growth driver in the future. The company has landed partnerships with Johnson & Johnson, AstraZeneca, Novavax, and Vaxart to manufacture those companies' COVID-19 vaccines. Emergent is also working on plasma-based COVID-19 treatments of its own using the approach it took for anthrax and smallpox medicines. It's the CDMO business that could just about double the company's revenue in the long term, however. CVS has been working for years to become more than a pill dispenser. The company's merger with Aetna created an integrated healthcare company, with health insurance and pharmacy benefit management businesses building on its retail locations. Pharmacy sales now amount to only 26% of the company's revenue. The company is also making its physical locations into medical clinics, offering valuable in-person services that can't be easily replicated online. The company administered 6 million COVID-19 tests in Q3 and is preparing to administer coronavirus vaccines when they come available. Additional store traffic for these services, along with seasonal flu vaccines, health screenings, diabetes management, and other clinical offerings, will bolster both pharmacy sales and front store purchases. CVS shares are down for the year along with other retail companies in the challenging environment, but the company still grew. Revenue for the first nine months of 2020 was up 3.5% and adjusted earnings per share grew a healthy 16%. Analysts expect the company to grow profit in the low single digits next year, but CVS has beaten analyst estimates for EPS 19 quarters in a row. The stock also pays a very safe 3% dividend yield. This core business isn't what captured investor attention this year. The company's technology proved adaptable enough that it could quickly develop two versions of COVID-19 tests that won authorization, one of which can be taken at home. Sales have been through the roof, essentially dwarfing the company's core business. Fulgent's stock soared this summer, but shares have lately been falling along with those of other testing stocks. Positive vaccine news has made investors look ahead to a decline in demand for coronavirus testing. The stock sells for 30% below its August peak. The market is correct that the company is getting a temporary windfall, but testing for the SARS-CoV-2 virus is going to be with us longer than some people think. The company has demonstrated how it can turn an opportunity into a commercial success in short order, greatly expanding its customer base in the process. Fulgent expects\u00a0revenue for the full year to come in 800% above 2019. I think Fulgent stock is a bargain for risk-tolerant investors who are patient enough to wait a few years. The shares sell for seven times estimates for EPS in 2021, and even though earnings may drop off for a while after that, the company is making piles of cash it can use to reinvest for growth in the business. The stock may continue to fall in the short term, so it could be wise to buy it a little now and add to the position if it gets even cheaper. Stock Advisor launched in February of 2002.

In August, Guardant Health's Guardant360 CDx became the first liquid biopsy test approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for comprehensive tumor mutation profiling across all solid cancers. Liquid biopsies are tests that analyze DNA fragments of tumors in the blood. Comprehensive tumor mutation profiling enables the identification of specific types of cancers, which can be used to determine the most effective treatment.\u00a0 Guardant Health is on track to generate revenue of close to $300 million this year. That's only a drop in the bucket compared to the $6 billion potential U.S. market that Guardant360 CDx targets.\u00a0 The market for Guardant360 also pales in comparison to the estimated total addressable U.S. market of more than $45 billion for Guardant Health's LUNAR liquid biopsy tests. The company is evaluating two tests in clinical studies: LUNAR-1 for cancer recurrence monitoring and adjuvant (secondary) cancer treatment and LUNAR-2 for early stage cancer detection. If these products are successful, Guardant Health will become a much bigger company over the next few years. The company offers arguably the best cloud-based database on the market. In October, MongoDB announced that its Atlas product is the first cloud database that enables customers to run applications simultaneously on all major cloud providers -- Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure. This could be a big draw for customers who want to leverage the strengths offered by each cloud provider. Organizations are flocking to the cloud. The COVID-19 pandemic has only accelerated this migration. At the end of 2019, MongoDB claimed more than 15,900 customers in over 100 countries. Its customer count now tops 20,200, with nearly 19,000 of them using Atlas.\u00a0 Despite its tremendous growth, MongoDB's market cap is still only around $15.5 billion. The company remains a much smaller player than the leaders in the database market. This relatively small size combined with an enormous market should give MongoDB plenty of room to run. This company is a textbook case of being in the right place at the right time. The Trade Desk markets the leading software platform for advertisers to buy digital ads.

The cost to Amazon will amount to about $500 million, logistics chief Dave Clark said in a corporate blog post. Like many of its peers in retail who had offered hazard pay as an incentive for workers to keep coming in during the pandemic, Amazon ended its bonuses after an economic upheaval swelled the ranks of job seekers. The company ended its $2-an-hour bump for hundreds of thousands of warehouse workers at the end of May. In June, it paid one-time bonuses of as much as $500. More recently, Amazon has faced criticism from some employees for trying to attract new hires with a $3,000 bonus to ensure sufficient staffing to cover the holiday rush while only offering existing workers vouchers toward Thanksgiving turkeys. Earlier this week, a union drive organized by a group of workers at an Alabama warehouse became public, a rare step at a company that has worked to fend off organized labor in its ranks. \u201cOur teams are doing amazing work serving customers\u2019 essential needs, while also helping to bring some much needed holiday cheer for socially-distanced families around the world,\u201d Clark said in the blog post Thursday. \u201cI\u2019ve never been more grateful for -- or proud of -- our teams.\u201d \u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P."

    "article_text":"Black Friday approaches! In a year where asking Alexa what day today is feels totally normal, this Black Friday seems like it came out of nowhere. As we say pretty much every year, a lot of Black Friday deals are \u2026 not that good. While there are certainly deals to be found, there's also a lot of hand-waving going on to help retailers and manufacturers clear out the old models and get that Q4 numbers boost. It can also be a day where it's way too easy to buy junk just because it's got a 40% off tag on it. With that in mind, we've tried to limit this list to the stuff we'd recommend even when it's not on sale. If we see anything else worthwhile over the next day or two, we'll add it \u2014 so feel free to check back in. This article contains links to affiliate partners where available. When you buy through these links, TechCrunch may earn an affiliate commission. A few tips to keep in mind today: Be at least a little wary of TV deals. There are TV deals to be had, for sure \u2014 but the most eye-popping deals tend to be surplus panels with a new model number slapped on them. Google the model number; if that specific TV seems to only exist for the sake of Black Friday, think twice. \u00a0 Image Credits: Brian Heater Once unheard of, Apple deals on Black Friday are now a little easier to find. They tend to go fast though! Image Credits: Amazon With people already flocking to Amazon on Black Friday, the company usually offers some pretty massive discounts on its Amazon-branded devices as a means of seizing the moment and getting more people into their ecosystem. Sure enough: Image Credits: Brian Heater Google tends to go pretty big with the Black Friday discounts, and this year is no exception. Some examples: Image Credits: Roku Image Credits: Sonos Image Credits: Hulu If you don't mind ads, Hulu is slashing the price of its ad-supported plan from $6 a month to $2 a month for 1 year. Sadly, no deal for the ad-free plan, which is still at its normal $12 a month \u2014 but if you were planning on checking out the ad-supported plan anyway, you might as well save a couple bucks. Image Credits: Calm You probably won't be finding any deals on this year's new Xboxes or Playstations because \u2026 well, they already couldn't keep up with demand. This year's best deals are going to be on games, services and, in a few cases, accessories. Hell, the same goes for the Nintendo Switch. Even without a new hardware release this season, Nintendo's console is flying off the shelves. If you're looking for big savings on a Switch itself this year, know that the inventory is incredibly low \u2014 any retailer offering a Switch deal is really just doing it to get your hopes up and get you on the site. We're having a hard time finding any in stock even at full price. Most retailers will also have sales on Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, Watch Dogs Legion and Star Wars Squadrons."

    "url":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/amazon-spends-500m-bonuses-christmas-195649982.html",
    "article_text":"Amazon is spending hundreds of millions of dollars on bonuses for Christmas staff after sales at the online giant soared during the pandemic. Full-time warehouse workers in the UK and the US will receive \u00a3300 or $300, with \u00a3150 or $150 for part-time staff. The money, $500m in total, will go to staff working between 1-31 December. The firm, run by Jeff Bezos, the world's richest man, praised staff for \"serving customers' essential needs\" during the pandemic. \"As we head into the peak of the holiday season, we want to share our appreciation through another special recognition bonus, totalling more than $500 million for our front-line employees.\" The firm has come under intense scrutiny for working practices in its warehouses during the coronavirus pandemic. They are calling for hazard pay, paid sick leave and better communication about outbreaks. Amazon workers have raised concerns about their health and working conditions in Europe as well as in the US, claiming it is almost impossible to practice social distancing. The company has previously said that its guidelines are adequate and that it provides employees with face masks. However, the company said in a statement that it \"provides some of the most advanced workplaces of their kind in the world, with industry-leading pay, processes and systems to ensure the wellbeing and safety of all employees\". Amazon said it had introduced additional cleaning and other safety measures to increase protection, and in the UK had started a pilot scheme offering voluntary Covid testing for employees. The retail giant has been one of the retail winners during coronavirus lockdowns as online deliveries skyrocketed when High Street shops closed. Sales will also be boosted during the Black Friday bonanza, although a coalition of trade unions, environmentalists and other activists have urged consumers to boycott the firm. Protests are being planned in several countries, and in Germany, the trade union Verdi has organised three-day strikes at Amazon warehouses, Sales at the internet giant shot to $96.1bn in the three months to 30 September - up 37% from the same period in 2019. And profits hit a record $6.3bn, nearly three times last year's total. But that level of growth has not come without additional costs. Amazon said it had $2.5bn in Covid-related expenses."

Enjoy! Our emails are made to shine in your inbox, with something fresh every morning, afternoon, and weekend. Africa reporter Back in 2012 when it first launched, Jumia\u2019s long-term goal was to become the leading e-commerce player on the continent. It set about that objective like typical e-commerce platforms do: acquiring vast inventory, building warehouses, and aiming to drive online sales based on the promise of ease and convenience. Indeed, one of the company\u2019s first steps was to hire account managers in charge of growing its inventory base across a diverse range of categories, from mobile phones and electronics to fashion, beauty and childcare. If customers wanted to buy it, Jumia\u2014often referred to as the Amazon of Africa\u2014wanted to be able to sell it. It was similar to the way Amazon itself started first with books and CDs and then eventually an Amazon of nearly everything. The first marker of Jumia\u2019s change in business model came in 2016 when its in-house inventory was whittled down and largely replaced with a vendor marketplace. Having invested in marketing and building its brand, Jumia began to essentially lease digital real estate by allowing independent vendors sell items on its website while earning commission from their sales. The tweak saw Jumia significantly reduce the underlying risk of holding inventory while democratizing its supply chain. The proposition also proved attractive to vendors who saw merit in tapping into Jumia\u2019s established e-commerce framework, from its online marketplace to its delivery and warehousing network. The changes to Jumia\u2019s business model have been borne out of painful lessons from its experiences as an e-commerce front-runner on the continent. One of its biggest early-day realizations was a trust deficit among customers which meant that selling the e-commerce dream was going to be tougher than expected. With customers\u2019 buying habits favoring offline retail over e-commerce and a preference for cash over digital payments, the company\u2019s first task, alongside its competitors, was to engineer a shift in user behavior. While JumiaPay will likely jostle for market share with an ever-growing pool of competing fintech players across the continent, the spin-off of its logistics arm could see it quickly become a market leader in various countries given how much of a problem logistics and last-mile delivery represent to many other small and large e-commerce players. With operations across 11 African countries, there are no other Africa-focused e-commerce players that can boast of Jumia\u2019s pan-African operational knowledge on the continent, making it an attractive option for smaller players looking to plug into its network Naturally, Jumia\u2019s move is far from being altruistic. And so, Jumia\u2019s decade-long evolution moves fully into its next phase. Originally positioned as a retail-focused, e-commerce behemoth, similar to Amazon\u2019s original positioning, Jumia has morphed into a B2B (business to business) facilitator of third-party e-commerce through its marketplace, payments service and logistics network. As Jumia losses begin to narrow, it\u2019s a path the company\u2019s leadership seem set on. With the business continuing to focus on vendor commissions and fulfillment revenues which now account for 70% of its marketplace income, first party revenue (i.e. revenue from merchandise bought and sold by Jumia) dropped by 53% year on year in the third quarter of 2020. \ud83d\udcec Kick off each morning with coffee and the Daily Brief (BYO coffee).

    "article_text":"(Bloomberg) -- Unions representing tens of thousands of Amazon.com Inc. employees are planning walkouts and other action as the year\u2019s busiest shopping season begins this week, in protest at the e-commerce giant\u2019s handling of everything from sick pay and Covid-19 precautions to user privacy.The giant Verdi trade union in Germany is holding a walkout across seven Amazon facilities, it said in a statement Thursday. It\u2019s part of the Make Amazon Pay campaign, an assemblage of organized labor, human rights organizations, environmentalists and other groups that are demanding changes at the Seattle-based company in a program of protests and online press conferences. Garment workers in Bangladesh will call for higher pay outside an Amazon supplier facility in Dhaka. In Australia, unions will perform \u201chealth and safety\u201d inspections of the company\u2019s facilities using their \u201cstatutory right of entry,\u201d the campaign said. Many workers\u2019 groups, blocked from picket lines and protests due to pandemic restrictions, have been driven online. Others will project the campaign\u2019s logo on buildings in Brussels, London, Sao Paulo and other cities. Amazon is working \u201cto make a positive impact as a progressive, innovative and sustainable business\u201d for customers, partners and employees, the company said in an emailed statement. \u201cOur jobs come with excellent pay, comprehensive benefits and great career opportunities, all in a positive, safe and modern working environment. We encourage anyone to compare our overall pay, benefits and workplace to other retailers and major employers across the world.\u201d In all, the organizations participating in the protests represent roughly 40,000 Amazon employees, according to a spokesman for the UNI Global Union, which represents millions of workers in industries including logistics and technology, and is helping organize the event. Unions, particularly in Germany, Spain and France, have for years used the Black Friday shopping holiday as a rallying point for action against Amazon. Such protests have done little to dent the company\u2019s dramatic growth. However, with criticism of its market power mounting, and the pandemic highlighting the plight of essential workers, some groups see a bigger opportunity this year to share their concerns. In France, where unions have fought a battle over Amazon workers\u2019 rights, the e-commerce giant has agreed to go along with other major retailers to postpone Black Friday. The move followed an outcry from smaller owners of physical stores who fear Amazon will take business from them during the country\u2019s virus lockdown. Politicians including Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo are calling for a boycott of the Seattle-based company for Christmas shopping.Make Amazon Pay -- which includes political, human rights and environmental groups such as Oxfam, Greenpeace and U.K. political movement Momentum -- presented Amazon with a list of demands including increased health-and-safety protections and worker representation, a lower carbon footprint at Amazon\u2019s delivery and cloud operations and an end to its sale of \u201cdevices and software that expand mass surveillance,\u201d such as the Ring camera and Rekognition facial-recognition service. \u201cDuring the Covid-19 pandemic, Amazon became a trillion dollar corporation,\u201d Make Amazon Pay said in the letter. \u201cMeanwhile, Amazon warehouse workers risked their lives as essential workers, and only briefly received an increase in pay.\u201dIn the U.S., the company\u2019s employees aren\u2019t represented by unions. Labor groups have tried to make inroads for years, without success. But that may be changing as Amazon\u2019s workforce swells to more than 1 million, making it one of the largest private employers. A group of Amazon workers in Alabama recently filed a petition to organize. Read More: Amazon Has a Europe Problem: Unions and Regulators Are Circling The company has a history of guarding against unions\u2019 influence. In September, it briefly posted a job listing for an analyst to research \u201clabor organizing threats against the company\u201d and to compile information that could be used to seek restraining orders against activists. An Amazon spokeswoman said at the time that the job posting was an inaccurate description of the role and had been corrected. Vice reported recently that Amazon has been using operatives from Pinkerton, a private security agency, to collect intelligence on warehouse workers and to monitor labor unions and environmental activists, citing leaked documents. An Amazon spokeswoman told Vice that the company has an internal investigations team that works within the law and denied that it had hired \u201con-the-ground operatives.\u201d An Amazon spokesman said Thursday that the company respects employees\u2019 right to join or form a labor union \u201cwithout fear of retaliation, intimidation or harassment.\u201d Read More: Amazon Merchants Say Deliveries of Some Products Are Delayed Still, Amazon\u2019s biggest problem this holiday season may be keeping up with demand.

In this Earnings Review that aired on Fool Live on Oct. 30, Fool.com contributors Danny Vena and Jason Hall discuss what caused the slower growth and why investors with a long-term time horizon shouldn't be concerned. Jason Hall: As of this moment in time, Amazon stock is down about 5.5%. Two of the biggest companies in the world, the stocks are tanking today. Danny Vena, talk to us. Danny Vena: When you look at the high level numbers, Amazon did really well. Net sales for the third quarter were up 37%\u00a0year-over-year. The company's net income per share essentially tripled. I don't think you could ask for much more than that. But if you look at it, I think the thing that investors are looking at is first quarter and second quarter, revenue grew 26% and 40%. So the 37%\u00a0is a little bit of a deceleration from the year-over-year growth that they gave in the first half of the year. But I think that also deserves context. You have to remember that Amazon Prime Day is typically held in July. This year, it was held in October. What you're having is the Prime Day revenue got shifted from the second quarter into the third quarter. I think that explains that. But again, Amazon is another stock that's had a huge run-up this year. If you look at it in that context, a little bit of a pullback is not necessarily a bad thing and I think that that company is going to have easier comps in the coming quarter with the move of Prime Day, and so I wouldn't worry about it. Jason Hall: It's a reminder that a stock price movement on a single day is probably best viewed as noise and investors always do better by focusing on the signal of what's materially happening with the business. I saw something on Twitter that somebody put that I thought was really interesting. The fact that Amazon has increased its employee headcount by basically double over the past year, and what somebody said on Twitter is \"Shortest investment thesis ever.\" You think about that and I think there's a lot to be said of that.

Black Friday is almost here, and it's shaping up to be a huge season for e-commerce. Verizon's Business Retail Trends Report found that online shopping traffic through the first week of November was up 82% compared to the same period this year, and top players in the space will likely see strong performance thanks to the momentum.  Image source: Getty Images. Everyone expects Amazon to do huge numbers through the remainder of the year as coronavirus-related concerns continue to shape the overall retail market, but performance may come in even better than anticipated. The e-commerce business will likely post stellar performance this holiday season -- and in the many holiday seasons to come. While the overall online retail market is growing fast enough to accommodate smaller, specialized platforms and big-box rivals making digital expansion plays, it's difficult to envision any competitor seriously disrupting Amazon. The company's massive data, technology, and infrastructure advantages make it perhaps the single safest stock in e-commerce -- a category that still offers huge room for long-term growth and strong investment returns.\u00a0 Target spent billions of dollars to remodel its stores and strengthen its omnichannel capabilities. By using its stores as fulfillment and distribution centers, Target was able to cut its shipping costs, and offer fast and convenient delivery options to its customers. It also paid $550 million to acquire same-day delivery platform Shipt in late 2017 as a means to further strengthen its distribution network.\u00a0 These moves have proved prescient. Target's e-commerce business is booming. Its digital comparable sales soared 155% in the third quarter. Surging online sales helped to drive a 21% increase in Target's overall revenue, to $22.6 billion, and a 45% jump in its earnings per share, to $2.01.\u00a0 Better still, it's now Target that's taking share from its rivals. The discount retail leader gained market share across all five of its core merchandise categories in the third quarter. In total, management estimates that Target has added over $6 billion in market share so far in 2020.\u00a0 These trends should continue well into the future as Target continues to wrestle away sales from retail competitors that have been unwilling or unable to invest in their e-commerce operations. With its online success fueling its growth, Target's shares have rallied 40% so far this year,\u00a0 and its stock appears set to reward investors with even more gain in the years ahead. This is where Pinterest can help. While it is technically an ad platform, 89% of people use the site to inspire purchases, according to the company. Pinterest pins will then link these customers to e-commerce sites. With 442 million monthly active users (MAUs), this can add up to a lot of sales. Moreover, history points to a bump in holiday activity. The fourth quarter of last year accounted for about 35% of Pinterest's yearly revenue. During this time, the company also increased its non-GAAP income by 55% from year-ago levels. Additionally, Pinterest ended last year with 335 million MAUs, an increase of more than 100 million in less than a year. This may help explain why the company projects a 60% year-over-year increase in revenue in Q4.\u00a0It may also point to a lot of pinning happening on Black Friday. \u00a0 Stock Advisor launched in February of 2002.

Your best bet is to choose index funds that give you broad exposure to domestic stocks, plus some international exposure if you want extra diversification. Here are three index funds that are perfect for IRA investors of any age.\u00a0 Source: ETF.com. Returns as of Nov. 20. This fund has an expense ratio of 0.03%, which means that just $0.30 of a $1,000 investment goes toward fees. It's even cheaper to own than the SPDR S&P 500 ETF, the standard-bearer S&P 500 fund, which has a 0.09% expense ratio. Image source: Getty Images. If you want to go beyond the bigwigs in the S&P 500 index, look to the Schwab U.S. Broad Market ETF. The fund tracks the Dow Jones U.S. Broad Stock Market Index, which means you'll automatically be investing in around 2,500 of the largest publicly traded companies in the U.S. With an expense ratio of just 0.03%, it's just as cheap to own as the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF. While a broad market index fund gives you a bit more diversification than an S&P 500 index fund, adding SCHB to your IRA won't give you much additional diversification if you already own S&P 500 funds. That's because there's so much overlap in the largest holdings. Like the S&P 500, the Dow Jones U.S. Broad Stock Market Index is cap-weighted, so the smaller stocks have a limited influence on the fund's performance. The top eight holdings for both this ETF and the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF are identical: Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Facebook, Alphabet Inc. Class A and Class C\u00a0shares, Berkshire Hathaway Class B shares, and Johnson & Johnson. For the Schwab fund, these top holdings account for just over 20% of the fund's assets; for Vanguard, they're just over 25%. Because both funds are dominated by the same stocks, you can expect pretty similar returns.\u00a0 More than 85% of the companies are based in developed economies, like Japan, Hong Kong, and the United Kingdom. While investing in primarily developed countries doesn't come with the big rewards of emerging markets, it's also far less volatile. Although the fund has consistently underperformed compared to the S&P 500 over the past 10 years, investing a small part of your IRA in this international stock ETF could be a good hedge if you want to diversify beyond U.S. stocks without too much risk.

There are undoubtedly some penny stock-trading success stories out there, but individual investors should generally avoid this area. In this regard, fractional shares are different from penny stocks. They don't have the same high-risk, high-reward profile that can propel astronomical returns, because they are bound by the same market dynamics as normal shares. That should be fine for the vast majority of individual investors. Amazon equity provides higher volatility and upside than the market, and you only need $1 to invest in it.

There's little doubt that this is a Thanksgiving Day like few others before it. With coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases hitting record highs in the U.S., many of us have forgone our traditional holiday gathering and chosen to fall asleep in a tryptophan-induced turkey coma on our couches while watching football. But even amid this chaos, we can be thankful that there's light at the end of the tunnel. Recent interim analyses in late-stage studies from Pfizer\/BioNTech\u00a0and Moderna showed respective vaccine effectiveness of 95% and 94.5%. While COVID-19 isn't going to disappear overnight, there looks to be a real solution on the horizon. Even when things are at their grimmest, there's always something to be thankful for -- and that, too, goes for investors. As we celebrate and honor Thanksgiving Day, I offer up five absolutely perfect stocks that investors can gobble up right now. Image source: Getty Images. Image source: Getty Images.

    "article_text":"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Hopes that vaccines will soon replace economic lockdowns as our best defense against the coronavirus have stirred speculation that value stocks will regain favor among investors. A guy who until recently oversaw $1.6 trillion has a strong argument that growth stocks will continue to be a better investment. Hiro Mizuno was chief investment officer of Japan\u2019s Government Pension Investment Fund for five years until the end of March. Now a Tesla Inc. board member and special adviser to Japan\u2019s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, here\u2019s what he tweeted at the weekend: Pitting the disruptive vision of entrepreneurs against the hopes of uncovering a real find amid the clutter of beaten down stocks provides a compelling way to frame the debate about whether growth stocks, classified as shares of companies with accelerating revenues, can keep outpacing value stocks, equities whose value is deemed not to reflect some measure of underlying worth. It seemed like the equation might be changing. Value stocks enjoyed a renaissance this month when vaccine euphoria prompted investors to rotate into shares trashed as the pandemic crimped the global economy. Their returns beat their growth counterparts by five percentage points in the first three weeks of November. That\u2019s sparked talk of a global revival. On Tuesday, Bank of America Corp. strategist Savita Subramanian recommended U.S. financial and energy stocks as her top two \u201cunapologetically cyclical and value-focused\u201d sectors. Strategists at Barclays Plc, led by Emmanuel Cau, on Wednesday recommended investors in European shares should overweight value versus growth. And John Woods, Credit Suisse Group AG\u2019s Asia Pacific CIO, said Asian value stocks will outperform in the next six months provided a vaccine becomes widely available. So could it finally be value stocks\u2019 turn in the sun? Investment advisers who\u2019ve called for a reversal of that trend have been proven wrong time and again. In the chart above, the biggest stocks in the Bloomberg Value Index include investment bank JPMorgan Chase & Co., telecoms operator AT&T Inc. and energy company Exxon Mobil Corp. The growth index is dominated by the FAANGS: Facebook Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Apple Inc., Netflix Inc. and Google\u2019s parent, Alphabet Inc. The picture doesn\u2019t change no matter the time period. So far this year, growth stocks have gained about 24%, while value stocks are down by 5%. In the past 12 months, growth is up by 28%, value down by 2.5%. Over three years, growth delivers 66% versus just 12% for value. And since early 2007, when the index histories begin, growth is up more than fourfold while value has a bit more than doubled in value. But hope for value stocks seems to spring eternal. A net 24% of investors overseeing $526 billion expect value to outperform growth the coming year, according to Bank of America\u2019s November survey. That\u2019s the most bullish call for value in the monthly poll since February 2019. Mizuno says that investment style fails to capture disruptors that sacrifice earnings early on to build a dominant market share. Jeff Bezos\u2019s Amazon is probably the best example of that kind of company. \u201cGrowth investing for me is to bet on the ability of CEO and his\/her staff to deliver more than people (including myself) can imagine,\u201d Mizuno also tweeted. By contrast, trying to identify value stocks takes a cocky \u2014 and risky \u2014 self-assurance that the wisdom of the investing crowd has missed something fundamental about a company\u2019s worth. If a share is cheap, it\u2019s probably cheap for a reason. You could even stretch the argument to cover the recent enthusiasm for Bitcoin versus gold. As my colleague Lionel Laurent recently pointed out, the digital currency barely figures in buying and selling in the real world and yet its gains have rapidly outpaced the yellow metal this year.Gold has real-world applications that make it inherently valuable, but many investors still view it as nothing more than a pet rock, limiting the potential universe of buyers. To its fans, Bitcoin represents a transformative technology with the potential to dislodge fiat currencies as a means of payment. In effect, it\u2019s a bet on the future of finance with a side wager that its momentum will continue apace \u2014 like a disruptive growth stock. The current enthusiasm for value stocks may well have further scope to run. But in the longer term, the trend that\u2019s been your friend seems likely to persist. Even once the pandemic is over, backing entrepreneurs will prove more profitable than buying allegedly undervalued equities in the hope that mean reversion will rescue them from the bargain basement.

    "article_text":"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Trade union Verdi called on workers at seven German Amazon warehouses to go on a three-day strike that will coincide with \"Black Friday\" discount shopping sales on Nov. 27. Scheduled to begin with Wednesday's night shift, Verdi is demanding better pay and working conditions. Verdi has been organising strikes at Amazon in Germany - the company's biggest market after the United States - since 2013, most recently last month during its \"Prime Day\" promotional event. An Amazon spokesman said at the time that the company offered \"excellent\" salaries, with benefits and working conditions comparable with other important employers. The U.S. retail giant has seen sales soar globally as restrictions to prevent the spread of the coronavirus sent consumers online, making it difficult for some bricks-and-mortar shops to compete. Verdi argues this has strengthened the case for higher wages, adding workers were not sufficiently protected against the spread of the coronavirus. Last week, Amazon bowed to government pressure in France to postpone its local Black Friday event by a week to help local shopkeepers struggling with a nationwide lockdown.

This video was recorded on November 23, 2020. Jason Moser: It's Monday, November 23rd. I'm your host Jason Moser. On this week's Financial show, we're digging into the recent S-1 filing for Affirm to get a closer look at what makes this business tick, and when it goes public, if it is a company that investors should have on their radar. We're also going to take a look at Berkshire Hathaway's most recent 13F filing to check out what team Buffett has been buying and selling recently. Joining me this week, it's bank analyst extraordinaire, John Maxfield. John, how's everything going? John Maxfield: Good. I think you need to set the expectations lower, Jason Moser. Moser: Come on! We've spoken before, you've got a track record out there, people know, I can't pull the wool over their eyes. [laughs] Maxfield: Yeah, you know what I'm going to do, I'm going to put my wife on here, she's going to tell you what the reality is. Moser: Well, my wife, I'm certain, could do the same thing, you know? But let's stay in our minds here and we'll think the best of us, and we'll let our wives think what they want to think; we don't have to bring that into the show. John, we were talking over the weekend. And we're seeing a lot of companies that are filing to go public here in the next few months, and it's been a lot of fun, because that's always something for us to dig into. And there is a business that just recently filed its S-1, a company called Affirm, and we wanted to dig into the S-1 for Affirm today and look under the hood here, understand a little bit more about what this business does, how it makes its money, what type of competitive advantage it has, if any, competitors in the space, you know, try to get a feel as if this is a company that investors really should have on their radar here, because it does look like it's going to be something that's going to be going public here very soon. And it's playing in that fintech space which offers a lot of interesting opportunities for sure. When I opened up this S-1 and started learning more about the business, I have to say, I was really impressed. I think it is pursuing a market that is becoming more and more an attractive space, particularly for your millennial generation, your Gen Z generations, and we'll talk about that focus on buy now, pay later. But let's talk first and foremost about what this business does. And its mission is very simple, and that is to deliver honest financial products that improve lives, but let's dig into that a little bit, talk a little bit about what Affirm does. Maxfield: Yeah. Sure. So, let me just start with this, because you mentioned their mission statement. Like, one of the things I think is interesting about a company, I think, you know, mission statements are actually really important and I like their mission statement. The reason I like their mission statement is because it's not like, we just want to be the best in whatever industry we are, but they actually kind of talk to an altruistic human desire. And I think that that is such an important thing to work backwards from. So, I just want to put a pin in that since you mentioned it, Jason, but in terms of what Affirm does as a company and as a business, it's a payments and financing platform for digital and mobile-first commerce. Okay, so what does that mean? Let's say you go to the Walmart website and you want to buy a new TV for Christmas. Well, when you add that to your cart and then you go to the checkout, you can have an option of clicking on a button that'll say \"Affirm,\" and then what that will do is that will allow you to finance that purchase. So, if it's a $1,000 TV, you can set it up so you can set up payments for that. So, it's basically a company that is lending money to consumers to make purchases. And so, you have kind of the lending aspect of it and the payments aspect of it. So, on a global perspective that's kind of how I think about its business model. Moser: Now, when you say lending money and allowing consumers to finance those purchases. And that really plays right into that \"buy now, pay later.\" We're seeing more and more companies offering those services. I think it's worth noting, and you know it's important to consider here, that Affirm is not a bank, right? I mean, they're not the ones actually lending that money, they're partnering with banks to actually provide that dynamic of the service, right? Maxfield: That's right. There is a bank that sits behind it, that's actually doing the underwriting. This is kind of like a lead generation business model for that bank, kind of, if you will. And the name of that bank is Cross River Bank, which is a really interesting bank, but for this purpose, yeah, it's just a bank that sits behind Affirm. Moser: So, when you look at how they make money, it seems like they make money a couple of different ways, from what I could see in the S-1. Clearly, for merchants, you can understand the value proposition with the merchant side, they earn a fee there when they help that merchant convert a sale. I thought it was interesting from the consumer side, that they interest essentially on those loans. I mean, let's just call them what they are. When you finance a product, I mean, that's a loan. And even if you have a banking partner, Affirm is playing a role in that value chain as well. It kind of feels like in today's environment, maybe there's not a whole heck of a lot of money to be [laughs] made on the lending side, but it is still a dynamic of the business model there. How do you feel about the way this company generates revenue? Do you feel like it opens them up for more avenues, more ways, more services to provide, or is it something that's going to be pretty cut-and-dry just on the merchant's side, on the consumer side? Maxfield: So, you're right, first of all, this is not a great time for businesses that earn interest, right, because interest rates are so low, but there are some important exceptions. And one of the important exceptions is in the consumer finance space, because these are unsecured loans to consumers, these generate a much higher interest rate than, say, a 30-year fixed rate mortgage. Which I don't know what the rate on a 30-year fixed rate mortgage is right now, but it's probably like, 2.8% -- I mean, for all intents and purposes that's nothing. Moser: Yeah, for all intents and purposes just use 3% as a round number, but yeah, it's pretty crazy right now, actually. Maxfield: Exactly. But so, the one area where you can generate more interest income, and this is true in any time period, but still today, is in consumer finance, because the risk of default is just a lot higher. And not only is the risk of default a lot higher, because in a sense you could think about these as credit card loans, in a sense, they're kind of a variation of that, but not only is the potential of loss higher, but what banks called the loss given default is higher. So, if you default on your mortgage, the bank is just going to come and take your house, and because in a conventional mortgage you got to put 20% down, the bank probably isn't going to, actually at the end of the day, isn't going to lose any money on it, because they'll take that collateral. Well, there isn't any collateral in a loan like this, you're not going to send somebody to go pick up a TV, because the cost of sending somebody to go pick up the TV is going to be higher than whatever the worth, the value of the TV is at that point. So, that's why they're able to earn more interest. Moser: All right, let's dig a little bit more into management here for a second, because we go back to the business, we talk about mission-driven. I mean, oftentimes, mission-driven businesses involve founder-leaders, founders who have a specific idea, specific vision of what they're really trying to accomplish. And it seems like in this case, I mean, you have Max Levchin, who is the Founder and the CEO of the business today, talk a little bit about leadership here, about management. Where do you feel like -- I mean, it is going to be a dual-class share system here. It is going to be another one of those companies where basically, you know, investors who want to consider this business have to understand that they are more or less just kind of jumping in the car here with Max and his team and trusting that they're going to make the right decisions. Maxfield: Yeah, so I'm probably not pronouncing his last name right, is that Levchin, is that how you say it? Moser: Well, yeah, I might be mispronouncing it, and I'm sorry, Max, if that's the case. But yeah, I was pronouncing it Levchin. Maxfield: Yeah, that's what it looks like to me too. So, this is an interesting story, because you know if you look at it. And I think First Republic Bank actually tracks founder led companies and how they perform relative to non-founder-led companies. And they have found that founder-led companies perform better over time. And there's a lot of reasons for that, one is that, they are just all-in on this thing. Not only do they tend to have a lot of financial skin in the game, but they are wrapped up in this thing as human beings, right, because it kind of reflects who they are. And so, then he goes on and does a few other things afterwards. So, what's awesome about that, from an investor's perspective is that this is not this guy's first rodeo. [laughs] He has been there and he has done that, which is really, really beneficial for an investor, because it means you're going to pay for fewer mistakes on his side. Moser: Yeah, I mean, that's a really important point there you made in regard to mistakes, I'm glad you said that. Maxfield: Yeah. But the other side of it is that, is this something that he's passionate about that he's going to be doing 20 years down the road? You know, if you look at his record, probably not. Now, that isn't to say that this is not a good investment for investors, because you know his track record is pretty good. And so, if Affirm eventually gets bought out by another company, maybe gets bought out at huge multiple, there could be a huge return for the investors, or if he hands it off to a CEO who's really capable and that CEO then grows it as an independent entity, it could be super-duper profitable as well from investor perspective. But when you think about it, this is a founder-led company, and I want you to tell me what you think, but I think of this as kind of a separate -- kind of its own flavor of founder-led company because of the serial nature of the entrepreneurship behind it. Moser: Well, yeah, I agree with you. I think you really keyed in on an angle that's important to remember, that when you have someone like Mr. Levchin, who's, let's say, he's a serial entrepreneur, you do pay less for those mistakes. Just they learn so much along the way and they don't repeat a lot of those mistakes. And so, the further down the road you get, a bit more of a compelling offering they bring to the table. And I think with a company like this, you know, I found a really interesting statistic in the S-1, something that just kind of made me think, and you know, it made me wonder about this business being founded. But it was focused on ultimately Gen Z and the millennial generations being the greatest proportion of our U.S. economy today, or over the U.S. consumer economy today. I mean, this is a business founded based on how those younger generations are spending their money. He's had a lot of time to think about this all along the way, given what he's done today. Maxfield: Yeah. No, absolutely. I mean, he understands this ecosystem. He understands this transformation, this technological transformation. I mean, Affirm has really important tailwinds behind it. 1., to your point, this generational shift, right? 2., the younger generations. And the younger generations tend to spend a larger proportion of their money online as opposed to in a physical store. So, you have that tailwind. And as that generation becomes a larger and larger portion, as these younger generations become larger and larger portion of overarching society, that will go up, and then the other, and you had kind of alluded to this earlier, Jason, it is this \"buy now, pay later\" tailwind that we're also seeing in the digital space, becoming a larger share of overarching purchases out there. So, it has these tailwinds that when you look at Levchin's background and being a part of PayPal and understanding how that whole dynamic works, you just can't help but think, like, he probably understands this at a very fundamental level and can kind of project forward better than most of us can. Moser: Yeah. And I mean, let's talk about that buy now, pay later dynamic a little bit more. You had mentioned, sort of, the riskier nature of transactions like these. You know, there's no real collateral to speak of right there. You're dealing with one-on-one consumer behavior, which in-and-of-itself can be a little bit riskier, but I mean that speaks to something the company is very, very focused on. I mean, it was built upon technology, right, it was built on this idea -- I mean, speaking of datapoints, I found another one here in the S-1 that I thought was really fascinating. A survey conducted by The Harris Poll in 2020 found that 64% of Americans would consider purchasing or applying for financial products through a technology company's platform instead of a traditional financial services provider. And then if you talk about Americans aged between 18 and 34 years, that sentiment rises to 81%. And so, you can see this shift, sort of, away from that old banking model toward this new partnership model, where even if banks don't want to do it at this point, I don't know that they really have a choice, banks almost have to partner up with some of these tech companies, because these tech companies are being built on different fundamentals, mission-driven fundamentals, tech-driven fundamentals, consumer-centric fundamentals, that perhaps a lot of these older banks have left behind for years and years, and now that's really becoming a little bit more of a consideration for consumers. But with a company that's built on tech like this, on data, on AI, there's a lot of potential for network effect there, right? The more people you get in there using it, the more merchants that want to use it, it feels like to me, while it may still very well be in the early stages, they could be building a meaningful competitive advantage. I mean, that doesn't seem out of the realm of possibility. Maxfield: Yeah, certainly if you look at their S-1. The network effects is the first competitive advantage that they cite. And the way they think about it is they say, like, look, if you give consumers a better experience, you'll get more consumers. If you get more consumers, you will have a stronger ecosystem. The reason you'll have a stronger ecosystem is because merchants will be a part of that and also because you'll have all that data. So, if you have a stronger ecosystem, you'll get more merchants, you get more merchants, you'll have additional products that they can offer, you have additional products, you can increase the gross merchandise volume that the overarching service provides. If you get that, then that can not only finance, but source better data insights, and then you can use those insights to improve the experience and then you have this flywheel effect. So, certainly they view network effects as a really important aspect of the competitive advantage. Now, the one thing I would say, and here's what's interesting, is that in this digital world that we live in, if you think about huge, big, big trends, big societal trends that we've seen over time, one of them is the power to make better decisions, and better decisions are based on better data, not only more data, but more timely data. And then the systems behind those things that allow you to analyze that data. Now, this is one of those business models that benefits a lot from data. And one of the reasons it benefits so much from data is because this is where you're lending money, when you lend money, risk management is so incredibly important, right? Because you go through a recession, loans like these are the ones that go bad fastest, because you're not going to lose your house, and not only that, nobody is going to come take the TV you bought. So, like, yeah, it'll ding your credit score, but it isn't going to hurt your life in the immediate future, which is what happens in the -- you know, that's how people start thinking in those time periods. But what I found was, what was really interesting is that in the banking industry, in the fintech industry vis-a-vis banking, one of the pitches that all of these companies are making is that, look, because we have all this data, we can make better credit decisions. And so, what you found in their S-1, as I say, one of the selling points to Affirm is that, we approve 20% more customers than our competitive products, and that's a benefit and a detriment, it is a benefit to the merchants, because then the merchants are selling more things. But now on the other side of it, you have to say, well, what are these other companies, are the other companies missing something or the other companies just being more prudent? And you don't know this until you go through a cycle with one of these companies, that's where the rubber meets the road, but that was one of the things that I was thinking like, uh, I've heard this thing over and over again in the fintech community about using data to improve credit analysis. And while I understand that theoretically, the proof is in the pudding on that one, and nobody is -- since we're in Thanksgiving week talking about food -- that pudding hasn't been made yet by anybody. Moser: Yeah, I mean that is just it. You can talk the talk, but then you need to walk the walk, and I mean, I've certainly seen businesses -- there was a business, years ago, that PayPal acquired international remittance company Xoom, and you know part of their secret sauce, as David Gardner likes to say, is their risk assessment. They had proprietary risk models that really helped them minimize losses on those remittances. And you see, Square, with a big focus that way as well. I guess, we start talking about risks with a business like this and it leads me to, you know, the first obvious question, I feel like, with something like Affirm, and we're seeing this right now with Square applying for a bank charter, what's the possibility that Affirm at some point or another decides they want to try to become a bank, is that something that just, because that's taking on a whole new level of not only risk but regulatory compliance and commitments and, you know, capital maintenance requirements that that will never go away. So, you become a bank, you take a little bit of that slick sort of high margin tech model away, don't you? Maxfield: Yes. You become a bank; there's a lot to your point. The expense that you incur because of the stringent regulatory environment is not insignificant by any stretch of the imagination. That being said, there is an expense of not being a bank, and that is, to cut out the middleman, right? Right now, Cross River Bank is the \"middleman,\" and so, if you look at their business model, so you go in, you buy a TV, Affirm makes a loan to you, Affirm takes that loan, and that loan just goes straight to Cross River Bank, but what Affirm will do is, it'll buy those loans back from Cross River, and there's a cost associated with that. So, you take out that cost -- the question is, by taking out that cost, would that cost outweigh the cost of being a bank? I don't know that, I'm sure that is something that they would dig into. But the other thing that needs to be appreciated is that these are the types of loans that banks have historically stayed away from. These are, you know, I don't want to call them hard money loans, but these are those types of loans. And banks already kind of get a bad name for making money off of other people's money. Well, if you're going into those niches in the market where the interest rate is super high, well, that's where, kind of, banks have historically gotten a bad name from, which is another interesting thing to think about. You think like, well, would Affirm want to go down that regulatory path and be a regulated bank given the fact that they operate within this niche. And the other thing you need to think about is, like, well, would Affirm be a potential acquisition target of a bank? Like, would a bank want that portfolio on its balance sheet? And I don't know the answer to that, but it's certainly something to consider. Moser: Yeah, we've certainly batted that question around more than once, as to why, you know, someone like a JPMorgan wouldn't have thought about acquiring something like a Square back in the day [laughs] when it was far more affordable. But that's water under the bridge at this point, I guess. One thing I noticed, and I would call this out, as probably the risk that really, the concern, I think, that really stood out to me the most, they have one really big customer, don't they, John? Maxfield: One really big customer, yeah, I mean, Walmart, is that ... Moser: No, I'm sorry, Affirm. Yeah, I don't know if you saw, but Peloton actually represents a lot of their total revenue. I was impressed to see this. You know it could be the sword that cuts both ways, I guess, because Peloton is, obviously, doing really well. And I think they've got a lot of runway there, Peloton. But Peloton represented approximately 28% of Affirm's total revenue for the fiscal year ended June 30th, 2020, and 30% of total revenue for the three months ended September 30th, 2020. So, just something worth keeping in mind, anytime you see these businesses and they're new and they're young and they're just getting their feet underneath them. And, you know, having a big client is something you want, you want that belief, right, you want a client that's willing to commit and say, listen, this is our partner, this is the company that's making us work here, but it's also something to keep in mind. They do make a lot of money from Peloton, and any loss of that revenue, partial or otherwise, that would be something that would be a significant hit, at least in the near-term, I'm not saying that's a long-term concern there. But we saw recently with another very popular name in the Foolish universe, not a financial holding, but the company Fastly, the edge computing content delivery network. You know, Fastly lost that TikTok revenue stream, which had become something like 13% or 14% overall. I mean, I'm not saying that's fatal to the business, right, I'm not saying that, but certainly the market reacted negatively to it, and it's something that's going to play out in the near-term. And as Fastly tries to, you know, shore that up and find ways to replace that revenue. Maxfield: Yeah. You know, I missed that in the S-1, and that's a really significant fact... it's not a fatal factor for an investor by any stretch of imagination, but that is something that should be kept in mind. And for this reason, in particular, given where we are at right now, and that's because this home exercise stuff is just killing it right now. That's not going to be the case at all times. So, not only do you have, like, the potential that it could lose that relationship, but maybe that relationship becomes less profitable. Again, not fatal, but a really important variable to consider. Moser: Yeah. And when these IPOs go public, there's usually a lot of enthusiasm, the valuations become a little bit detached from the fundamentals of the business, so just something to keep in mind at least. But knowing everything that we know, knowing what we've discussed today, I'd be interested to hear your take on this. I mean, is this the kind of business that you would be interested in as an investor or is it maybe a little bit outside of your comfort zone? Maxfield: Well, it's not outside of my comfort zone, because it's very much, kind of, what I look at, what I think about in terms of businesses. Would it be something that I would invest in? That's a really good question, let me answer it in -- let me go off on a tangent and answer that in part, OK. IPOs are killing it right now. IPOs, so if you look at the Renaissance U.S. IPO Index performance that year-to-date the companies gone public are up 88%, the S&P 500 is up 12%. So, this is an amazing time to go public for the companies that are going public. Now, is it as good on the other side for the investors that are buying in? That remains to be seen. And the reason the IPOs are doing so well, especially tech IPOs, is that when interest rates come down as far as they've come, you just can't make as much money in the bond market. And the bond market is this huge monster relative to the equities market. And so, when you have these bond investors, you have these asset managers, these wealth management folks, who need to earn a certain yield on their investment, so what they'll do is they'll take a small chunk of their bond portfolios and then allocate it over to their equity portfolios. Well, [laughs] because the bond market is so much bigger, it's just a small sliver of that that's got to come over to equities to really drive this stuff up. And then we think within the world of equities, there are certain ones that are doing particularly well, and those are, and you mentioned this, fintech companies is one of that, you know, one of that, kind of, subsectors of companies that are doing really well. And you're thinking, like, why are fintech companies doing well? Well, technology companies are doing well, because in this environment everything is remote, so everybody is buying stuff online, everybody is doing stuff digitally, as opposed to in-person, but fintech companies in particular, they have benefit from this kind of trend in the financial space toward -- like, kind of, this transformation toward digital financial transactions. And so, these are huge tailwinds that are just shooting up equity valuations in that space. So, I would be reluctant, just as a general rule, to buy into that, because the valuations are so high, as a general rule. But that doesn't mean [laughs] that I have missed more [...] investments than I've made, Jason, OK, so I'm not saying that people should avoid it. But just the way I invest, that's probably not the direction I would go in for that simple reason. Moser: Yeah. No, I'm with you, I think this is one that I'm fascinated by the business, I'm not 100% sold on just the \"buy now, pay later\" opportunity, I think I'd be more encouraged if I saw them branching out in other direction, it's certainly one that I'd follow it, and I'd want to know more about it more and learn more about it. But I've learned through the years that, for the most part, IPOs, you want to let them go for a little while, let them prove themselves. And I think in this case, I would view this no differently. And for investors, we do not have at least a date set; there has been no date set for this IPO. It sounds like it's going to be something that comes out here soon in December. It'll be trading under the ticker AFRM, for Affirm. So, keep an eye out for that. And yeah, we'll certainly be following it along here on the show as this story unfolds, because it sounds like a really neat business and one that we're going to learn more about. John, before we wrap things up this week -- team Buffett. Team Buffett out there in Omaha, they've been doing a little buying and little selling. They filed their recent 13F. And that 13F, as many folks know, that's the form that institutional money managers are required to file 45 days after the end of each quarter, and that tells us what these money managers have been doing, buying and selling-wise, with the stocks that they own. And you know, not a lot of surprises out there with what's been going on. It seems like there maybe was a little bit of profit-taking on some of that Apple position. But I'm wondering if any of those transactions on the buy side or the sell side for Berkshire Hathaway this quarter stood out to you? Maxfield: Well, just in broad strokes, I mean, this was -- your point about Team Buffett as opposed to Buffett, I think is spot on. I think when you look at what it's doing, this is not Warren Buffett sitting there making all these decisions, right? Moser: I think you're right. Maxfield: I mean, he's got his two money managers that are, kind of, behind him -- you have Todd and Ted -- these guys are, I think, making a lot of these decisions. You know, let me just kind of walk through the things that stuck out to me. They sold their Costco position. Moser: That was the one that stood out to me more than anything. And it wasn't that they trimmed it, they sold the entire thing. Maxfield: Sold the whole thing. And when you think about -- Moser: Why? Why do you think they did that? Maxfield: I don't know! But you think about, like, Costco is a Buffett company, you know what I mean. I mean, it's just simple, so profitable, just doing so well. I don't know the answer to why they sold; obviously, they don't tell me. [laughs] I don't know. But I thought that was really interesting. Do you have a hypothesis on that? Moser: The only thing I could fathom was that, just a massive return on an investment that's done very well. Perhaps they felt like, you know, it had done what it could do in this newfangled, sort of, e-commerce Amazon world. I mean, Costco is not known for its e-commerce prowess, so... I mean, going back to team Buffett, I feel like this decision certainly went beyond him. I could see Charlie and Warren just saying, hey, we're very happy with it. So, maybe it went beyond them. Maxfield: Yeah, I'm just bewildered by that one. But another big trend I saw in the 13F, and I'm sure you did too, is that they went in big on pharma stocks and pharmaceutical companies. And not only just one. So, you think like, OK, well, were they betting on the company that is going to come up with the vaccine or was this more of a general investment thesis that pharmaceutical stocks is going to be a good place to be over the years to come? Looks to me like it's more of the latter. They went in on Pfizer, they went in on a Bristol Myers, they went in on Merck. So, they went in on, I think, four different companies, bought a relatively substantial stake, although for Berkshire, what's a few billion bucks each, right? But they are betting heavily on the pharmaceutical companies. And whether that's because of this COVID situation right now or whether that's maybe because, you know, they see the change in demographics in the United States, as this baby boomer generation continues to age, maybe they see that as a fertile field for investment thesis. I don't know, but it's certainly one of the larger things that they did. Moser: Yeah. Yeah, I think there are probably a few things playing into that. And perhaps a little bit of a consolidation in the space, maybe looking years down the road, recognizing the role that those pharmas play in our lives, the roles they're going to continue to play, how important they are and ensuring that they're [laughs] well-capitalized. And frankly, I'd much rather see him, you know, allocating capital to those types of businesses as opposed to oil and gas. Nothing against oil and gas, it just feels like the world is headed in a little bit of a different direction that's going to be, kind of, a long slow bleed there. But yeah, it's always interesting to see what they're doing with their money there. And of course, we talked earlier in the year about is, position in Snowflake, which was clearly strictly tech, obviously data, probably not something that Mr. Buffett or Mr. Munger was behind. And a modest investment in the context of their portfolio. But just, yeah, always good to look at that 13F and see what they're doing. You know, we're not copying it by any means, but it's always worth knowing, it's always worth thinking about, because it can help you see things from a few different angles, and that's really what investing is all about. Well, John, listen, I think that's going to do it for us this week. Man! I really appreciate you sitting in and taking the time to join us. Maxfield: Yeah, my pleasure. Anytime, Jason.

    "url":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/amazon-workers-germany-strike-black-223000962.html",
    "article_text":"FRANKFURT, Nov 25 (Reuters) - Trade union Verdi called on workers at seven German Amazon warehouses to go on a three-day strike that will coincide with \"Black Friday\" discount shopping sales on Nov. 27. Scheduled to begin with Wednesday's night shift, Verdi is demanding better pay and working conditions. Verdi has been organising strikes at Amazon in Germany - the company's biggest market after the United States - since 2013, most recently last month during its \"Prime Day\" promotional event. An Amazon spokesman said at the time that the company offered \"excellent\" salaries, with benefits and working conditions comparable with other important employers. The U.S. retail giant has seen sales soar globally as restrictions to prevent the spread of the coronavirus sent consumers online, making it difficult for some bricks-and-mortar shops to compete. Verdi argues this has strengthened the case for higher wages, adding workers were not sufficiently protected against the spread of the coronavirus. Last week, Amazon bowed to government pressure in France to postpone its local Black Friday event by a week to help local shopkeepers struggling with a nationwide lockdown.

    "url":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/stock-trader-guide-black-friday-130000810.html",
    "article_text":"(Bloomberg) -- Pandemic-driven lockdowns, shuttered malls and stuck-at-home consumers have hurt retailers in 2020 as Covid-19 ravaged the economy. With Black Friday almost underway, equity traders are bracing for a holiday season where brick-and-mortar businesses that lack strong digital platforms could suffer. For the first time ever, more consumers intend to shop online than in stores, a Deloitte survey shows. U.S. online holiday sales will total $189 billion, shattering all previous records with a 33% boost from last year, according to Adobe Analytics. That\u2019s equal to two years\u2019 growth in one season. \u201cThis year is unlike anything else,\u201d said Ken Perkins, president and founder of Retail Metrics. \u201cPeople are going to be really adverse to come into stores on Black Friday, so traffic will be relatively more modest. Curbside pick will be extremely important this holiday season. Impulse buying will also fall off as online shopping tends to be very targeted.\u201d Mall-based retailers have been among the most battered stocks of 2020 amid rapid changes in consumer behavior as lockdowns resulted in less need for some items and accelerated the shift toward e-commerce and away from physical stores. But with promising vaccine trial results coming through, signaling consumers might be ready to go back to the mall, retail stocks have been soaring. The S&P 1500 Apparel Retail Index erased its pandemic-spurred losses earlier this month, while the S&P 1500 Retailing Index hit a record high in October. Here\u2019s a look at some potential stock winners and losers in an unprecedented holiday shopping season. Year-to-date stock performance follows each name. Electronics With the release of new Xbox and PlayStation devices, gaming consoles are coveted and will be \u201calmost impossible to get your hands on,\u201d Perkins said. In addition, home-related electronics will be extremely popular. Electronics like personal computers, televisions, tablets and virtual-reality accessories have also been in high demand, according to a recent data analysis from NPD Group\/Retail Tracking Service. Key stocks: Best Buy Co. (+30%), Rent-a Center Inc. (+24%), Aaron\u2019s Holdings Co. (+13%), Conn\u2019s Inc. (-7.3%) and Acco Brands Corp. (-13%). Toys Pandemic spending earlier this year, won\u2019t hold parents back from holiday shopping. They are likely to spend \u201cthe same or more\u201d on toys this season, according to DA Davidson analyst Linda Bolton Weiser, who cited research done by Mattel Inc.\u2018s executives. \u201cThe pandemic did not represent a pull-forward of holiday demand,\u201d Weiser said. Furthermore, Mattel\u2019s core brands probably added shelf space as retailers are \u201cfilling their aisles with traditional evergreen brands like Barbie and Hot Wheels\u201d because there are fewer toys this year that are based on entertainment properties. Key stocks: Mattel (+16%), Hasbro Inc. (-13%), Amazon.com Inc. (+72%), Walmart Inc. (+28%) and Target Corp. (+40%). Home Goods The boom in suburban living has resulted in strong sales at home furnishing companies. \u201cEven with the vaccine coming, people are moving out of the city, into the burbs, and they need to fill their homes,\u201d Perkins at Retail Metrics said. Williams-Sonoma Inc. said on a recent call that demand for its products had continued into November, while TJX Cos. executives said on its third-quarter call that HomeGoods will be \u201cone of the healthiest divisions\u201d moving into the new year. Key stocks: Williams-Sonoma (+53%) and TJX (+2.9%). E-commerce & Fintech Online transactions are likely to continue to surge as Covid-19 cases rise globally, and with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention calling shopping in crowded stores during the holiday period a \u201chigher risk\u201d activity. Read more: Virus Spreads Out Black Friday Shopping, Puts Digital at Fore Internet retail names that target a more affluent consumer also stand to gain, KeyBanc said in its holiday outlook report. In addition, companies that have added customers during the pandemic could convert them into holiday shoppers, while others are well positioned to steal market share from struggling retailers if lockdowns continue. Key stocks: Square Inc. (+240%) and PayPal Holdings Inc. (+98%), Farfetch Ltd. (+417%), Nordstrom Inc. (-33%), Peloton Interactive Inc. (+276%), Etsy Inc. (+228%), Amazon, Walmart and Target. Lockdown Hurdles Department store retailers will face hurdles this holiday season, according to several Wall Street analysts. All department stores saw \u201csteep\u201d drops in online traffic ahead of Thanksgiving, said CFRA Research analyst Camilla Yanushevsky, while Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Poonam Goyal said early Black Friday sales and holiday shopping would give department stores \u201ca much-needed boost.\u201d Cleveland Research was turning cautious on the holiday outlook for department stores, while JPMorgan Chase & Co. analyst Matthew Boss recently cut fourth-quarter same-store sales estimates to below-consensus levels. Meanwhile, Marshal Cohen, NPD\u2019s chief industry adviser for retail expects fashion and beauty categories to be \u201cfaced with the challenge of making up lost ground in hopes of a healthy finish to 2020.\u201d Key stocks: Macy\u2019s Inc. (-35%) and Nordstrom. (Updates share price moves throughout.) \u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P."

    "article_text":"(Bloomberg) -- Amazon.com Inc.\u2019s cloud-computing division suffered an outage on Wednesday that affected several customers, including Roku Inc. and Adobe Inc. Amazon Web Services\u2019s status page noted that its Kinesis data streaming service was \u201ccurrently impaired\u201d in the company\u2019s U.S. East 1 region. The outages were also making it harder to post updates to a closely watched status page, the company said. The failure affected the ability of customers to use roughly two dozen services, hitting streaming hardware maker Roku, software seller Adobe and digital photo service Flickr. \u201cKinesis has been experiencing increased error rates this morning in our US-East-1 Region that\u2019s impacted some other AWS services,\u201d a company spokeswoman said in an emailed statement. \u201cWe are working toward resolution.\u201d AWS is the largest provider of rented computing power and software services, and its data centers serve as the invisible foundation of much of the internet. That gives failures in its services an immediate visibility that rivals like Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google sometimes don\u2019t face. AWS is a collection of more than 175 software services, from data storage to a range of databases and machine-learning software. Customers often use more than one, linking them together in ways that can cause a failure in one system to cascade across multiple programs. The Seattle-based company operates those services from 24 regions, or clusters of data centers, geographic redundancy designed to station computing power close to customers while limiting the chance that a failure in any single region will result in permanent loss of data. U.S. East-1, which relies on data centers clustered in northern Virginia, is among AWS\u2019s most important regions, analysts say. Kinesis Data Streams, the service at the root of Wednesday\u2019s outage, captures and performs analytics on data, including social media feeds, dumps of public records and internal application usage logs, which can be then be fed into a variety of other software programs. Jaspreet Singh, chief executive officer of Druva Inc., a data backup and disaster recovery software maker that uses AWS services, said his engineers first noticed the outage early Wednesday morning when the flow of notifications from an AWS data monitoring service were disrupted. While the outage didn\u2019t completely sever access to a critical AWS service, it seemed to touch more products than previous outages, Singh said. \u201cTypically what tends to happen is one service goes down\u201d for a half hour or so, he said. \u201cThis is a different kind of issue. It\u2019s bigger. Things are failing internally.\u201d (Updates with detail on AWS and quote from AWS customer, beginning in the sixth paragraph.) \u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P."

    "article_text":"For Immediate Release Chicago, IL \u2013 November 25, 2020 \u2013 Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include Alibaba BABA and Amazon AMZN. The bottom is in for Alibaba. After 9 consecutive red days and shaving off over $160 billion in market value (plummeting 20%) in just two weeks, BABA is finally bouncing\u2026hard. BABA shares have driven up 10% since it bottomed out last Wednesday (November 18th) and now appear to be headed back towards $300. China's challenging regulatory system flexed its muscles this November, catalyzing a cascade of sell-offs. It started with Jack Ma's public criticism of the Chinese government and its financial system. Xi's communist regime did not appreciate the critique and retaliated in full force. In the first week of November, Chinese officials suspended what was expected to be the largest IPO in public equity history. Ant Group is the shining star of China's fintech space, and Alibaba holds a 33% stake in this innovative financial behemoth. Chinese regulators have been probing Ant's micro-loan business since the fintech powerhouse began preparing its shares for its public debut. Two days before the anticipated IPO, Ant's listing was suspended, citing a change in fintech regulations. Then in the domino effect of Jack Ma's regretful critiques, regulators released draft-rules on Wednesday concerning anti-competitive behavior, seemingly targeting Alibaba. Leading to another share price drop off. China regulators are sending a wake-up call to Jack Ma and the rest of the Chinese tech industry to who is running the show. Xi's administration felt that Jack Ma's economic influence (Alibaba & Ant Group) challenged the country's power and control. Jack Ma has since said that he believes the financial changes that regulators are implementing are timely and necessary, yielding to the authority of the communist party. At the end of the day, China has no intention of disrupting its strongest tech giants. This was more of a powerplay by Chinese regulators to remind its domestic tech titans who really holds the cards.\u00a0 BABA shares whiplash sell-off has created a fantastic opportunity to purchase one of Asia's highest potential enterprises at a substantial discount. From a technical and fundamental point of view, this stock is a buy. From a technical point of view, BABA was quite oversold last Wednesday when it bottomed. You can see my oscillators circled in red below, pointing to oversold. Now BABA has done a complete reversal and has robust upward momentum on its side. Alibaba has a cornucopia of digital products at its disposal, and it will use all of them to control and profit off the prolific digitalization occurring in Asia today. The fact that the Amazon of the East, BABA has not taken off to the extent of its western counterpart is baffling. Alibaba controls the e-commerce space (80% market share), the cloud-computing category (roughly 50% market share), and a 33% stake in the leading FinTech in the most populous and soon-to-be largest economy on earth. Alibaba is valued at less than half of Amazon despite producing substantially wider margins, greater profitability, and having a more extensive revenue growth outlook for the next couple of years. Alibaba just had its biggest shopping period of the year: \u2018Singles Day\u2019 (11\/11), and the results were not disappointing. Singles Day discounts lasted 11-days and generated over $74 billion in gross merchandise value, almost doubling last year\u2019s results. BABA was undervalued before this November sell-off. Today the stock is a stronger buy than ever with robust upward momentum, 16 out of 16 analysts calling this a buy. BABA still has a massive amount of upside potential, just waiting to be priced in. The Chinese economy is beginning to recover past pre-COVID growth rates, with Alibaba's digital technology being the centerpiece to this expansion. Ant's IPO delay and the anti-trust 'draft-rules' are just a small hiccup in Alibaba's tech dominance in the East. BABA's dip below $300 presents us with a savvy long-term buying opportunity. Be among the early investors in the new type of device that experts say could impact society as much as the discovery of electricity. Current technology will soon be outdated and replaced by these new devices. In the process, it\u2019s expected to create 22 million jobs and generate $12.3 trillion in activity. A select few stocks could skyrocket the most as rollout accelerates for this new tech. Early investors could see gains similar to buying Microsoft in the 1990s.

    "url":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/video\/heres-tv-shows-binge-watching-180805191.html",
    "article_text":"Yahoo Finance\u2019s Alexandra Canal shares which TV shows and movies people should watch with their families this long Thanksgiving weekend. [MUSIC PLAYING] AKIKO FUJITA: Netflix has a new champion on its hands-- or a chess champion, to be exact. A record 62 million households watched the hit show \"Queen's Gambit\" in the first month. That makes it the biggest limited series to date for Netflix. One of many shows, of course, that Americans are sure to be watching over this Thanksgiving weekend. Let's bring in Ali Canal, who is looking through all these shows for us on which ones are most binge worthy as we go into the long weekend. Ali? ALEXANDRA CANAL: Exactly, Akiko. It's Thanksgiving. We have Black Friday. So of course they're going to be binging on turkey and gravy. But we've got to binge on our TV and our movies as well. And you're absolutely right when it comes to \"The Queen's Gambit.\" Netflix has been championing this show all over the place. They are super proud of it. As you mentioned, over 60 million users tuned in to watch, according to the company. Now I do want a caveat that because Netflix does account for its viewership a bit differently than traditional TV. They account a viewer as someone who has watched a piece of content for at least two minutes. That's significantly less than some other TV metrics out there. But regardless, you cannot deny how successful this show has been. And even beyond just television, we're seeing the ripple effects. Google searches on how to play chess hit a nine-year high. Chess boards have been flying off of the shelves. eBay, other platforms, have seen growth of over 120% when it comes to sales. And it's all thanks to this show. Now, it does deal with some darker themes such as addiction. But the acting is absolutely incredible. Anya Taylor-Joy is fantastic. So it's certainly one show to keep on your radar. And I did speak to one company called Reelgood, which is a streaming hub that hosts all of your different streaming devices in one place. So they have some really good insight when it comes to what consumers are watching right now. And the week leading up to the holiday, \"The Queen's Gambit,\" no surprise, is at number one. That's followed by Disney Plus's \"The Mandalorian,\" HBO's \"The Undoing,\" Paramount's \"Yellowstone,\" and Netflix's other bingeable series \"The Crown.\" And I know that's bingeable because my mother watched the entire season in a weekend, maybe even less than that. It came out on November 15th. Already getting a lot of Emmy buzz. People seem to be really interested in the royals right now. There are several Princess Diana documentaries available on Netflix. So if the royals are your cup of tea, if you will, that streamer is certainly one to watch. Now when it comes to some other content out there, maybe you want something a little lighter, something a little more fun. I would recommend \"Schitt's Creek.\" Now \"Schitt's Creek\" absolutely dominated the 2020 Primetime Emmy Awards. It walked away with seven primetime wins, including Outstanding Comedy Series. It is also the only show in the drama categories and the comedy categories to have swept all four acting wins. So they certainly have the accolades out there. And even though it's a show that airs on Pop TV, all six seasons are currently available on Netflix. Another comedy that I'm keeping my eye on is \"Ted Lasso,\" which is on Apple TV Plus. Now we normally wouldn't gravitate towards this type of series, but the reviews have been pretty amazing. The Hollywood Reporter is saying that it has a big heart. And because of the coronavirus pandemic, people seem to be really craving that escapism right now, something that could tug at your heartstrings, something a little lighter. And \"Ted Lasso\" certainly delivers that. And then, finally, I want to talk about the movies that we can binge, specifically Hollywood-- I'm sorry, holiday movies, because Reelgood told me that interest in those Thanksgiving, Christmas movies, that's been peaking in the week leading up to this long weekend. According to Real Good, number one is \"Elf.\" That's always a classic. It gets me in the mood. Followed by \"Planes, Trains and Automobiles,\" \"A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving,\" \"Home Alone,\" and then my personal favorite, \"National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation.\" So this is certainly enough to get everyone started. I know this is a year where we have not had a lot of content. Movie theaters are still largely shut down across the country, especially as cases continue to rise. A lot of those blockbusters that we have been looking forward to are now being pushed into 2021, potentially 2022. And even some series that were renewed have now been canceled because of the pandemic. There was certainly backlash after Netflix canceled both \"Glow\" and \"The Society.\" But despite all of that, there is still a lot of entertainment out there. There are still a lot of things to watch. I know some of us are not going to be with our families due to this pandemic. So it's a perfect time. Some self-care, sit back, eat a turkey leg, watch your favorite show. It's a great time. BRIAN CHEUNG: Hey, Ali, Brian here. I want to ask about the holiday movies bit. What's been interesting is that I think Netflix has its own original content, too. I'm a huge Vanessa Hudgens fan, so I know that there's \"The Princess Switch,\" the sequel, even though the first one wasn't rated that well. But [INAUDIBLE] Vanessa Hudgens, you've got me hooked. So I guess the question here is, is this really going to impinge or encroach on the Hallmark Channel kind of territory? Is there expected to be more interest in these quick, cheap holiday films with people stuck at home? ALEXANDRA CANAL: Yeah, Netflix really seems to really be leaning into this genre. And it's not just Christmas. If we think about a \"Kissing Booth\" and \"The Kissing Booth 2,\" there's a third one coming out. Again, that cheesy romcom vibe, people really want that content. And I think because of the environment that we're in right now, because people are sort of desperate to not think about coronavirus, not think about the economy or the election, all these crazy headlines that we've been dealing with, they want some of that cheesiness. \"The Princess Switch 2,\" I watched the first one. I still have to watch the second one. My brother and my mom watched it last night. And I am a huge Vanessa Hudgens fan, so I will certainly be tuning in. But that's been a huge success in Netflix. And they wouldn't keep doing these sequels if they weren't attracting that audience demand. So I do think that they are taking a cue from the Lifetime, Hallmark movies. But at the end of the day, Hallmark is sort of the quintessential Christmas romcom. So I think they're still going to maintain their position. But Netflix is certainly leaning into it as well. AKIKO FUJITA: Wow. Ali and Brian Cheung professing their love for Vanessa Hudgens. ALEXANDRA CANAL: Oh, god. AKIKO FUJITA: An unexpected turn here on Yahoo Finance. I actually have never watched a movie that she has been in, but I have started bingeing \"The Crown.\" I'm way behind on the first season, still three episodes in, but certainly-- ALEXANDRA CANAL: Talk to my mom, Akiko. She's got that covered."

    "article_text":"The latest surge in coronavirus cases, coupled with the government\u2019s failure to pass another stimulus package, is exacerbating the stress and anxiety felt by hundreds of thousands of retailers nationwide. \u201cI fear if we continue to have the coronavirus cases we're having right now, and that we experience some type of additional lockdown, we will have a lot of empty storefronts across our country,\u201d Tom McGee, International Council of Shopping Centers CEO, told Yahoo Finance Live, adding that the situation is about to go from bad to worse. \u201cI think it's critical for the government to act.\u201d \u201cWe're at the epicenter of the crisis,\u201d said McGee. \u201cWhile the CARES Act was good for staff, the government needs to do a whole lot more. I wish they would have done it yesterday and certainly would like them to act now. There's so much pressure, particularly on small businesses, which are 70% of the tenants in shopping centers around the country. \u201c Some lawmakers are pushing for targeted commercial rent relief as retailers do all they can to combat the pandemic. In a letter to Biden earlier this month, New York state Senator Michael Gianaris pushed for rent forgiveness, writing \u201cWe need robust and targeted residential and commercial rent relief, ideally in the form of rent cancellation and forgiveness. Access to no\/low interest loans would also be a great help, so that people can remain in their homes and maintain their places of business until they can get back on their feet.\u201d \u201cDepartment stores are dying\u2026 When we look at the October [retail sales] number, these are dying segments,\u201d said Storch. \u201cDon't think for a second that anybody needs a department store in this world. They disappeared a long time ago in most countries, and that's what's going to happen [in the U.S.].\u201d While 2020 has certainly been a tough year for retailers, 2021 might not offer much relief. The rising coronavirus case count has prompted state and local governments to implement tighter restrictions, placing further strain on those retailers already suffering from the changing retail landscape. \u201cThere is going to be massive store closures and huge bankruptcies in the future,\u201d said Storch. \u201cIt's going to lead to massive consolidation, because the big guys are going to get bigger and eat up all the share, and the little guys are going totally out of business.\u201d READ MORE:"

We note that customers using the new service will only have to pay for what they will use, without any upfront payment.This along with the above-mentioned benefits is likely to bolster the adoption rate of Amazon MWAA.Notably, customers like The Pokemon Company International, Rocket Mortgage and GoDaddy already benefited from using the latest service.We believe that growing customer momentum will continue to drive AWS\u2019 top line. Moreover, strengthening clientele will continue to aid its competitive edge against its peers like Microsoft MSFT, Alphabet\u2019s GOOGL Google and Alibaba BABA.Per the latest Canalys data, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud and Alibaba Cloud acquired worldwide cloud market share of 19%, 7% and 6% in third-quarter 2020, respectively, while Amazon led with 32% share.

The tool provides more than 250 pre-built transformations to automate data preparation tasks.Further, the company made its new Amazon EC2 capability namely AWS Nitro Enclaves generally available.

    "headline":"Amazon Merchants Say Deliveries of Some Products Are Delayed",
    "url":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/amazon-merchants-deliveries-products-delayed-165323293.html",
    "article_text":"(Bloomberg) -- Amazon.com Inc. merchants around the U.S. say some products that normally reach customers in one or two days are now taking a week or longer just as the world\u2019s largest online retailer heads into what\u2019s expected to be a record-busting holiday shopping season. Seven merchants and consultants from California, Texas, Wisconsin and Florida said they had to ship products ordinarily handled by Amazon\u2019s logistics service -- which is typically faster and cheaper. To the sellers, that suggests the company\u2019s warehouses and delivery stations are at full capacity. The development, which began over the weekend and continued this week, worries the merchants because web shopping will peak in the five-day period from Thanksgiving to Cyber Monday, the biggest online spending day of the year. Their experience was echoed by more than a dozen additional sellers in merchant chat rooms viewed by Bloomberg. Amazon continues to deliver most products in one or two days through its logistics service, the merchants said. But because the company has issued no warning or explanation, they said it\u2019s hard to figure out if any specific product categories are being affected or whether the shift is happening more in some regions than others. One seller said Amazon seems to be prioritizing best-selling products for its own delivery system and letting merchants handle less popular items, echoing what happened earlier this year when Amazon was overwhelmed by panicked shoppers stuck at home when Covid-19 first swept the country. In an emailed statement, an Amazon spokesman said a few anecdotes from merchants don\u2019t necessarily add up to a broader problem. \u201cWe have not changed how offers are presented to customers to shift volume from Amazon fulfillment to seller fulfillment,\u201d he said. \u201cAs always, product offers continue to compete to be the featured offer based on a variety of factors, including lowest price, availability, fastest delivery speed and best seller performance.\u201d U.S. shoppers will spend $189 billion in November and December, up 33% from a year earlier and more than double the usual pace of growth, according to Adobe Inc. Amazon captures about 40 cents of every dollar spent online in the U.S., meaning the company is under enormous pressure to keep customers happy. Amazon shipping times averaged a little more than two days during the week of Nov. 2, when consumers took a break from shopping for the election, according to the most recent data from Rakuten Intelligence. Amazon has rushed to increase capacity since the pandemic hit -- hiring 250,000 workers and spending billions on new warehouses and delivery stations. To ensure it has enough people to pick, pack and ship orders, the company has been offering signing bonuses of as much as $3,000 to new hires. Even so, the merchants said, it appears Amazon is struggling to keep up. Molson Hart, who sells stuffed animals and games on Amazon, said about 70% of his inventory is being delayed as much as one week. Amazon is prioritizing the most in-demand products for fast delivery while slower-selling products are subject to delays, he said. \u201cWe can expect even longer delays and delivery disruptions come next week, when shipping volumes rise as much as five times,\u201d Hart said. \u201cThe past couple of years, consumers grew accustomed to ordering products as late as December 20th and having them delivered before Christmas. That is not likely to happen this year.\u201d One Amazon merchant said Amazon typically packs and ships almost all of his orders. But over the weekend, he was required to ship two types of product himself, including a power tool, even though Amazon had the merchandise in its warehouses. Another seller in Wisconsin, who sells flasks and tumblers, said he had to ship orders to customers in Michigan, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Georgia over the past few days. The two sellers spoke on condition of anonymity out of fear of retribution from Amazon. \u201cThere\u2019s no rhyme or reason to the geography of the customer,\u201d the Wisconsin merchant said. \u201cIf Amazon has any weaknesses, this weekend will show them more than any other.\u201d Online shoppers have come roaring back after an Election Day lull. Spending from Nov. 21 to Nov. 23 surged 49%, according to Adobe, putting a strain on delivery capacity. In recent weeks, Amazon\u2019s marketing team has been exhorting customers to shop early in an effort to prevent a deluge of orders from overwhelming the company\u2019s delivery operations. Chad Rubin, whose software company Skubana helps merchants sell products on multiple platforms, said Amazon shifting sales outside of its own network has a positive side. Too many Amazon merchants were too dependent on the company, he said, and were caught flat-footed in the early days of the pandemic when Amazon delayed delivery of their products. That prompted many merchants to develop their own delivery capacity, which will help Amazon get through the first pandemic holiday, he said. \u201dAmazon is going to be just fine,\u201d he said. \u201cTheir biggest merchants can let Amazon handle delivery or do it themselves, so it\u2019s diversified. Not everything will arrive in two days. That\u2019s the only downside.\u201d Shoppers will tolerate delivery delays over the Thanksgiving weekend, which will give Amazon flexibility, but the pressure will intensify in the week before Christmas when other delivery carriers like FedEx Corp. and United Parcel Service Inc. no longer guarantee delivery by Dec. 25, said James Thomson, a former Amazonian who helps merchants sell products on the site through his consulting firm Buy Box Experts. \u201cWe expect sales to be insane December 15 to 24,\u201d Thomson said, adding that customers will flock to Amazon because they\u2019ve come to see it as the online retailer that can reliably ensure delivery in time for Christmas. \u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P."

    "article_text":"Mastercard\u2019s latest study shows that consumers are shopping more consciously this holiday season. Mastercard senior advisor and former Saks chairman and CEO Steve Sadove joins Yahoo Finance Live to weigh in on why U.S. holiday retail sales are expected to grow more this winter than last year. [MUSIC PLAYING] AKIKO FUJITA: Retailers are bracing for a holiday shopping season unlike any other. Sales are expected to grow about 2.4%, that's at least according to Mastercard. They're out with a new survey pointing to a shift in where consumers are likely to shop throughout the holidays, it's all about shopping supporting local and small businesses. Let's bring in Steve Sadove. He is Mastercard Senior Advisor and former Saks Chairman and CEO. Steve, it's good to talk to you, certainly great to get your insight on a really busy week for retailers. Let's start with big picture here first because we've been talking to a number of guests who've said look, it's not about Black Friday and Cyber Monday anymore, it's about all of October and all of November as retailers started their discounts early to try and get those shoppers spending again. STEVE SADOVE: Absolutely, it's an early, longer season. It's a, I think it's a little bit less promotional season than we've seen in the past but it's all about letting the consumer feel safe, letting the consumer feel like that they are in an environment where they're going to be wanting to shop in. And you saw it early on the, whether it was the Amazon Prime Day, you saw the other retailers starting in early October. And the consumer's been responding. The sales in October and through the middle of December I mean, November as measured by the Mastercard SpendingPulse data is showing that the consumers retail growth is in the 4% or 5% growth range. So the consumer's out there shopping. Clearly shopping differently than they have in the past but the retail sales are there. AKIKO FUJITA: What we've seen over the course of this pandemic is that retailers or consumers increasingly want everything online and they want it right away and yet that seems to run counter to what you found in your survey, which is that even in spite of all of that, there are consumers who are increasingly going to look to shop local, help a lot of the small businesses that have been especially hit hard as the result of all of these health restrictions. STEVE SADOVE: Yes, the Mastercard SpendingPulse survey data is saying the consumer wants to stay close to home. They see that the local retailers have been suffering, so they want to support them. On the other hand, if you look at the data, they're also supporting the big box retailers where it's all in one shopping, they're able to feel safe and the numbers coming out of the big box retailers for the third quarter are extremely strong. So it's a combination of wanting to support local brands, wanting to be socially responsible. Attitudinally the consumer feels the pain that these small retailers are feeling but they also are out there shopping in the big boxes as well. DAN ROBERTS: Steve, Dan Roberts here. If we zoom out a little bit and look beyond the holiday shopping season, let's look at after the pandemic, whenever that might be, whenever it might be behind us. One of the fascinating questions has been whether these retail trends will continue the way they've been or whether it will change a little bit back to before the pandemic. And specifically with e-commerce, I mean, so many physical chains have seen huge surges, Walmart, Target, Best Buy, Urban Outfitters, just huge, huge numbers here and I know that e-commerce's share of overall US retail spending has accelerated dramatically during the pandemic. So what do you see happening afterward? Especially with trends like curbside pickup taking off, are a lot of people just going to decide that this is their new normal and even once the pandemic is gone maybe they see no reason anymore to go shop in person at a physical store? STEVE SADOVE: Yeah, I think there's no question that we've seen, whether it's eight years of change in eight months or six years of change in six months, what's happened is that the underlying trends towards digitization have accelerated, they're going to continue to accelerate, they'll go off of this base to a higher level. What I'm seeing is the consumer wants product anywhere, any time that they want to get it and what's convenient for them. Now they know how to do curbside pickup, they're going to continue to want to do that. But remember, when you say that 20% of commerce is online, that means that 80% of commerce is still in a physical store. So we can't look at this as being online only. It's omnichannel, you have to have a single view of the customer, you've got to be able to do the buy online, pickup curbside or in the store. None of that's going to go away. Having said that, as soon as we feel comfortable with the vaccines, you're going to see behavior of people going back into the stores. It's going to be different. The DTC brands for direct to consumer brands are going to be opening up more stores because of the interplay between people wanting to shop online or in a physical store. All these trends are going to be accelerated. The trends of the winners that were winning beforehand and the losers that were losing, that trend is going to continue and be accelerated but there's no question that these trends, the digitization trends are going to be an everyday part of our lives. AKIKO FUJITA: Steve, how do you think these big department stores are looking at their physical footprint right now? You look at a name like Macy's for example, they've obviously had a number of store closures already but more recently, they've sort of experimented using their dark stores as fulfillment centers. Is that where some of these stores that have already closed, is that a better use for them at a time when there is a lot of questions about how the malls pivot, how do these unused spaces become best utilized. Is Macy's tapping into something you think a lot of department stores are looking at now? STEVE SADOVE: Well, you've seen a consolidation in the department store sector for years and there's going to continue to be a fallout and you've seen a number of bankruptcies not just in department stores but in other apparel stores that have accelerated because of the pandemic. Right now you have probably a third too many malls in the United States. So a number of the C and D, meaning the less productive malls, over the next several years will go under. Some of them may become distribution centers, some of them may become educational, health care. I think that this mixed use of malls, whether it's going to be for work, live, play, that's all going to become a part of the future. So you're going to have a repurposing. You don't need as many stores as you have in the United States. If 20% or more is going to be digital, you're going to need less of a physical footprint, you're going to have to have a resetting of rents in the United States. That's going to occur over time but it's going to be a smarter retail. It's going to be more integrated with the digital experience. But I think that the A malls, meaning the high end productive malls will continue to thrive. You're going to see them be different kinds of experiences. You're going to have to now think about how do you create that experience, how do you train associates to give them the analytical tools that the consumer is going to want to have to be able to have that seamless experience. The skill sets that a lot of the department store retailers or other retailers, they're merchants, they don't have some of these analytical skills. That's where, whether it's a Mastercard or others are bringing to them a lot of the analytics, the segmentation, the data, a personalization, that's all going to be a part of how these department stores evolve because the traditional buy other people's product, pile it high, sell it to the consumer, that's not the name of the game anymore. It's really understanding that consumer and sorting a store very differently than they have in the past. AKIKO FUJITA: Yeah, no question that data even more important, especially in such an environment that's changing rapidly. Steve Sadove, Senior Advisor at Mastercard, good to talk to you. STEVE SADOVE: Good to talk to you."

More than half that used to shop through traditional channels including in stores are shopping online. They\u2019re doing a lot of brand surfing. There\u2019s a lot of exploration online,\u201d said Zegras. The steepest discounts for toys and furniture are expected on Sunday \u2014 the day before Cyber Monday. While more tech and electronics deals will be offered on Black Friday, according to Adobe Analytics. Some of the most anticipated deals gifts include Star Wars toys and LEGO sets, Rainbocorns, Cutetitos, and Little Live Pets The cheapest shipping options are expected on Cyber Monday. About 64% of shoppers say they\u2019re not going to pay for expedited shipping this year. It\u2019s expected that shipments will increase as shoppers send their gifts to friends and family rather than visit them in person. Those extra packages though may put a strain on deliveries which could see some delays if shoppers hold off ordering past Cyber Monday. \u201cGet your shopping done as soon as you possibly can,\u201d said Zegras. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean that if you order in the middle of December your package won\u2019t arrive; you\u2019re just taking more and more risk the close you get of the middle of December.\u201d"

    "article_text":"Returns as of 11\/28\/2020 Returns as of 11\/28\/2020 Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Alibaba owns the largest online marketplaces in China, and Alibaba Cloud is the\u00a0country's leading cloud platform. Amazon is the e-commerce leader in the U.S., Europe, and other markets, and it owns\u00a0AWS (Amazon Web Services), the largest cloud platform in the world. Image source: Getty Images. Alibaba went public six years ago, and its stock has risen nearly 300% from its IPO price. But Amazon's stock surged more than 830% during the same period. Let's see why Amazon attracted more bulls than Alibaba, and whether or not that trend will continue. Amazon generates most of its revenue from its online marketplaces, which include a mix of its own offerings and products from third-party sellers, but it generates most of its profits from AWS. AWS' higher-margin revenue enables Amazon to expand its e-commerce business with lower-margin strategies, including discounts, free shipping options, cheap hardware, and digital perks for Prime subscribers. It also supports the ongoing expansion of the company's brick-and-mortar stores. Alibaba, which also generates most of it revenue from its online marketplaces, doesn't take on any inventories. Its top Chinese marketplaces, Taobao and Tmall, are paid listing platforms that link buyers to sellers, and its logistics unit Cainiao fulfills those orders. This less capital-intensive approach keeps Alibaba's core commerce business profitable. However, its other three businesses -- Alibaba Cloud, the Digital Media and Entertainment unit, and the Innovation Initiatives unit -- are not. Therefore, Alibaba subsidizes the growth of these unprofitable segments with the core commerce segment's profits. Amazon's revenue and earnings rose\u00a020% and 14%, respectively, in 2019. But in the first nine months of 2020, Amazon's revenue rose 35% year-over-year as\u00a0its earnings surged 68%. AWS' revenue rose 30% to $32.6 billion, or 13% of Amazon's top line, during those nine months. The cloud unit's operating profit jumped 51% to $10 billion, or 62% of its operating income -- and its operating margin expanded year-over-year from 26.3% to 30.5%. Amazon's North American unit's operating margin contracted year-over-year during the first nine months, mainly due to higher COVID-19 safety expenses and fulfillment costs, but its international business finally generated a slim operating profit after years of operating losses. Analysts expect Amazon's revenue and earnings to rise 35% and 52%, respectively, this year. Next year, they expect its revenue and earnings to rise 18% and 30%, respectively, as the pandemic passes. Alibaba's revenue rose 35% in fiscal 2020, which ended on\u00a0March 31, and its adjusted earnings rose 38% (which exclude its acquisition of a 33% stake in its fintech affiliate Ant Group and other one-time gains and losses). Image source: Alibaba. In the first half of fiscal 2021, Alibaba's revenue grew\u00a032% year-over-year as its adjusted earnings rose 28%. Unlike Amazon, Alibaba didn't experience a huge uptick in pandemic-induced sales, for two reasons. First, Alibaba faces more online competitors in China, including JD.com and Pinduoduo, than Amazon faces in its other top markets. Second, China largely contained the pandemic by April, which limited its overall impact on online sales. Analysts expect Alibaba's revenue and earnings to rise 47% and 36% this year, respectively, as its growth improves in the second half. Next year, its revenue and earnings are expected to grow 31% and 21%, respectively. Investors are paying a premium for Amazon's stock because its e-commerce and cloud businesses have been growing like weeds throughout the pandemic. Meanwhile, Alibaba's valuation seems depressed by the Ant Group debacle and new regulatory threats in both China and the U.S. I personally own Amazon instead of Alibaba, but I think Alibaba's long-term growth potential and valuation make it a better buy right now. Alibaba's stock will remain volatile, but it's still China's top e-commerce and cloud company -- and its stock is far too cheap relative to its earnings growth.

    "url":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/ibm-planning-10-000-job-122551465.html",
    "article_text":"(Bloomberg) -- International Business Machines Corp. is planning to cut about 10,000 jobs in Europe in an attempt to lower costs at its slow-growth services unit and prepare the business for a spinoff. The wide-ranging losses will affect about 20% of staff in the region, according to people familiar with the matter. The U.K. and Germany are set to be most impacted, with cuts also planned in Poland, Slovakia, Italy and Belgium. IBM announced the job cuts in Europe earlier in November during a meeting with European labor representatives, according to a union officer briefed on proceedings. The person asked not to be identified because the talks are private. IBM shares fell 1.6% at 9:37 a.m. in New York. They\u2019ve declined 8.6% this year. \u201cOur staffing decisions are made to provide the best support to our customers in adopting an open hybrid cloud platform and AI capabilities,\u201d an IBM spokeswoman said in an emailed statement. \u201cWe also continue to make significant investments in training and skills development for IBMers to best meet the needs of our customers.\u201d Hardest hit will be IBM\u2019s legacy IT services business, which handles day-to-day infrastructure operations, such as managing client data centers and traditional information-technology support for installing, operating and repairing equipment. IBM said in October it\u2019s planning to spin off the business and focus on its new hybrid-cloud computing and artificial intelligence unit, which the company hopes will return it to revenue growth. IBM said it aims to complete the carve-out as a tax-free spinoff to IBM shareholders by the end of 2021. \u201cWe\u2019re taking structural actions to simplify and streamline our business,\u201d said IBM Chief Financial Officer James Kavanaugh during the company\u2019s third-quarter earnings call in October. \u201cWe expect the fourth-quarter charge to our operating results of about $2.3 billion.\u201d Once an iconic blue-chip company, IBM\u2019s star has faded over the years as its legacy in mainframe computing and IT services fell behind while newer technology firms like Amazon.com Inc. swooped in to dominate the emerging cloud-computing market. IBM was already cutting jobs earlier this year, although the company wouldn\u2019t say how many positions were being eliminated. The company has traditionally declined to disclose the numbers of job cuts for decades, with arguably one exception in 1993 when Lou Gerstner, a CEO hired from outside the company, announced 60,000 dismissals. The spin-off of its services unit is the first big move by Chief Executive Officer Arvind Krishna, who took over from Ginni Rometty in April and has been pushing to revive growth after almost a decade of shrinking revenue. Krishna earlier this year cut thousands of jobs as he began reshaping the business. The current round of job cuts should be completed by the end of the first-half of 2021, one of the people added.

    "article_text":"Considering the COVID-19 pandemic is still wreaking havoc on the financial statements of Corporate America, Lores\u2019 position at HP is not a bad one to be in right now even if things aren\u2019t 100% perfect at the computing giant. \u201cI think we are showing good performance across many businesses of the company. And clearly the pandemic has reinforced the businesses that we have on the consumer side and help us in that direction,\u201d Lores told Yahoo Finance Live in the wake of a 10 cent fourth fiscal quarter earnings beat Tuesday evening. \u201cAt the same time, we continue to make progress executing all of our strategies, whether it is to advance the leadership that we have in PCs and print to create new categories, but also to transform the company and become more efficient,\u201d said Lores. \u201cSo we will look at the impact that all of those things are having as what is behind the success and the progress we are making, as reflected in our results.\u201d Here are HP\u2019s fourth fiscal quarter results, compared to Bloomberg estimates: Total Revenue: $15.3 billion (sales fell 1% from same time a year ago) vs. $14.69 billion Non-GAAP EPS: 62 cents vs. 52 cents First Fiscal Quarter EPS Guidance: 64 cents a share to 70 cents vs. 54 cents Sales at HP\u2019s personal systems and printing segments were unchanged and fell 3%, respectively, from the prior year. Sales growth was notched inside the consumer segments of each division, reflecting consumers buying notebook computers and printers to work from home. Commercial sales dropped as workers have migrated from offices where large printers and desktops reign supreme \u2014 hence less desire by businesses to buy new hardware. Operating profits at HP\u2019s personal systems segment fell slightly on a sequential basis, but rose 260 basis points at the printer business. Lores told Yahoo Finance the printer business bottomed in the third fiscal quarter. The Street very often has a lot to weigh on HP. The company isn\u2019t exactly a high growth tech juggernaut like any one of the FAANG stocks. But, Lores continues to gain high marks on the Street for his management of the business during the pandemic \u2014 which includes a very watchful eye on expenses and a push to innovate in both the printer and computing sides of the businesses. HP has frankly just done good amidst the pandemic to build goodwill among households, moving quickly to support the computing needs of students. And now with expense tailwinds at his back supporting margins, Lores looks ready to become even more aggressive on the cash deployment front to drive a higher stock price. \u201cIf I look at what we did in the third quarter and fourth quarter combined, we bought back close to 10% of the outstanding shares of the company. I would say this is a fairly remarkable number,\u201d Lores told Yahoo Finance. \u201cAnd we have also announced that going forward, we are going to buy at least $1 billion of shares per quarter. And we also have announced that we are going to be increasing our dividend by 10% in 2021. So we remain fully committed to returning capital to shareholders. We have done that during the last two quarters, and we will continue to do that in the coming quarters.\u201d Again, not a bad position to be in for Lores and his shareholders.

Amazon is a great option for growth investors, and Enbridge is a reliable income stock. But the real beauty is how Amazon's growth prospects and massive spending complement Enbridge's stable and stodgy FCF generation and dividend distribution. Here's why each company is a great buy now. Image source: Getty Images. It rarely happens, but Amazon stock has indeed gone on sale. Shares of the e-commerce and cloud computing service management company are down over 5% in the past three months compared to the market's nearly 5% gain. Amazon is now earning record net income, despite spending more and more money as it continues to invest in everything from content creation for Amazon Prime members to data centers for Amazon Web Services, and more. But Amazon is a different company than it was three years ago. It has proved that it can earn more profit without compromising its growth potential. This incredible balance, along with the fact that Amazon is the undisputed e-commerce leader and rivals Microsoft Azure in cloud computing services, is a great reason to pick up shares of Amazon right now. If you don't have $3,100 lying around to buy a share of Amazon, you are not alone. There are plenty of brokers that now offer what are called fractional shares. TD Ameritrade, Charles Schwab, Interactive Brokers, Fidelity, and Robinhood all offer ways to buy a fraction of a share of high nominally priced stocks like Amazon. With Fidelity, for example, a user could invest $100 into amazon and buy 1\/31 of a share. Like other oil and gas companies, one of the long-term headwinds facing Enbridge is a gradual decline in oil and natural gas consumption. If proven true, this would naturally devalue Enbridge's existing infrastructure assets. It's a risk to be taken seriously, but given the company's reduced price, strong performance, and cash cushion, Enbridge looks to be a great dividend stock to buy now. Amazon and Enbridge have virtually nothing in common, but each could serve a purpose in your portfolio. Investors who want access to more growth could go with Amazon. And investors who want to generate income could go with Enbridge. If you're just starting out, adding both names could be a good decision too. And whether you're investing $100 or $1,000, many brokers will let you buy fractional shares so you can participate in previously inaccessible stocks like Amazon.

    "article_text":"Returns as of 11\/28\/2020 Returns as of 11\/28\/2020 Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Image source: Getty Images. Amazon's expansion is often cited as a root cause of the retail apocalypse, and it continues to benefit from closures of brick-and-mortar stores. It could account for nearly 40% of all U.S. e-commerce sales next year, according to eMarketer, which makes it the undisputed king of online retail. The firm also estimates e-commerce sales will account for 14.4% of all U.S. retail sales in 2021, and that percentage could rise to 18.1% by 2024. That upward slope indicates Amazon, which ended last year with 150 million paid Prime members worldwide, still has\u00a0room to grow. AWS' higher-margin revenue continues to subsidize the growth of Amazon's lower-margin marketplaces, which enable it to consistently widen its moat with aggressive discounts and ecosystem-expanding strategies. As a result, Amazon's revenue rose 35% year over year in the first nine months of 2020 as its earnings surged 68%. Wall Street expects its revenue and earnings to rise 35% and\u00a052%, respectively, for the full year. Amazon's stock is still reasonably valued at 58 times forward earnings, and the so-called \"Death Star\" of retail will crush more brick-and-mortar retailers in the near future. Back in\u00a02012, Best Buy seemed fully exposed to the retail apocalypse. Shoppers were using its stores as \"showrooms\" to test out products they would later purchase on Amazon, its sales were declining, and its CEO Brian Dunn abruptly resigned due to an inappropriate relationship with an employee. But Dunn's successor, Hubert Joly, turned around the retailer by fixing broken inventory systems, investing in better employee training, matching Amazon's prices, and embracing its reputation as a showroom by renting out its floor space to top brands like Apple. It also expanded its e-commerce platform and turned its network of brick-and-mortar stores info fulfillment centers for online orders. Under Joly's seven-year tenure, which ended last June, Best Buy's stock rallied 260% as it won back shoppers. Joly's successor, Corie Barry, stuck to that playbook to help Best Buy weather the pandemic. Barry kept Best Buy's stores open, kept its e-commerce and delivery systems running, and made sure it was stocked with enough PCs and accessories to keep pace with the shift toward remote work and online learning. As a result, Best Buy's domestic digital comps surged by triple-digit percentages in the first half of the year. Its total revenue dipped 1% year over year due to store closures in the first quarter, but analysts expect its revenue and earnings to grow 5% and 19%, respectively, this year as its sales accelerate through the busy holiday season. In addition to being a retail apocalypse-proof stock, Best Buy still looks cheap at 18 times forward earnings, and it pays a decent forward dividend yield of 1.9%. Image source: Target. But Cornell gradually turned around Target by renovating the retailer's aging stores, launching smaller-format stores for urban areas, and introducing dozens of private-label brands to expand its margins and differentiate the chain from the competition. Target expanded its e-commerce ecosystem with more delivery and pick-up options and turned its brick-and-mortar stores into fulfillment centers for those online orders. It matched Amazon and Walmart's prices and locked in shoppers with its new Target Circle loyalty program. It also continued to expand its store count every year even as other retailers closed down. As a result, 75% of the U.S. population now lives within 10 miles of a Target store. Target's improved scale enabled it to gain a lot of shoppers during the pandemic. Its total revenue rose 19% year over year in the first nine months of 2020, with triple-digit digital comps growth in the second and third quarters, and its earnings per share rose 25%. Analysts expect Target's revenue and earnings to rise by 18% and 42%, respectively, this year. Target's growth should decelerate next year if the pandemic ends, but it's still reasonably priced at 22 times forward earnings. Moreover, Target pays a forward dividend yield of 1.6%, and it's raised its payout annually for 49 straight years -- which will make it a Dividend King if it hikes its dividend again next year.

    "url":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/video\/colin-kaepernick-not-play-nfl-133901017.html",
    "article_text":"In this episode of Influencers, Andy Serwer speaks with former NFL player and 'Uncomfortable Conversations with a Black Man' author, Emmanuel Acho, about Colin Kaepernick's future in football and what NFL owners can do to address racial tension within the league. ANDY SERWER: When you had Roger Goodell on, Emmanuel-- I think it was in August-- he offered an apology to Colin Kaepernick. But Colin Kaepernick still has not been signed by a team. Is this collusion? Do you think he'll ever go back to the NFL? EMMANUEL ACHO: No, I don't think Colin Kaepernick will play in the NFL, but there are so many variables to this. What do I mean by that? In the NFL, every organization runs a cost-benefit analysis. How much will it cost us to have you on organization, and how much will you benefit us? So if you're an NFL organization, especially four years removed, in regards to Colin Kaepernick, now you're weighing the risk-reward. He'll come in, and obviously, he'll be anywhere from a second- to a third-string quarterback right now. Is having Colin Kaepernick as a second- or third-string quarterback worth the questions that every player will now get asked, that we will now get asked, and is it worth the distraction that the media will create? Not Colin Kaepernick, necessarily, but the media will create. So, because of that, I don't think that Colin Kaepernick would get signed. I also think that-- I don't know-- sometimes there's an impasse. Remember. Let's talk Cam Newton for a second. Cam Newton didn't want to be a backup quarterback. He wanted to be a starter. And as a result, there was only one team that wanted to make him a starter. Eric Reid, someone who has been proudly known to be standing by Colin Kaepernick, very justifiably so-- the Washington Football Team-- they offered him a place on their practice squad. Eric Reid turned it down because Eric Reid views himself as a starter. And so, just because you want to play doesn't necessarily mean that the position will be offered to you that you do, in fact, want. So, because of all the nuances regarding that, I personally don't see Colin Kaepernick playing in the NFL. - So it was the situation where the owners didn't want him for a while, and now Father Time has entered into the equation as well a little bit, perhaps, too. EMMANUEL ACHO: I would say it's a combination of everything. The owners don't want what the media will bring with that, number one. And number two-- it's so detailed, and it's so multifaceted, but until the owners can also get their fans to understand it wasn't about disrespecting the flag-- it was about a just cause-- then the owners, who were always worried about bottom line, who were always worried about their dollars, now are gonna run the risk of losing their dollars for the sake of Colin Kaepernick. And unfortunately, owners just aren't that selfless. You don't become a billionaire by being selfless. That's not how it works. - And as you were saying, too, Emmanuel-- different cities, different owners, different politics. It's all part of that equation, as you said. You mentioned the 32 owners. Only two of them are people of color, and only three non-interim head coaches are black. Wow. Seems like there's a long way to go there, too, right? EMMANUEL ACHO: Yeah, but the issue, Andy, is that so many people think the NFL is a meritocracy. However hard you work, you'll earn your success. It's not. It's really based off nepotism and cronyism. Nepotism, you hire your family, and cronyism, you hire your friends. Historically, if the NFL was founded by white men, white men are hiring their family-- nepotism-- white men. They're hiring their friends-- cronyism-- white men. So how do you think that the NFL will change if it's historically founded by white men who are looking out for other white men? It won't. And so, that's why it's not a coincidence when you see only 3 out of 32 coaches, full-time, who began the season, or whatever the statistic may be, are black. That's not a coincidence. That's just the way in which our world at large works, and the NFL is a reflection of that."

    "article_text":"  The French government has sent notices to multinational internet companies that they should pay the country\u2019s digital tax in December, a finance ministry spokesman said on Wednesday. The government canceled a few weeks ago its earlier decision to suspend the collection of the controversial levy. The outlook: The Trump administration may now choose to go ahead with the tariffs in its last two months in power, but whatever it decides or not, the situation will have to be dealt with by incoming president Joe Biden and his team.  The clear hope of European governments is that the U.S. will rejoin the OECD talks, so that an international agreement on global tax can be struck next year. This should not be too difficult: Even the companies targeted by the measure have indicated their preference for a global tax, which would spare them the compliance costs of having to deal with many different national ones.  The OECD talks had made serious progress on the technical level and were seen to be nearing a positive conclusion. With the coronavirus recession and governments strapped for cash, tax avoidance on the level used by big multinationals has become politically indefensible. A deal shouldn\u2019t be too hard to find next year, making the current Franco-American skirmish obsolete."

And importantly for investors, Disney has been able to increase prices at its parks at double the rate of inflation over the last five years. It may even be able to increase prices at a slightly higher rate in the near term because of pent-up demand following attendance restrictions. At various points during the previous 50-year stretch, there were major stock market crashes that may tempt some individuals to sell out of fear of losing even more. At the other end of the spectrum, some may have been tempted to cash out after large gains.

However, it has seen a massive surge in sales amid the pandemic. This was again confirmed upon the release of the company's third-quarter earnings. Due to its dramatically improved financials, the stock has finally made itself worthy of investor consideration. Admittedly, BJ's stock has not looked appealing in the recent past. Although founded at about the same time as Costco, BJ's has not seen as much growth as its West Coast-based peer. Costco covers nearly every U.S. state and operates warehouses on four continents. BJ's has remained primarily on the East Coast, so few people west of the Mississippi have likely set foot in a BJ's warehouse. Before the pandemic, it was a retailer struggling with meager sales growth, weak cash flows, and massive debt. Consequently, its stock attracted little interest. After the company launched its second IPO in 2018, it traded in a range until early 2020. Interestingly, COVID-19 could become the best thing that ever happened to BJ's Wholesale. Thanks to the pandemic, this once-stagnant stock has broken out of its range. Although the stock has plateaued in recent weeks, the surge from the March lows has led to stock growth of about 90% since the beginning of the year. Improved profitability made these higher cash flows possible. In the most recent quarter, adjusted earnings per share of $0.92 per share amounted to a 124% increase from year-ago levels. A 19% increase in comparable club sales (excluding gasoline) and a 200% surge in digitally enabled sales fueled this profit increase. The balance sheet also experienced a dramatic improvement in one key area. Long-term debt fell by more than $350 million from last quarter alone to about $845 million. This will go a long way toward stabilizing the company's balance sheet. Image source: Getty Images. Additionally, if earnings forecasts prove accurate, these increases should continue. Analysts forecast 93% profit growth for the current year. Although they foresee a 10% pullback next year, the company appears positioned to hold on to most of its sales gains. Moreover, it appears the stock price has not fully reflected the gains in net income. Even after surging in the late spring and summer, BJ's still trades at a significant discount to its peers. At a forward P\/E ratio of about 17, it comes in lower than Costco, Walmart, and Amazon. Furthermore, BJ's operates in 16 states and has expanded into Ohio and Michigan in recent years. Management has made expanding its footprint one of its priorities. This could point to a strategy in which this regional retailer eventually goes national, and perhaps someday, opens warehouses outside of the U.S. Stock Advisor launched in February of 2002.

    "url":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/amazon-launches-ip-accelerator-europe-113600089.html",
    "article_text":"IP Accelerator connects businesses with a network of trusted IP law firms who will charge pre-negotiated fees Participating small businesses can access Amazon\u2019s brand protection tools months before their trademark registration is issued Today, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) launched Intellectual Property Accelerator (IP Accelerator) in France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Netherlands and the United Kingdom, making it easier and more cost effective for small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) to obtain trademarks, protect their brands and tackle counterfeit goods. IP Accelerator, which is available to any brand selling in Amazon\u2019s stores, connects entrepreneurs directly with a curated network of European law firms with expertise in IP rights. Participating law firms will charge fees to SMBs at competitive, pre-negotiated rates, giving sellers confidence and clarity about how much obtaining a trademark will cost them. In addition, SMBs can also seek general IP advice from these law firms as their brands and businesses grow. Amazon launched IP Accelerator specifically with small business owners in mind. Larger businesses are four times more likely than SMBs to register their Intellectual Property (IP) rights1. The main reason small business entrepreneurs do not protect their rights is because of a lack of knowledge about IP and not knowing where to turn2. The process can be complicated, particularly for entrepreneurs in the early stages of setting up a business, and Amazon wanted to provide low cost assistance to all European SMBs, including the over 150,000 European-based SMBs selling on Amazon. Selling partners continue to account for more than 50% of products Amazon sells in its online stores. IP rights are vital for businesses wanting to stop unauthorized parties from using their brands or copying their ideas. Owning IP can also create new sources of revenue should entrepreneurs wish to license their goods or services to third parties. Businesses using IP Accelerator will also get access to Amazon\u2019s wider brand protection services months or even years before their trademark registration is officially issued. Amazon\u2019s Brand Registry provides SMBs with powerful tools that help them manage and protect their brand and IP rights in Amazon stores. Brand Registry is a free service and more than 350,000 brands are already enrolled. Participants benefit from Amazon\u2019s automated protections that use information about brands to proactively remove suspected infringing or inaccurate content. Brands are also able to find and report suspected infringement through more powerful tools and can gain greater influence over product information displayed on Amazon\u2019s product detail pages so customers can make confident, informed purchasing decisions on Amazon. Francois Saugier, Vice President for EU Seller Services, Amazon, said: \"We know from our conversations with small business owners that there is often confusion about why IP rights are important and how sellers can secure them. As part of our broader commitment to supporting small businesses, we have set up IP Accelerator to make the IP registration process as easy and as affordable as possible for entrepreneurs in the early days of their businesses.\" Pippa Hall, Director of Innovation and Chief Economist, from the UK\u2019s Intellectual Property Office, said: \"Great ideas are the core of every good business. Turning those ideas into a reality relies on IP. Understanding, protecting and getting the most out of your IP is a crucial ingredient of success. A good IP strategy should sit at the heart of every good business plan.\"  Amazon has selected participating IP law firms based on their experience, expertise, and customer service. They will support SMBs with all aspects of the trademark filing process, such as researching a brand to see if anyone else is already using it and providing tailored advice on trademark applications. Over one hundred trademark experts across Europe have signed up to the program. Tilman Vossius, of Barkhoff, Reimann Vossius, Germany, said: \"The IP Accelerator Programme is the first worldwide programme to provide rapid trademarking registration for small and medium-sized businesses. Amazon has helped SMBs by selecting respected IP firms across Europe and negotiating extremely good prices for them.\" Jos\u00e9 Ignacio San Mart\u00edn, Associate Partner, Elzaburu, Spain, said: \"The trademark is probably the most important intangible asset for a company. It allows a company\u2019s products to be identified and differentiated from those of the competition. Amazon\u2019s IP Accelerator is to be welcomed because it will mean more businesses will register their trademarks and also allows them to access all the benefits of Amazon\u2019s Brand Registry.\" Julius Stobbs, Founder, Stobbs IP, UK, said: \"We are excited to be involved in this programme. It is great that Amazon is placing such an emphasis on IP protection and respecting the rights of brand owners. IP Accelerator elevates the importance of IP and pushes smaller companies to do the right thing: obtaining and respecting IP rights.\" IP Accelerator was launched in the United States in 2019. Since the launch, Amazon has connected SMBs with participating IP law firms, resulting in 6,000 trademark applications submitted to the US Patent and Trademark Office. Dewar Gaines, Owner and Operator of premium pet products business Gaines Family Farmstead, used IP Accelerator in 2019 to register his trademark, and can testify how European small firms can also benefit from the programme. Mr Gaines said: \"As with any quickly growing business, there is always risk of people copying or stealing your hard work and capitalizing on your growth. As a result of filing our trademark through IP Accelerator, I am more confident than ever that our brand is secure, leaving me and my team more time to concentrate on providing awesome products to our incredible customers.\" Contacts"

    "article_text":"(Bloomberg) -- A battle between Amazon.com Inc. and Reliance Industries Ltd. to dominate India\u2019s $1 trillion consumer market is stoking nationalist rhetoric in a courtroom and outside, as the two companies tussle over the future of a distressed local retailer. At the center of the case is Amazon\u2019s efforts to block Reliance\u2019s planned purchase of Future Group\u2019s assets, saying the Indian retailer violated a contract by agreeing to a sale to a rival controlled by billionaire Mukesh Ambani. The Delhi High Court is now weighing if the U.S. e-commerce giant has any legal basis to object to the transaction and a ruling is expected in weeks. The legal spat has not only revealed the intensity of the fight between two of the world\u2019s richest men -- Jeff Bezos and Ambani -- but has also sparked a \u201cforeign versus local\u201d debate. A lawyer for Future, in his argument, painted Amazon as the \u201cBig Brother in America\u201d out to crush a small local company, while a retailer lobby group declared its \u201csupport to Indian company Future Group in its fight against Foreign Amazon.\u201d For its part, Amazon wants Indian courts and regulators to enforce a business contract in what it views as a commercial dispute. If Future is allowed to renege on its contract with Amazon, it may signal to global investors that investments in India are risky, the U.S. company alleges. That is an inconvenient image at a time when Prime Minister Narendra Modi needs foreign investment to create jobs and reboot an economy pummeled by the pandemic. The stakes are high for both Amazon and Reliance. Securing Future\u2019s assets will give Reliance, already India\u2019s biggest retailer, an unparalleled edge in a market where most of the consumers still prefer shopping in stores. That\u2019s an advantage Amazon is not willing to cede. Nor is Amazon willing to be upstaged by nationalistic arguments after losing ground to home-grown rivals in China. India, with its billion-plus consumers, is effectively the last big growth frontier. \u201dIt\u2019s not a surprise that this fight\u2019s taken an India versus foreigner turn. That talks to the broader sentiment Make in India, Buy Indian that prevails,\u201d said Sanchit Vir Gogia, founder and chief executive officer of Singapore-based advisory, Greyhound Research. \u201cAmazon has put billions in India and it\u2019s fair to expect they\u2019ll do everything to protect their investment.\u201d Ambani, 63, has been playing the nationalist card as well. The tycoon, who\u2019s been warning against data colonization since 2018, often presents Reliance as a homegrown champion and its telecommunications, retail and digital ventures as nation-building initiatives. Vocal for Local This week, Reliance Retail introduced the \u201cIndie\u201d and \u201cSwadesh\u201d -- meaning from one\u2019s own country -- taglines on its e-commerce websites to promote indigenous handicrafts and textiles, dovetailing with Modi\u2019s call to be \u201cVocal for Local.\u201d In a key May speech, Modi mentioned \u201cself-reliance\u201d at least 17 times during a 33-minute address to the nation. In August, Reliance announced the $3.4 billion purchase of the indebted Future Group that was straining under a severe cash crunch triggered by the coronavirus-led slump. Amazon, which holds a 49% stake in an unlisted Future Group entity, objected to this transaction and secured an order from a Singapore arbitration court that temporarily put the asset sale on hold. Future petitioned against this freeze-order in the Delhi High Court. Supporting Future, the Confederation of All India Traders said in a statement Nov. 20 that Amazon is seeking \u201cillegal control\u201d of the retailer. East India Co. Harish Salve, the celebrity lawyer representing listed Future Retail Ltd., told the court that Amazon was behaving \u201clike the East India Company of the 21st century.\u201d Amazon\u2019s stand is \u201ceither you do business with me or you shut down,\u201d he said, stressing that an aborted asset sale deal will lead to thousands of job losses and bankruptcy. The East India Company -- formed by a group of British merchants who arrived in India in the 17th century to trade in spices and ended up colonizing the country for centuries -- has been an unpleasant memory in Indian history. This emotive reference marks the latest Indian versus outsider dispute this year that also saw Google face pushback from Indian startups and over 200 apps from Chinese technology companies being banned following a military clash along the Indo-China border. \u201cAmazon has no investment in Future Retail,\u201d Salve said in court. \u201cReliance wants to buy, but I have to ask Big Brother in America?\u201d he said, asking if an overseas firm should be allowed to control an Indian company\u2019s business dealings. $6.5 Billion Gopal Subramanium, Amazon\u2019s lawyer and India\u2019s former solicitor general, countered that the American e-tailer was no Big Brother or East India Company and had in fact introduced Future Retail to a prospective investor to ease its distress. Amazon has created thousands of jobs and invested $6.5 billion in India so far, he said. Reliance\u2019s lawyer has argued that the Singapore arbitration tribunal\u2019s emergency order halting the transaction isn\u2019t recognized by Indian law and the deal is crucial to save the retailer from collapse. These arguments in court were prompted by a Future Group legal petition after Amazon had written to India\u2019s market and antitrust regulators apprising them of the Singapore arbitration order of an interim stay. Amazon suffered its first setback in the case last week, when the antitrust regulator, Competition Commission of India, approved the Reliance-Future deal. Earlier, Reliance said it intends to complete the transaction \u201cwithout any delay.\u201d (Updates with comments from a local retail industry body in the tenth paragraph. An earlier version corrected the title of Amazon\u2019s lawyer.) \u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P."

    "article_text":"What Happened:\u00a0France seeks to collect \"digital tax\" for 2020 from the U.S. technology groups. The digital tax has been a sticking point between Washington and Europe for a long time as the U.S. calls it an unfair trade practice because it affects U.S. companies predominantly. The U.S. Trade Representative\u2019s office is expected to slap a 25% retaliatory tariff on $1.3 billion worth of French handbags and makeup, FT reports. A French official told FT that tech companies are the big winners of the pandemic and the country cannot wait any longer to impose taxes. The official added that big tech companies\u2019 turnover continues to grow and they did not pay a fair share of taxes even before the pandemic. In January, Washington and Paris had agreed to allow more time for talks on a multilateral taxation framework overseen by the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), and France agreed to stop collecting its digital tax temporarily. However, the U.S. suspended the talks with the OECD in June. Why It Matters:\u00a0Several governments have already introduced a digital tax or plan to introduce it soon. The argument is that tech companies pay low taxes on profits they make in many countries because they record the revenue in low-tax jurisdictions such as Ireland. Cathy Schultz, vice-president for tax policy at the National Foreign Trade Council in Washington, said that if no agreement comes from the OECD process, things will run rampant and escalate into a trade war.\u00a0 France expects an E.U. proposal for digital tax by early 2021 if the OECD talks fail, but it prefers an international solution through the organization. Price Action:\u00a0On Tuesday, FB shares closed higher by 3.16% at $276.92, and AMZN closed higher by 0.63% at $3,118.06. See more from Benzinga \u00a9 2020 Benzinga.com.

    "article_text":"By Aditya Kalra and Abhirup Roy NEW DELHI\/MUMBAI (Reuters) - India's National Stock Exchange (NSE) privately warned Future Retail it risked regulatory action for not making timely market disclosures about efforts by Amazon.com to block a disputed asset sale, according to e-mails reviewed by Reuters. Future Retail - one of country's top retailers - has been locked in a bitter dispute with Amazon over its $3.4 billion retail assets deal with Reliance Industries. Amazon is a business partner of Future and argues the Indian firm's asset sale breached some of their pre-existing agreements. Amazon had complained to stock exchanges, accusing Future of misleading public by making incorrect market disclosures, allegations the Indian group denies. The complaint came after Amazon on Oct. 25 won an injunction from an arbitrator to halt the Future-Reliance deal. Previously unreported e-mails exchanged between the NSE and Future show the stock exchange repeatedly requested the company submit more details of the arbitration order, seeking details of possible impact on financials, lenders and the Reliance deal. On Oct. 27, NSE asked Future why it had not disclosed the commencement of the arbitration proceedings and not shared the impact of the order. Future in response said it believed a disclosure wasn't required. NSE's listing compliance division rejected that argument. It demanded a series of disclosures be made within hours, \"failing which appropriate actions may be initiated\", the emails showed. Future Retail's Company Secretary, Virendra Samani, answered most of NSE's queries in a late night e-mail on Oct. 30, saying it was doing so \"in the best interest of all stakeholders\", the communications showed. Many of those responses were made public on directions of the NSE two days later in a six-page exchange filing by Future. Before that, Future had only submitted a disclosure on Oct. 26 in which it attached a media release saying it would ensure its deal with Reliance proceeded unhindered and that it was reviewing the arbitration order. The NSE and Future Retail did not respond to requests for comment. The legal dispute has now reached the Delhi High Court, where Future Retail has urged the court to stop Amazon from writing letters to regulators to block its Reliance deal, which is pending approvals from the market regulator and stock exchanges. The judge is expected to rule on the plea in the coming days. Amazon had separately asked India's market regulator to investigate Future for insider trading, saying it disclosed to Reliance price sensitive details of the arbitration order before its exchange filing in late October. Future has said its communications with Reliance, which is led by Asia's richest man Mukesh Ambani, were for a \"legitimate purpose\". NSE in e-mails at least twice asked Future Retail to provide a copy of the arbitration order to vet the disclosures, and also why it should not be disclosed as material price-sensitive information, emails between Oct. 27 and Oct. 30 showed. Future's Samani at first declined the request, stating in an e-mail that the order was \"confidential in nature\" and sharing further information could be \"deterimental\" to the company.

    "url":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/south-korea-unveils-ai-chip-063000516.html",
    "article_text":"(Bloomberg) -- South Korea is adding a new artificial intelligence chip to its arsenal of semiconductors as the nation seeks a bigger slice of the global tech market and an upgrade of its industrial capabilities. The Sapeon X220, unveiled Wednesday by the largest local carrier SK Telecom Co., is designed to speed up servers that cater to a growing number of mobile devices -- from drones to self-driving vehicles -- that perform better with AI. It\u2019s the latest product of the nation\u2019s decade-long push to broaden its dominance beyond memory chips, where Samsung Electronics Co. and SK Hynix Inc. control roughly two-thirds of the global market. South Korea sees data-processing chips as a major engine for future economic growth, along with fifth-generation wireless networks. The government has provided more than 600 billion won ($542 million) in support to develop such chips and plans to invest another trillion won over the next decade, viewing them as crucial in automating factories and improving the competitiveness of the country\u2019s exports. \u201cAs we teamed up with the government, we said, \u2018Let\u2019s make AI available and affordable for all of our companies,\u2019\u201d said Lee Jong-min, an SK Telecom vice president overseeing the chip development. \u201cSouth Korea has the demand, the full stack of tech needed to meet the demand, and the ability to take it to the next level.\u201d Semiconductors account for about one-fifth of South Korea\u2019s exports, most of them memory chips. The country is now turning to application-specific integrated circuits, or ASICs, such as the X220, which is tailored for AI operations. It follows a similar $1 billion investment plan announced by the U.S. government this summer, which also emphasized AI and public-private collaboration. As the first country in the world to roll out commercial 5G last year, South Korea believes it also can lead in adopting and optimizing AI by virtue of the nation\u2019s compact size, wide broadband coverage and smartphone penetration. Competition is heating up in the AI semiconductor space, with the likes of Amazon.com Inc. and Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google investing in their own bespoke server silicon. As more devices than ever come online, companies are betting they can unlock value and insights from the resulting trove of data through machine learning and analysis at scale. Like SK Telecom, U.S. competitors offer such cloud services to other companies, and the investment in designing the chips makes sense when factoring in the cost of electricity and the chips\u2019 ability to handle greater volumes of data more efficiently. Read more: Chip Industry Sees Danger of AI in Explosion of Electricity Use SK Telecom\u2019s chip, the size of a postage stamp, is the first Korean ASIC for data centers to be commercialized, according to the company. It represents the latest push by the Seoul-based carrier to expand beyond its traditional mobile and broadband businesses and keep up in an era of AI-driven innovation. The global AI chip market is currently led by Nvidia Corp., a graphics-card giant whose market value has eclipsed that of Intel Corp., the company historically most associated with semiconductor breakthroughs. Demand for Nvidia\u2019s GPUs has spiked in recent years, as the perennially increasing demands of high-resolution video games have been joined by a boom in cryptocurrency mining and other data-intensive applications that benefit from massively parallel processing. Even smartphone processors from the likes of Apple Inc. and Huawei Technologies Co. now come with dedicated cores for handling AI tasks, and the need for more ASICs like the Sapeon X220 is forecast to rise as artificial intelligence gains more ground in global technology. \u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P."

Also, catch Motley Fool analyst John Rotonti's interview with Gene Munster and Doug Clinton, the co-founders and managing partners of Loup Ventures, on the future of gaming. This video was recorded on November 20, 2020. Chris Hill: We begin with some of the biggest retailers in America. I mean, the numbers aren't tech company numbers, but still impressive. Topline was up 5.2%, 6.1% if you exclude currency effects. U.S. comps were up 6.4%. As you mentioned, e-commerce sales grew 79%. And you know the interesting thing is there, given the state of things today it's understandable why e-commerce is doing so well, but even last year the same quarter, those e-commerce sales grew 41%. So, we're seeing some nice acceleration there, and it's something that's been performing well for a while. Costs are coming under control, and interestingly in the U.S., you're seeing trip consolidation. So, folks are going to the store less, but they're buying more. So, we saw an average ticket increase of around 24%, but a transaction decrease of about 14%. So, fewer transactions, but they're buying more. And that's kind of that pantry-stuffing we've been hearing so much about. It seems like that's becoming a little bit more of a thing here as we go into the end of the year. Inventory levels are very healthy, they are enthusiastic about the Walmart+ offering; they're not really giving a whole lot of insight there yet, because it's still so new. But they just continue to do a lot of really good things, and the market is, I think, rewarding them for that. Chris Hill: Speaking of Target. Target's shares also hitting a new high this week after a blowout third quarter. Same-store sales up 20%. And Andy, as Jason sort of hinted at, their digital sales went through the roof. Cross: Yeah, Chris, digital sales are up 155%, that was a deceleration from a really strong second quarter of 195% growth. That digital sales growth now equals half of their comp growth. And their comp stores, as you mentioned, Chris, up more than 20%, really accelerated throughout the quarter. At the store comps itself, just in the stores was up 10%, that's a 4.5% increase in traffic growth. So, a little bit different than what we're seeing in Walmart. And then the average ticket size went up 15%. So, for Walmart it was up more than 24%, so Target a little bit less, but they're seeing still more traffic into their stores. Same-day services, like, order pickup, drive up, and Shipt up 217%. 95% of all their orders now are fulfilled by the store, so they're really leveraging that omnichannel experience that Jason mentioned for Walmart, Target really leveraging that. They've gained market share in all five of their core merchandise categories. Sales per square foot was up 19% so far this year. They're gaining market share. They've gained the equivalent of $6 billion, Chris, in market share this year. So, really strong category growth in decor and kitchen essentials, beauty, food comps, seeing a lot of strength in adult beverages, which I know, while I have not bought any at Target, I certainly have indulged in a little bit more this year. Earnings per share from their operating business is up 46%, really nice strong gross margins. They're seeing exceptionally low markdown rates, Chris. So, they're not marking down their products nearly as much as maybe they have in the past, and that's really been a boost for their business. Their operating margins expanded to 8.5% versus 5.3% last year, so they're going to resume their share buyback that they suspended earlier this year and they have $4.5 billion of that. So, real innovations. They have a new partnership with Beauty Ulta [Ulta Beauty] (sic) they have a new partnership with FAO Schwarz, they're going to offer 70 pieces of different toys for each of the under $20, they're making loads of investment in their technology. So, you have a business that is not priced all that expensively at 22X earnings and 10X operating profits, $85 billion in market cap. So, you get a nice little dividend to go and it's growing at 10%, Chris. So, overall, Target looks to be in really good shape right now. Hill: One minor quibble on my part, and maybe this was too much to hope for, but Brian Cornell, CEO of Target; Doug McMillon at Walmart, we didn't really get a lot of color from either one of them in terms of what they're expecting this holiday season. Like I said, that might have been a little too much to hope for given how guidance has gone away for a lot of these companies, but I was looking for that. Cross: Yeah, Chris, one thing, like many retailers, they are expanding that Black Friday timeout. Target will be closed on Thursdays, they're going to be open regular hours on Black Friday, but they're extending all of those deals. And whatever deals they are offering, like I said, they're not really doing a lot of markdowns throughout the month of November into December. So, really spreading that out to be able to benefit from that omnichannel operation. Hill: From general retail to home improvement. Home Depot and Lowe's, both out with third quarter reports this week. Similar stories, Jason, profits look good, same-store sales up, both are investing in customer and employee safety, and one more similarity, shares of both falling this week. Moser: [laughs] Yeah, fell a little bit this week, but still doing well overall for the year. Both companies' shares are outperforming the market and really, kind of, tracking each other pretty nicely. In regard to Home Depot, it really does feel like short of an unforced error on the part of management, I just don't know [laughs] what stops this train. I mean, this is a really, really good business that participates in one of the most attractive market opportunities out there, to my mind. But if you look at the numbers, sales of $33.5 billion for the quarter, that was up 23.2% from a year ago. Comp sales for the quarter were +24%, comp sales in the U.S. were +24.6%. Earnings per share, obviously, the growth there tracking with that performance. And when it comes to these businesses, oftentimes we're looking, again, at the tickets and the transactions. The comp average ticket for Home Depot grew 10%, comp transactions grew 13%, but the one point that really stood out to me was that during the third quarter, big-ticket comp transactions, those that are over $1,000, there was 23% growth there, which is just really impressive. I mean, you go to Home Depot, you know you need something, even if you don't know specifically what you need, but you know you're going in there, you're preparing yourself to spend some serious money, and that shows through in that metric there. And with Lowe's, a lot of similarities there. Total comps up just over 30%, they saw strength in DIY, the do-it-yourself, and the pro customers. Lumber has been a big driver this Fall; I think, with the warmer weather, we've seen a lot of activity out there. The pro business was up 20% for Lowe's, they are making a lot of investments there. But they've seen, I think, how big of a driver it can be for Home Depot and they're wanting to participate in that opportunity as well. So, 106% growth on Lowe's.com business. And we talk about transactions and tickets, they saw transaction growth of 16.4% and ticket growth of 13.7%. So, very similar stories, very understandable why they're succeeding, and I don't see that, really, changing anytime soon. Hill: Real quick, Jason, before they came out with earnings, Home Depot announced they're buying HD Supply for $8 billion, they had spun that out a dozen years ago or so, you like this move? Moser: Yeah, I do. You know, I think with something like a Home Depot, you're owning that stock primarily for the dividend, it's not something where the capital gains are just going to be massive, because it's already so big, although it is a big market opportunity. This I think adds to that market opportunity; it's a $55 billion marketplace as they see it. The maintenance, repair and operations, that MRO business, it's a really attractive one, and we've seen a lot of success stories come out of that market in the past. And so, bringing that into Home Depot's physical infrastructure, giving them that distribution and that capability, I think only helps them in the long run. So yeah, I think it's a pretty good deal. Cross: Yeah, Chris, they started this a few years ago, as they started the push, but it was very slow, because so much of their business is still in their stores. I think pre-COVID 80% of their business basically came from their stores. That's almost now completely reversed. As you mentioned, revenues up 22.4% to $1.8 billion, that was far ahead of analysts' estimates at $1.6 billion. Looking at their compatible brands, that was up 24%, and that was an acceleration from 10.5% in the second quarter. So, you saw growth in Williams-Sonoma of more than 30%. Pottery Barn Kids and Teens up the same, about 24%, and West Elm, their furniture business, up about 22%. So, as you mentioned, the e-commerce business up almost 50%; an acceleration from the second quarter. So, a lot of excitement going into that e-commerce business. Their store comps were down 11%, but they actually saw acceleration throughout the quarter, Chris, so it started worse [laughs] and then it [...] down a -11%. But what was really impressive, and what this means for the profitability, their gross margins saw 4% increase benefiting from lower occupancy costs, offset by shipping and fulfillment cost, as that continued to move more and more to that e-commerce. Their operating margin expanded to 15.6%, that's a record high and a double from last year. And their EPS was up 22%; it crushed estimates. The number was at $2.56 versus $1.56 estimates. So, really a lot of initiatives that they put forth are starting to come into play. And they've been benefiting, obviously, as more and more of us have been at home and looking to beautify our houses, improve our decor, and that's benefiting West Elm. Interesting, Chris, they also have been investing in the business-to-business market, which they see as a $1 billion sales opportunity for them. Right now, that's at about $300 billion. So, while most of their business is on the consumer side, they really are starting to push a little bit more into business-to-business. So, right now things are looking good for Williams-Sonoma, $8 billion market cap, sells at 6X operating profits, and 15X earnings are really not that expensive. You can't expect really high, super high growth, but you get a little 2% yield to go with it. Hill: Intuit started its fiscal year off with a bang. First quarter profits for the financial software company tripled. Shares of Intuit basically flat this week, Andy, but it has been a good year. Cross: Yeah, and revenues up 14%, Chris. Earnings on the adjusted side more than doubled and crushed estimates. The guidance was pretty good at, like, 8% to 10% for the fiscal year. And earnings per share at $8.48, at the midpoint, that's ahead of estimates, they continue to see some nice growth in their small business and self-employed, revenues there were up 13%, that's QuickBooks accounting, it was up 28%. Their QuickBooks online business was up 17%. International, up 50%. That ecosystem, they continue to talk about the strength within that. And the small business was up 24%; a little bit of a slowdown from Q4 with some lower retention, that's something I'm watching. They continue to make these big bets in AI and connect people and really become the center of small business for accounting and financial matters. And they had their Credit Karma acquisition coming up, and it's going to be interesting how they play along with that. So yeah, a pretty good quarter for Intuit, but nothing that really lit it on fire or was a really massive surprise. Moser: Yeah, and this is likely an overreaction to an extent. I mean, if you look back to when Amazon made the Whole Foods acquisition, for example, and grocery stores, writ large, shares plummeted; you know, they recovered. It took a little time. This is probably going to be somewhat similar to that. CVS and Walgreens, companies like that, they're a bit more protected. They are big, obviously, have a very large presence within this industry, and they rely a lot on those pharmaceutical sales. Now, it's interesting with GoodRx, though. I think the selling GoodRx was a bit more rational; at least, I understand it more. And when you look at GoodRx and the way it makes its money, makes its money from its core business, from pharmacy benefit managers, it's a free product for consumers. And so, why does that matter? Well, it matters because ultimately Amazon is looking at least to potentially cut pharmacy benefit managers out of the equation, out of the value chain here and work directly with health plans and employers. If something like that happens, it could certainly threaten GoodRx's revenue stream. And so, I understand the trepidation there. Clearly, GoodRx's CEO feels like that's less of a competitive threat and more of a complementary offering; I appreciate where he's coming from. It will all depend, really, on if Amazon is successful with this initiative. And given everything that they've done and their expertise, you know, I would not bet against them. [laughs] Hill: Workday's third quarter results were better than expected, but the software company's guidance for the fourth quarter caused shares of Workday to fall a little bit on Friday. Help me make sense of this, Andy. Cross: Revenues were up 18% for the quarter, Chris; that's a little slow down from a 20% growth last quarter. Their subscription revenue, which is the bulk of their business, almost 90% of revenues, was up 21%. Again, a little bit of a slowdown, but like you mentioned, Chris, the kind of guidance for the fourth quarter of their fiscal year was for subscription revenue growth of 18%; that's a deceleration from before, and the revenue growth of 22%. So, I think some of the concern, though, Chris, was more on like not giving the guidance for fiscal year 2022, and a lot of that was just because they're seeing this uncertainty around COVID and around expenditures. And they provide the human capital resource management software. With companies just looking to be very careful in how they're spending that, inclines their signing up right now and how much will continue to spend next quarter. So, a little bit of concern from Workday on how much growth they will see next year, and I think that's weighing on the stock, especially as they continue to talk more and more on the conference call about that issue. Hill: Based in Georgia and specializing in fried chicken, Zaxby's is one of the fastest growing restaurant chains in America. And that growth will probably continue in 2021 now that Zaxby's has teamed up with Goldman Sachs. The investment bank is buying a significant stake in Zaxby's, for more on this we turn to the Georgia native in the group, Jason Moser; is this investment warranted? Moser: Listen, I think yes. Okay. I mean, I know that the show -- the conversation, when it comes to chicken is always focused on Chick-fil-A or the Jangler. I mean, Mac, listen, as good as the Jangler can be, Zaxby's doesn't get enough attention. And I think as someone who's been to Zaxby's enough times, man! It's really good. I dare say, I think I actually might even put it above the Jangler. I know that sounds crazy coming from me, but it's certainly possible. I can understand Goldman's attraction there. The biggest challenge is going to be to try to take this brand and grow it beyond its Southeastern roots. I mean, that was the big challenge for Bojangles when that company went public, and you know, they weren't really able to pull that off. Zaxby's is a bit more modern, it's a bit more of a modern flair to it. So, I think they probably could stand a better chance of it becoming a national brand. And you know, Goldman has a lot of money and a lot of levers to pull, so this is definitely a good thing for Zaxby's. And hey, it very well could turn out to be an IPO at some point here, and listen, I would be interested. [laughs] Hill: I was going to say, real quick, Andy, you got to figure if Goldman Sachs is involved, Zaxby's is probably going public, maybe 2020? Cross: Well, it's been a huge, hot IPO market this year, Chris. [laughs] So, maybe they'll continue with that and maybe could bring some of that spice over to the IPO market too. Hill: Gene Munster and Doug Clinton are the Co-Founders and Managing Partners of Loup Ventures, a venture capital firm that invests in frontier tech companies. Motley Fool analyst John Rotonti recently talked with the two of them about some of the video game companies they like best, as well as what do you think of how tech giants like Apple and Amazon are investing in this space. But we'll start with Doug Clinton's bull case for investing in video gaming. [...] Doug Clinton: Obviously, we broadly have kind of three components to our thesis. The first is that games are becoming much more like SaaS software than they had been in the past. You know, you don't just go into a GameStop and buy GTA V anymore, and that sort of ends your relationship from a paid standpoint with the publisher. Now, there's in-game content that you buy. There are often season-long subscriptions that you buy, and there are multiple seasons. And so, one game really can become this recurring revenue mechanism that really wasn't the case in the past, if you think about gaming five, six years ago. And if you think about the multiples of gaming stocks versus SaaS stocks, SaaS stocks trade at about a 2X higher multiple right now than gaming stocks. And I think if that corrects over time, obviously, that gives tremendous upside to gaming stocks. We do think it should correct, just like Apple, historically, was given a hardware multiple. And I think investors, and to Gene's credit, he was the one who really noticed the rift there, and said, that, hey, Apple should trade more like a SaaS company, now it does today over 30X forward earnings, we think the same thing should happen in gaming. The second thing is that gaming is largely under-monetized. And we went and we looked at, actually, the cost per hour of entertainment for consumers. And Netflix costs about $0.37\/hour for the average user. Spotify about $0.33\/hour. And Fortnite, League of Legends, you know, the games that are free-to-play for the most part, they cost less than $0.16\/hour right now. So, they're about half of what we see for Netflix. We think that that means they're very under-monetized, because people are actually more engaged with those games than they are with Spotify, than they are with Netflix. And so, we think over time those, sort of, pricing rifts should correct themselves. And then finally, our last piece is that games are the future of social networking. And if you think about Fortnite, I think that they are starting to show that future already. For millennials, for Gen Z, you know, they have really three places they spend time, it's home, it's school, and it's Fortnite. And now they probably [laughs] don't even spend time at school, it's just home and Fortnite. And so, I think as gaming becomes more accepted among the younger generation, they expect to have more interactive experiences in their social world, and to connect with their friends. And so, we think the next Facebook, whatever that ultimately looks like, will be very game-like, it won't be this, sort of, scroll and look at pictures and just like things like we see today. John Rotonti: So, sticking with you for a second, Doug, Loup Ventures was a private market investor in Unity Software before it came public and had its IPO. So, you've had a while to think about that business. What is your investment thesis in Unity? Clinton: We love Unity. And you know, I just gave you, kind of, our thesis on gaming. I would say that is piece one, is bullishness on gaming as an industry. Unity has, what we think, something like 50% market share among AAA in-house developed 3D software for game developers. Point two is that, that type of software creating these virtual environments, these 3D worlds that are movable and have motion and physics, we think that's very relevant for other industries, like architecture, like manufacturing, and so we're starting to see these other types of customers, industrial customers, come in and use Unity Software. And we think it's a huge market opportunity. If you, sort of, comp it against Autodesk. Autodesk has somewhere around 4 million, 5 million annual subscribers to its software, we think that same size market opportunity exists for Unity in this, sort of, industrial opportunity that they're just starting. Go back to our curves, this is a new curve for them that they're just starting. And then, our third piece of the thesis is, augmented and virtual reality, something we've been bullish on for a long time, I think AR and VR has taken longer than a lot of investors have hoped, but we're still optimistic for the future, we don't know how long it's going to take until those technologies really have an inflection point. It could be five years. But when they do, Unity is really the tool to develop in AR and VR, and so we see that as actually a third curve, if we keep using, kind of, our growth curve model, that sits out after they start to penetrate this industrial curve. So, we see, kind of, three consecutive curves for Unity, and that's why we're still bullish. Rotonti: Three curves, better than two. I love that. Gene, do you see a path to profitability, GAAP profitability? And if so, what is your rough ballpark of what you think Unity's operating margins or cash flow margins, or whatever margin you want to give us, could be? Gene Munster: So, the path to profitability is obviously dependent upon how big of a market these can be, these different curves and where they take off in terms of how to get there and how long it'll take to get there? It's probably a year to a year-and-a-half out of, like, sustained profitability. And that's just simply those revenue growth rates numbers and the amount that they'll have to invest in the business. I don't think that that doesn't change our optimism, that negative peace around profitability because ultimately this should be a higher margin business. I think this should have margins that are 30%, +40% type margins. And you know, ultimately if we can get to Microsoft plus type margins, I think that the story will be rewarded. The key for us is less about what that margin target is, it really comes back to some of those growth curves that Doug talked about earlier. If we are right on getting that growth number right, this is something that we have observed for a long time, is that we get that right on the topline right, I think that the bottom-line will eventually take care of itself. In the case of Amazon, it's gotten the topline right, the bottom-line has never taken care of itself, but investors are confident that that will eventually happen because the topline is so strong. When we think about Unity, we think it is a similar type of a curve where it's just such an open-ended opportunity. So, we're comfortable in this gray area around profitability, lack of profitability in the near-term because we believe strongly in the future. If I would just want to emphasize something that Doug had said earlier too about Unity that to his third and final piece, you mentioned it too, John, about AR and VR, is that we're believers that this is fundamentally going to change how humans communicate and interact. And it feels maybe distant from reality right now given the tech is still nascent, but if you're going to, kind of, benchmark us, and let's say we come back in two years and we have a conversation about AR, in particular, I think that the consensus will be that this is moving in a direction more of the fabric of how consumers are using tech. And I think that unity will continue to appreciate as that reality starts to unfold. Rotonti: Doug, do you have another gaming company that really excites you right now in addition to Unity? If so, what is it and why do you like it? Clinton: We do. I'll give you two things, one is, thematically we love the esports space. Now, there's not really an easy public way to play that, I think the companies that we're most interested in in esports are still private, but the public company that we have been tracking very closely is Take-Two. If I tie that back to our comment around gaming and social networking being the future of gaming, we actually think Take-Two has the best chance at being the publisher that ultimately delivers that network. And the reason is simple, they are, in my opinion, the best developers of digital worlds of any game publisher. Look at GTA V and just the GTA, I think, franchise in general, it is as close to a real world as anyone has ever created. You know, World of Warcraft, that's a different kind of world, Fortnite is a different kind of world. And I think that this social world that we ultimately want to spend more time in in the future probably resembles something closer to the real world than something that's more cartoonish. And so, that's our bet on Take-Two is, you know, whether they see it yet or not, we don't know, but I think over the next five, 10 years, they have a real opportunity to turn GTA into not just a game, but a place where people hang out, they interact almost like in real world. There's this fun little, kind of, social media thing that happened in GTA V, which is by the way a seven-year-old game, which is incredible, during the pandemic, it was cold Purple Gang\/Green Gang. And so, there were these makeshift street gangs, essentially, of kids that you chose a side, you were purple or green and you'd go and you'd, sort of, like rumble in the streets and you would, you know, do things together. And you know, [laughs] not promoting gangs in any way, but the idea of going into a digital world and sort of doing something with your friends akin to something that would be happening in the real world, I think is really powerful, and there's something there that I think is worth digging into more as it comes to Take-Two. Rotonti: Gene, Microsoft is really leaning into gaming. It has Xbox, Minecraft, Flight Simulator, and it recently launched Xbox All Access, which I believe gives users the Xbox hardware plus access to over a 100 games for somewhere around $25\/month. And then it recently spent $7.5 billion to acquire ZeniMax, which is the parent of Bethesda, which is one of the largest private game publishers in the world. So, my question is, which of the other game offerings from the other mega-cap tech companies excite you the most? Is it Amazon with Twitch and Luna, is it Google with Stadia, is it Facebook's new gaming offering for mobile, or is it Apple Arcade? Munster: Twitch is my simple answer. And part of the reason is that they're doing something that those other companies are not doing. I mean, they're ultimately trying to create titles, and that's good. And we talked about Take-Two and why we love Take-Two and their content and their titles, but I think what's unique about Twitch is just that idea of being, kind of, a venue, a platform, an engagement piece, all the right buzzwords around this. And I still believe that as we fast forward over the next decade, it's hard to predict which titles are going to be the hits, it's easier to predict that the theme itself just gaming as a, kind of, a core case for anyone under the age of 25 for entertainment, you know, that is an easier path to predict. And I think Twitch is probably the best suited to capitalize on that. Then they could get in their own games too, but just that ability to bring everyone together, I think is a massive opportunity. So, if I had to pick one, it would be Twitch. I'm curious about Doug's take on that too, we haven't discussed it. Rotonti: What do you think, Doug? Clinton: I'd rank it quick. Amazon, Google, Facebook, Apple, [laughs] actually the order you gave it in, in my opinion, same reason. I think Twitch is such a powerful platform, people want to stream, kids want to stream and get attention that way, I think that tie-in is really powerful. Google, to me, has, you know, the ability to deliver incredible streaming for Stadia. And then Facebook, I think, has the optionality around pulling in your social network, since it's already built out, I think that's their value-add. We'll see how it plays out, but I would put Amazon at the top too. Munster: This is a rare chance when Apple is at the bottom of the list of something, and I agree, and I'm OK with that. Rotonti: So, does it matter that Arcade is not a big deal yet? Munster: It itself doesn't matter, if they continue to advance services and other services that don't matter. I think another one that doesn't matter is Apple News. So, I think they need to collectively add these up. The simple takeaway is it really doesn't matter, what matters most -- I don't want to get off the gaming topic -- matters most is their ability to build recurring revenue within their hardware, and this doesn't have anything to do with Arcade or Apple News. [...] Hill: Guys, the shack is back, RadioShack has been bought by Retail Ecommerce Ventures, they plan to relaunch RadioShack as an online business next year. Andy, just in time for RadioShack's 100th anniversary. I don't know which I'm more gobsmacked by, that RadioShack is coming back or that RadioShack started in 1921. Cross: Yeah, started in your backyard, Chris, started in Boston, when I think maybe a couple brothers started an electronics store. So, yeah, it's almost 100 years old. So, actually if you Google RadioShack, you'll see it pops up like a site that you can look at. But I think generally it's again, more and more of this push, like we saw with Williams-Sonoma, more and more retail companies are going to move online and that's a huge advantage for their cost structure, it allows them to be able to provide very quick service without the overhead. So, it'll be interesting to see how this plays out. RadioShack, I believe that they are some kind of brand, there's some brand value in there, I'm not sure how much this firm paid for that, but there's some brand value. And what they can do with it is to be determined and obviously there's a lot of competition out there. We get so much of our stuff shipped directly from Amazon and other players, so it's not a not competitive space, but if you're going to do it with that brand, this is the way to go. Hill: All right, two quick announcements before we get to the stocks on our radar. First, next week, a tradition unlike any other, it's our Annual Thanksgiving Special. So, please stay tuned for that. It's the one show during the year where we actually have a sound effect. Second, if you've ever wondered which stocks Motley Fool CEO Tom Gardner owns, good news, you can invest right alongside him in our Everlasting Portfolio service, it is backed by more than $10 million of The Motley Fool's own investment capital.

Our man behind the glass, Dan Boyd, is going to hit you with a question. Jason Moser, you're up first, what are you looking at this week? Reported another very strong quarter, record bookings, backlog is now greater than $1.8 billion, grew revenue 21% from the previous quarter. And one of the things that I've been keeping an eye on with this company was its ability to develop more recurring revenue streams. They do a great job of getting the technology in the cars, then it really becomes a matter of, you know, going from that one-time transaction and developing more of a recurring revenue stream. And they're showing that they're able to do that through their Cerence connected services, they're signing some more deals with suppliers or providers there. So, it's just another encouraging quarter. It's been a tremendous performer for us in both of the services that I run here at The Motley Fool. So, I'm very excited to see what the future holds for Cerence. Hill: Dan, question about Cerence? Dan Boyd: Absolutely, Chris. Jason, when it comes to automated driving, are you ever going to get in a fully automated car and let it drive you somewhere? Moser: You know, I don't like to ever say never, you know, I would assume probably so, but you know, I actually enjoy the act of driving. Maybe that's an unpopular opinion, but I kind of enjoy driving. So, the more I can drive, I feel a little bit better about that. Hill: Andy Cross, what are you looking at? Cross: Dan and Chris, a true radar site, because it's not yet public, but it did file its paperwork, Roblox has filed its S-1 this week. I'm really interested in learning more about this business. It operates that free-to play gaming and developer platform with more than 30 million daily active users. So, many 9- to 12-year olds. They say, two-thirds of 9- to 12-year olds are on their platform. They have 18 million different experiences that you can join. 31 million daily active users; that was up 80% from a year ago, Chris. And hours played this year increased by more than a 100% to 22.2 billion. 2.6 hours per day, Dan. So, I think Roblox, when it goes public, with the symbol of RBLX, will be one to keep on your radar. Hill: Dan? Boyd: Yeah, Andy, you're a dad, any Roblox users in your house? Cross: Oh, yes. I've tried to cut it out at one hour per day, but it's really that social platform, Dan. And so far, I'm good, they're not up to 2.6 hours per day, and I hope it stays below that. Hill: What do you want to add to your watchlist, Dan? Boyd: Chris, you know I'm a big fan of those IPOs, I'm going with Roblox. Hill: All right. Andy Cross, Jason Moser, guys, thanks for being here. \u00a0Cross: Thanks, Chris. Moser: Thank you. Hill: That's going to do it for this week's Motley Fool Money. The show is mixed by Dan Boyd, our Producer is Mac Greer. I'm Chris Hill, thanks for listening, we'll see you next week.

This video was recorded on November 13, 2020. Dylan Lewis: It's Friday, November 13th, and we're talking about Airbnb. I'm your host Dylan Lewis, and I'm joined by Fool.com's Jason Hall. Jason, how are you doing? Jason Hall: Fantastic. This is going to be a fun one. It's funny, right? How many of your Industry Focus colleagues and you got into, just almost -- I mean, I think if you guys were in the office, there actually might have been fisticuffs over this. Lewis: [laughs] You know, to let people in a little bit behind the scenes, yeah, there were some active Slacks going back-and-forth about exactly where this one falls. You know, it's a tech company, they operate in the consumer goods space. I could see a lot of different claims being laid to this one. What I will say, Jason, is that I know Emily Flippen was pretty into covering this one, when the news hit, I happened to be in a position to talk about it, but I'll throw it out there, she talked DoorDash, which I would argue could be a tech company. Hall: With me, actually. Lewis: Yeah. So, you're the neutral party here, everyone else is [laughs] trying to lay claim to things. And you're just like, if you want to talk about it, I'm happy to talk about it with you. [laughs] Hall: [laughs] I'm just soaking up all the goodness here, and it's so unfair, but I'm going to roll with it. Lewis: Yeah, you know, Jason, we do S-1 shows all the time and I think they're fun in general, because it's a first look at a business, we really get to dive into everything that they're disclosing, and that's fantastic. But it's particularly fun for a company that we know so well; and in my case, I've used plenty. So, I think, probably most of our audience is going to be familiar with Airbnb, but we should do a quick little rundown on who they are and what they do. For folks that are unfamiliar, it is an online vacation rental marketplace. And folks who have a property can make it available for short-term rentals. Typically, short-term rental nature, usually weekend trips or multi-week vacations. They can be used for longer trips as well, though it's a bit less common. And some quick history on the business, it was founded in 2008 by roommates and former classmates Brian Chesky and Joe Gebbia. And it started out as AirBedandBreakfast.com. It was their answer to the absurd accommodation shortage in San Francisco. Fun fact, Jason, if you go to AirBedandBreakfast.com, it takes you to Airbnb, they still have that URL. Hall: Of course it does, it makes sense. Absolutely, it makes sense. And here's the funny thing about, I think it's interesting, because it was an airbed. They were literally renting out airbeds and their apartment for people that were coming for a conference. I think they rented airbeds to three or four different people in their little two-bedroom apartment in the Bay Area. And now what the business has become today is like the law of unintended consequences, right? This is not a business of [laughs] people renting out airbeds in their living room and in their dining room, this is a completely different business model. Lewis: This reminds me a little bit of the \"necessity is the mother of invention\" quote, where, [laughs] you know, this is perhaps a problem that is very unique to very specific markets, and San Francisco, obviously, being one of them, where people are willing to accept very barebones accommodations because things are so expensive there, it's in so high demand. [laughs] They've grown far beyond their origins here, but I think that they tapped into something and then realized very quickly that there's probably a more refined version of this that scales really well. And as it turns out, it is a pretty viable business. I am a customer, and I think the value prop here is one that you recognize as well, Jason. Hall: Oh, no doubt about it. I'm also a customer. As a matter of fact, I'm married and we have a young child, and we almost exclusively use Airbnb for leisure travel, just because it's easier, right? It's nice to have some privacy when you have a young kid, because with a hotel, you don't know who's going to be next to you and how late they're going to be up and how much noise they are going to be making, even if they're watching the TV, you can hear. It's nice to have the kitchen there to throw some cereal in a bowl for the kid, that sort of thing. And actually, we started using Airbnb years and years ago, before having kids. We have some close friends that -- I'm in Southern California now -- we have some close friends that we met here, they actually ended up moving to the D.C. area. And within a year or so of their moving, we decided we would start planning a trip every year together. And we always travel around the July 4th weekend, the July 4th holiday. And we go for a week. And we started doing international travel. We went to Peru. We went to Iceland, and we've done a few other things too, and we always did Airbnb, every single time. And it just worked out incredible. Lewis: Yeah, I think just to use my hometown and, kind of, The Fool's hometown of D.C., as an example for why it's so compelling as a customer. You look at a map of D.C., and most of the stuff is downtown. You know, you have the museums, you have the archives, you have access to the mall and, obviously, the White House and all these things. And that's where all the hotels are. Unfortunately, you have the restaurants that are down there, you have some parks down there, but it's not a very vibrant late-night scene. And I know personally, you know when I travel, I like to be somewhere that feels a little bit more like where I'd live if I was in that city, and just be able to kind of explore it in what feels like a little bit more of an organic way. And so, for D.C. that tends to be Mount Pleasant, Columbia Heights, and those types of neighborhoods where I live. And so, there aren't really a lot of hotels around there. If that's the vibe [laughs] you're going for, you need an Airbnb. And I think that they managed to scratch that itch really well. I think what they also offer a lot of people is just flexibility on how they're traveling, to your point, about having a kid with you and just being able to easily throw meals together, and have a full kitchen where you're staying. You know, I know people that do family reunions and they get a big Airbnb, they do a barbecue, they have a big yard, all those kinds of stuff. I think it just gives you a little bit more wiggle room with a lot of the things that you might want with travel but often have to sacrifice. And I mean, that's really valuable to people, and on the flipside, if you're a property owner or you have a lease that allows you to do it, to be able to say, yeah, I'm not going to be here for two months, I'm traveling for work. You know, it's nice for people who have properties to be able to make some extra money. It's kind of a nice little win-win. It has created [laughs] a little bit of a side market where people are intentionally buying places and then basically exclusively using them as Airbnbs, which creates some housing supply issues and some regulatory issues that we might touch on later. But I think, by and large, when this is used the right way, it's a really wonderful solution for a lot of people. Hall: Yeah, it is, and we'll touch on a little bit more, but it's created an entire cottage industry, really, of companies, businesses that exclusively buy properties in all kinds of different areas, and that's all they do, is operate these Airbnbs. Lewis: Yeah. And I think in a perfect world, you know, I like to stay in someone's house, but at the same time, it's nice to stay at a location where, you know, if my friends are going to be nearby, we can easily be half-a-block away, not have to worry quite so much about finding hotels and all of that stuff. Clearly, Jason, you and I are not alone in thinking that [laughs] this is a good concept. And you know, you don't get a start with a B. unicorn valuation without getting a couple fans along the way. This company, prior to early 2020, was growing like crazy. You look at their results for the full-year for 2019, some of the key metrics that they look at their gross booking value, kind of, similar to what we look at for a lot of these payments companies, you know, with what they process, up 29% year-over-year to $38 billion; that is a very big number. Hall: Yeah, that's enormous, right? And obviously, what they get is a smaller percentage of that, but that's the amount of money that people are willing to go to their platform and spend, [laughs] and that's telling. And just, I think, for some context here, Marriott International did about $14 billion in revenue last year. So, again, revenue doesn't exactly translate to this, but Marriott is a big hotel operator, so they collect the vast majority of those revenues that come in as bookings, so context. This is a great, big business. Lewis: It is. And I think their full-year revenue for 2018 was about $4.8 billion, which actually puts [laughs] them ahead of Hilton in annual revenue, which is hard to believe because this is a company that is still pretty early on in its growth stage. But it has a concept that works, and I think it's created such a market around it that it's been able to enjoy a lot of growth along the way, because the rest of that market is just trying to catch up. There are competitors, however, I think that they operate in, kind of, a slightly different space than the hotels. They're catering to different customers. So, really, a lot of their main competition is going to be people in this rental market, this kind of more specified house rental market and vacation rental market, like the VRBOs [Vacation Rentals by Owner] of the world. Hall: Right. Lewis: Putting some more numbers to the business. That $4.8 billion in revenue basically tracks year-over-year in terms of growth with that annual gross booking value. There are going to be some slight puts-and-takes there, but by and large those numbers are going to trend together. So, up 30% year-over-year. Operating loss of about $500 million on that. Total loss of $674 million. And we're focusing, [laughs] Jason, on the 2019 full-year numbers, because I think, in some ways, the company kind of gets a Mulligan in 2020. You know, they were thrown such a [laughs] difficult and, really, business model-bending series of events, as a lot of companies were in 2020, that it's kind of hard to get a really good sense of what's going on with this business if you're looking at anything from the past six months. Hall: Yeah, I agree. But in some ways, I think it's obviously still going to be worth taking a look at the numbers, because I think in some ways, Airbnb may have been more resilient than more traditional, again, we're going to comp it to hotels in a lot of ways, because that's kind of the obvious comp, and it's clearly taking business from that market, but I think in ways it's been more resilient than a lot of hotels. Lewis: Yeah. So, I know some listeners are going to be there being like, why are you talking 2019? We'll get to 2020 too, we'll talk about it, but I think just to kind of give you -- Hall: It's a better baseline. Lewis: It is. It gives you a better sense of, like, when things are generally going OK, you know, what are we seeing here? And I mentioned that loss, just kind of a sense of where the money is going, the cost of revenue about $1.1 billion, which means that if you put some quick math to it, the gross margins for this company are about 75%, which is darn high and [laughs] can create a very compelling investment opportunity very quickly. However, those margins are getting eaten up, because they are spending heavily in operations, product development, and general administration. All of that together winds up being somewhere in, like, the $2 billion-something range. But really, Jason, the biggie here is sales and marketing, that's $1.6 billion on its own. I'm guessing that's not going anywhere anytime soon. Hall: I would expect not. Again, the bottom-line is, with a business like this, you want to see them spending on these sorts of things, because they're establishing dominance, they're building a market presence, so that the network effect of their scale is attractive to all the stakeholders. And at some point, what you just want to see is that the cash flows, the acceleration of cash flows, becomes bigger than the acceleration of spending on this, that's kind of the strategic thing that you want to be looking at. But, no, it's going to get bigger. Lewis: Yeah. And it's early innings in the space that they're into, I think that this is very much a market that's in landgrab mode, and so for them, to be the first choice for customers who still haven't come online to doing vacation rentals and are maybe still hotel-stayers, to be able to say, like, we're the one for you, ignore Vrbo, [laughs] you know, ignore some of those competitors out there, because that's valuable customer acquisition. And if you can become the definitive, the default for them, that's going to pay off long-term. We should talk a little bit about what we've seen so far, and I said it before, but COVID-19 really threw the numbers for this business out of whack. We look at the first nine months ended September 30th, 2020, Jason, revenue was $2.5 billion, down from $3.7 billion in the same period a year ago. That is a pretty significant haircut. Hall: It is. And I mean, the bottom-line is that, that's what happens when you lose basically two months entirely, just you know, if you look it's interesting, you start looking at some of the data in the S-1 where they talk about their bookings and you see negative numbers, because they had so many bookings that they had more cancellations than bookings they got in that same period. I mean, [laughs] the meter literally ran backwards for 2.5 months. Lewis: Yeah. And it's nice to see that they were able to survive it. They did have to make some pretty dramatic changes, and they wound up having to trim costs pretty dramatically. So, I think they laid off about 25% of the global workforce. They weren't producing salaries that executives were receiving. The sales and marketing budget took a dip; I imagine, as things return, that that's going to go right back up. But they also issued some debt financing to make sure that they were in a relatively good position from an operating standpoint, which thankfully, they were in a position to do. You see a much higher debt burden on the books for them now than you might have back in 2019; and I think it's because they wanted to make sure that they had access to cash. Hall: That's, I guess, one of the reasons that they're really looking to try to do an IPO relatively soon, as they want to make sure that their balance sheet is as bolstered as possible. Because again, as much as the spending on sales and marketing is happening, when you have to cut 25% of your workforce and you are a tech company, and you're building out an infrastructure, that makes it harder to grow. Now, it's going to be even harder to replace the staff that you lost, right? So, it's really important that they make sure they have as much capital accessible as possible. And my understanding is that the debt that they took on, I think, all of it is convertible. So, I think at some point that that debt is most likely going to get turned into shares down the road. So, it's one of the things investors need to be aware of. As we start getting more pricing and that sort of thing, as we get closer to an IPO, what is the impact of that debt on the future -- what's the word I'm looking for here? Lewis: Shareholders? [laughs] I mean, really, like, it's a dilution thing, right? Hall: \"Dilution,\" that's the word, yeah, exactly. So, you have to be aware of it, right? Lewis: Yeah. And then so, I mean, if you look at the books and you can, kind of, look at this debt a little bit differently, depending on how you're playing out the first 12 months or so of them being a public a trading company, but my count in the S-1, $3 billion in cash and long-term debt of about $1.8 billion; a hefty amount of convertible notes in there, TBD on how that actually turns out. But even at that point, Jason, that's a net cash position, they're going to be in a spot where they can pretty comfortably weather some uncertainty for a while. And I think what's kind of interesting is to look at some of the commentary that we've seen from management about how COVID has affected usage on their platform. One of the things that really stuck out to me was, they have seen bookings within 200 miles of users go from about a third to half of their overall bookings. And what they're seeing more and more of is people [laughs] just getting out for short periods of time, you know, and maybe not even going very far, but just kind of needing a change of scenery. Hall: Well, anecdotally, I can tell you we've done that twice, and we'll do it one more time before the end of the year. We have a couple of family groups that are kind of part of our cluster, I guess, you could describe it. Our kids are in day care together, so we really have exactly the same risk profiles already. And we rented a house, a gigantic huge place that had a full playground, and a big pool and all this stuff. And I think it cost each family a couple of hundred bucks a night and we did it for a four-day weekend back in, like, May. And it was just a great way to get away, and look at different walls, right, and let the kids get out and stretch out, play. And then we did a little trip to the mountains, a couple of -- maybe two months ago. It was a smaller thing and it was just our family, but same thing, you know, these were all driving distance away. And we plan to do something for New Years as well, just our family. So, yeah, I think, it's like we've seen with a lot of other parts of the economy, where people that are still earning money and still working have a lot more disposable income right now that they're not using to go out to eat every Friday night with friends, they're not taking that big family vacation to Hawaii or the Bahamas or whatever. So, there's that extra disposable income, and right now Airbnb is in a great position to be a beneficiary from that. Lewis: Yeah, and that's kind of an interesting take on a trend that they were already benefiting from, because, you know, you rewind the clock to February of 2020, and the narrative, for the most part when it came to consumer spending is that people are spending more on experiences, were moving a little bit away from spending on things. And I think Airbnb, in particular, because they offer remote locations, exotic locales, interesting spaces, also really benefits from this kind of social media-fication of everything. And you know, it's much more fun, I think, to be in a spot that is kind of Instagram-able, whether that's your MO or not, than to be in a hotel. And for them, to be able to offer unique experiences that feel a little bit more curated, feel more local, you know, craft is such a big part of what we're going for these days, they're already benefiting from that. And then you put people who are still making money in a position where, frankly, a lot of those purchases otherwise aren't really happening. You aren't really going out to eat nearly as much, you're probably not buying as much because you're very keenly aware, if you're like me, of all the stuff you already have in your house and you're trying to work through that rather than clutter things up. So, I think they're fairly well-positioned, given what a massive shock this was to their business. Hall: Yeah, there's no doubt about that. And again, I think it's one of those things where, you know, you think about, like, the Lowe's and Home Depots of the world, that have gotten this big benefit of people doing home improvement projects and things that could have near-term implications, for maybe their business won't be as great when we do go back to normal, I don't think that's the same for Airbnb, I think maybe to the contrary maybe more like e-commerce, where a lot of people have used e-commerce that weren't planning to ever user e-commerce, and they're going to keep using e-commerce. I think, maybe Airbnb might be the same thing, people that, still, they were loyal to Hilton, because they got their Hilton Rewards, right? Maybe they decided, I don't feel comfortable in a hotel, but we need a weekend getaway, so we're going to go and we're going to rent a house somewhere, and they did it through Airbnb, and they had a great experience. And so, now [laughs] they're Airbnb customers. So, I think that that's what we're going to see, is that it's just -- because again, this is such a young industry, it's not mature, and they're still in that landgrab phase. Yeah, I think it's a really, really interesting time right now. Lewis: Yeah, I think that the timing of this is really interesting with where this industry is, Jason. Because Airbnb, in a lot of ways, had a pretty big lead here. And there's Vrbo, and we can talk about them a little bit, but they're owned by HomeAway, which is then bought by Expedia. So, if you're interested, there's a publicly investable player in the space already, but you know ... Hall: But it's not a pureplay, right? [laughs] And there's plenty of other problems worse we could talk about with the Expedia business. I can say this, just real quickly on it, I was originally pretty loyal to Vrbo when Airbnb was really just kind of getting a little bit of a critical mass, just because Vrbo was the one that was there. And they were started in Europe, a little bigger in Europe, and became a little more available in the States, mainly because there were a couple of areas that we were doing family gatherings and we needed a big space, and there were things on Vrbo. But within a year, I just stopped even looking at [laughs] Vrbo and just shifted to Airbnb, because of availability everywhere, and it just became easier. Lewis: Yeah, I think that's right, and they benefit a little bit from that Kleenex effect or the Google effect, I've seen it called too. Where it's like, when you think of this category, you don't think of Vrbo, you think of Airbnb. And they've really been able to cement themselves as the consumer brand in this space. What I'm curious about with the timing of this is, you know, they're like, I said before, still kind of in landgrab mode, there are a lot of people that aren't using these, still using hotels and are customers to be won, so to speak. You know, does this put them in a spot where they lose a little bit of that first-mover edge because the industry has been halted, and it gives some of the other players a little time to catch up? Hall: You know, I don't know if that's going to be the case, just because the playing field is pretty leveled right now in that regard, everybody is affected similarly. And I think simply the fact that they do have such a -- not a first-mover, but a most-mover advantage, because they're the pureplay and this is where all the resources are focused right now. And if you think about other companies that are trying to get into it, a lot of them are doing it defensively, because [laughs] they're trying to protect their entrenched interests in the short-term stay, which -- I mean, that's the big market, right, the long-term addressable market is pretty small, this is the short-term market really where this is focused. I really think that they still come out of this as, if not the winner, I think they are probably going to be \"the\" winner, they're certainly \"a\" winner, because they have the resources, they have that, like you said, the Kleenex effect, it's not just the name that people looking for a place think of, it's the name that people that are thinking about it as a source of income and they own a property or thinking about investing a property, it's the name that comes to mind for them as well. Lewis: Yeah. And I think that this is probably a winner take a good chunk market, [laughs] but I think there are probably a couple of winners here. And one of the main reasons is, you know, this is definitely an industry that benefits from network effects, but there isn't any exclusivity to those network effects, which is kind of hard. And so, for the likes of Airbnb, like, you can list on there, but then you can also list on Vrbo. And so, yes, those platforms benefit from there being more consumers and more property owners, but there's nothing to keep people from operating in both spaces. And in that sense, it does feel a little bit like Uber and Lyft and some of the rideshare market dynamics, where, yes, you've built out this wonderful network, but now [laughs] we're in a spot where other people can also benefit from this wonderful network that you've created. Hall: Yeah, I think so. I think maybe another way to think about it is, like, Visa and MasterCard. You have Visa that is much larger, if you think about it, in the consumer space, for consumer spending than MasterCard, but you have two companies that have done extremely well. And, yeah, there's more friction, you have to go to the bank and get one or get the other, actually just go online, [laughs] you don't actually have to go to the bank anymore, but at some point you end up with a Visa and a MasterCard both in your wallet. And to a certain extent, the one that you use is just the one that you use. I mean, there may have been a reason that you started out that way, but at some point, it just becomes, [laughs] that's where the momentum is. And I think that's most likely what we're going to see. And we could see, like, some incentive wars at some point, and that's what -- like, I use my Costco Visa a lot, because I get a lot of rewards there. But then when I shop at Amazon, I use my Amazon Visa, because I get rewards there. So, at some point, we could see something like that happen, right, where there's loyalty programs and that sort of thing that kind of drive the market, but I think at this point there's just such, they have such a head start and there's so much mindshare with the brand that it's going to be tough for anybody to really meaningfully catch up, because again, nobody else is really pure playing this in the same way that Airbnb is. Lewis: One of the other, kind of, main topics that I think we need to hit as we're kind of running through some of the existential questions facing this business is, you know, how does the regulatory picture come together in this space? You know, this is a gig economy company in a lot of ways but it faces a very different set of regulatory risks than the likes of Uber and Lyft. You know, it's not a labor-based thing that's going to dramatically affect their costs, it's like a local municipality thing, and it's much more regionalized. Hall: And it costs the company more money to figure it out. You go on Airbnb's website and you look at Ventura County, which is where I live, just outside of L.A., we actually border L.A. County, you won't find an Airbnb. They can't do them here; our local regulations don't allow for it. You know, that's a perfect example. And, I mean, California alone has dozens of counties, and within those dozens of counties you have a couple of thousand municipalities that can individually have different laws. And I think one of the things that you've seen, and this is interesting, that I learned earlier this year when we booked a place, the place we booked was in Fullerton, California, which is kind of down near -- sort of, close to Disneyland, in that area. And when that individual property owner, they marketed that space as a great place for, like, a big family reunion that's also close to theme parks, [laughs] obviously, Disneyland is not getting a lot of traffic, so they kind of rebranded how they were doing it, but what I found was that the City of Fullerton actually had no way to regulate that industry, there was not a single written piece of city code for them to be able to use to regulate it. So, they literally couldn't do anything about it. Their City Council was going to be meeting the week after our stay, and it was the No. 1 thing [laughs] on their agenda to identify. So, it's been that wild west, right, because a lot of places haven't regulated it, because there was no reason to. But that's changing. So, that is a big risk factor that's industrywide. Lewis: Yeah. And I think it winds up showing up in a bunch of different ways. I've seen some municipalities put rules on who can offer Airbnbs and they're only allowing it if it's owner-occupied and it's part of the home, or it's a unit within a home that's owner-occupied. And a really big part of that is the fact that -- we were talking about it before, there are these cottage industry businesses that have bought up a bunch of spaces or have entered long-term leases and operate them as Airbnbs, and while that's really great for travelers, if you live in that city what it does is it artificially raises the price of property and puts people that may already be price-squeezed out of neighborhoods, even more so in that position. And so, I think it's a really challenging thing, because we have all these local municipalities, all these jurisdictions, that are handling it slightly differently. And the net effect is, it might be that less properties are available on Airbnb. Hall: I may be one of the most hypocritical people on the planet when it comes to it. You know, I describe myself as exclusive Airbnb user for leisure travel, yet I also recognize there is this enormous -- you know, I'm a little older than you, Dylan, but I think for people your age and a little bit younger that are really looking to try to get into houses, millennials, like this is the time that millennials are buying houses. And affordable housing is a generational problem, there is not enough affordable housing, and it's compounded as these things tend to work out, in some of Airbnbs most interesting, compelling markets. Think about places like Austin, you think about the Bay Area, housing is already incredibly expensive there, those are also the places that you see this cottage industry having formed, of these businesses that buy a bunch of condos in the nicest areas and in the most appealing areas. And so, they immediately soak up more of that residential supply that's already in high demand, and they're exclusively for these short-term Airbnb rentals. So, it's really interesting how this is going to play out; we'll see what happens, but it's interesting. Lewis: Yeah. And if you're thinking about the risk that all of these individual markets pose to Airbnb as a business, it is worth looking at the revenue diversification. Because they do say that, you know, they operate in, like, 100,000 cities, none of those cities are responsible for more than 2.5% of their revenue, so they are spread out wide. I think that the danger for them comes more in someone finding something that's very restrictive and seeing that it works exactly the way that they're planning on having it work, and then other [laughs] cities just saying, well, that looks pretty good, I think we're going to use that same policy. My hunch is that won't happen anytime soon, because the lag on seeing the effects of policy alone will take a while. And really, you know, what we're seeing here with most of the stuff is, we have an innovative idea, we see people use it in this really great way, we see a marketplace emerge that kind of changes the way that everyone thought the rules of engagement worked, and now we need to kind of step in and start putting some rules down. And there's always going to be a bit of a timeline there, there's always going to be some time between the idea happening and us figuring out exactly what the best execution of this thing is for all parties. Hall: Yeah, that's the key. And it is good that they're so diversified. And to your point, I don't think it's likely that a lot of municipalities are going to go backwards, where they've already become entrenched. It's really, really hard to go the other way once those things get established. There is one other risk factor I wanted to point out that I read that it's just worth knowing about. The company is calling out a tax liability risk that could cost the company more than $1 billion in taxes going back to 2013, that could be -- it's still working through the details on that right now, but it could have to cough up more than a $1 billion in its liquidity to cover past tax expenses. So, that's substantial, so that's one of those things you got to kind of be thinking about. Lewis: Yeah, particularly for a business of this size. I mean, I think even with an IPO, what we're talking about in terms of capital being raised here, is in the low single-digit billions. So, talking about that net cash position before, they're going to get some more, but that would be a significant hit to their net cash position. And they're not like, you know, a Facebook or Google [Alphabet] that could take a fine and [laughs] then cover it basically with a quarter's profits, this would be a sizable thing for them to have to deal with. Hall: Yeah, it could be, and another thing that's worth understanding too, is that a lot of their cash, because they've grown so much overseas, almost $1.5 billion of their cash is overseas. So, any domestic expenses that their domestic capital doesn't cover, they would have to repatriate that money and there's more tax implications that come along with that. So, there's complexity, kind of, in their overall financial situation and nuance that's worth at least understanding. Lewis: Jason, we obviously don't know valuation yet, and we won't until shares are available and we see something priced, but how do you look at this business? I mean, is this something that you're watching that is going on the watchlist that you are eager to buy shares of, like, totally ignoring, how are you feeling about it? Hall: You know, I am really, really interested. Again, personally I use the business and I love it. And if there's a business that I use and love and that is growing at a very high rate and is proven to be very disruptive, it's very interesting; it is very, very interesting. The reality of those that, you know, even a great investment is a dumb investment at the wrong price, so that's the thing that I'm watching most closely. I can tell you this, I can tell you somebody that is very interested in this IPO that I've been hearing about constantly for six months, that's our colleague Nick Sciple. Like, I think he might go all-in on Airbnb. Lewis: You know, I love that, because, for folks that don't know Nick well, I think Nick defaults to skepticism. Hall: He does. Lewis: And so, when Nick gets excited about something, I immediately pay attention. Hall: Turns on the lights, really does. Yup. Lewis: [laughs] Yeah. I think for me, Jason, what's really appealing about this is its marketplace. We saw that high gross margin figure. And so, at scale, and bringing some of those expenses down, this could be a very profitable business at some point. There's a lot to like there. I think that the valuation exercise is [laughs] going to be really interesting for them, given how totally out-of-whack their financials have been in 2020. And you know, I mean, there's no certainty about when we'll get back to a period where they're more or less at cruising altitude and starting to get back into some serious growth. And I think that that's a major question mark for the business. So, I mean, if you're watching this company, you're interested in this company and you think that you might be wanting to scoop up some shares early, we say this a lot with IPOs, but I think it's particularly true here with all the uncertainty ahead of this business, it's worth taking a very small position to start. Hall: I agree. And that's most likely what I'll do pretty close to the IPO, is get some skin in the game. But if I could say this, the two metrics I'm going to be paying the most attention to, and it's to your point, are gross margins and revenue growth, because if it can hold those kinds of gross margins and continue to deliver double-digit revenue growth, it's more like a SaaS stock, it's more like a cloud stock, because you see all of the spending into developing that infrastructure to get to critical mass, and then those big losses, and it feels like overnight all of a sudden it starts pumping out these massive amounts of free cash flow. It's just incredible how these businesses, when they scale, how they do this. And I think that's what this could potentially be. Lewis: Yeah. I think during some of its more recent private valuation rounds, we've seen a valuation somewhere in the mid-$30 billion for this company. You know that would put them, based on some of their recent sales figures, at 7X sales. We're obviously going to see them probably priced well above that, but we're not getting into absurd land in valuation as a multiple of sales, even if it winds up going at quite a premium, based on that gross profit number. Hall: Just for some context, Hilton Worldwide Holdings is worth about $29 billion, and Marriott International is worth about $39 billion, so that's kind of where it puts it. And yeah, I don't think that's necessarily an extreme stretch considering how early it is in its business and how much it could continue to scale up. Lewis: Yeah. I think the viability of that really hinges on, OK, what does growth return to when we're back to normal? You know, is it in the 20s, if so, like, it deserves a premium valuation. If they're struggling to bring people in and it winds up being in the teens or low single-digits, then I think that that valuation comes under a lot more pressure. Hall: Yeah. And that's something we won't know for two years. Lewis: [laughs] Yeah. No, I mean, it's the ultimate waiting game debut. And I think some people are probably, honestly, kind of curious that they're even going public. And I wonder how much of that is cash needs and how much of it, frankly, it's just they were going to do it anyway, so they figured we're in a position where we can, we might as well. Hall: I don't think it's about time to do it, I think it's smart. I mean, you think about the amount of cash that the Fed has pumped into the economy, you think about where interest rates are, there's a lot of interest in stocks and this is going to fall right in the sweet spot of the information economy. I think it's smart to do it now. Lewis: Well, Jason, hopefully we'll be able to come back together again and [laughs] talk through some details once we have some firmer details on this issuance and on this stock, but until then, great talking with you, thank you so much for joining me on today's show.

    "article_text":"(Bloomberg) -- Dell Technologies Inc. reported quarterly revenue that topped analysts\u2019 estimates, in a sign of robust demand for the company\u2019s personal computers during the pandemic-fueled work-from-home period. Sales climbed 2.8% to $23.5 billion in the period that ended Oct. 30, the Round Rock, Texas-based company said Tuesday in a statement. Analysts, on average, expected $21.9 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Profit, excluding some items, was $2.03 a share compared with analysts\u2019 average estimate of $1.42. Chief Executive Officer Michael Dell has sought to modernize his namesake company by moving to a subscription-based business model. Dell Technologies is letting clients pay for software and hardware as they go rather than upfront, which will generate more predictable, recurring revenue. The company formed a pact with FedEx Corp. and Switch Inc. earlier this month to develop a U.S.-based private cloud network hosted in FexEx facilities, giving customers an alternative to corporate server farms and public cloud services from Amazon.com Inc. or Microsoft Corp. \u201cWe met unprecedented demand for remote work and learn solutions,\u201d Chief Operating Officer Jeff Clarke said in the statement. Dell shares gained 3% in extended trading after closing at $70.33 in New York. The stock has increased 37% this year. Revenue from consumer PCs jumped 14% to $3.5 billion in the fiscal third quarter, the company said. PC sales to business and government clients increased 5.4% to $8.78 billion. Server and networking sales fell 1.8% to $4.16 billion, while storage hardware revenue declined 7% to $3.86 billion. Sales from VMware Inc., a software maker majority-owned by Dell, rose 8% to $2.89 billion. The publicly traded company offers software for data centers as well as programs that let employees access their corporate systems to work remotely. Dell is considering plans to spin off VMware, but won\u2019t make a decision until after September 2021. \u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P."

It usually occurs after a stock has advanced off of a \u201ccup with handle\u201d or \u201cdouble bottom\u201d pattern. The \u201cflat base\u201d moves straight sideways in a fairly tight price range for at least five weeks and does not correct more than 15%.  Tuesday's breakout also arrived after FedEx swooped higher this year, as the coronavirus pandemic creates a boom in online shopping and residential shipments. And it comes ahead of the crucial holiday shopping season, which will likely rely more on delivery, as physical stores face occupancy limits and customers more likely to stay indoors. Investors could have also taken a position in FDX stock when it bounced off its 10-week line in recent weeks. That line is a key test of investor support. Investors can buy stocks off the first or second rebound from the 10-week line, as long as they are within 10% of that line. Investors could also have used 289.86 \u2014 10 cents above the intraday high on Nov. 18 \u2014 as a quasi-handle entry Tuesday before FDX stock cleared the official buy point. The coronavirus pandemic put those resources to the test, as e-commerce shopping skyrocketed. FedEx COO Rajesh Subramaniam, in September, said that \"The growth that we expected to see over a period of three to five years happened in a period of three to five months.\" Subramaniam said that the holiday season would be \"like no other in our company's history.\" He added that the company would add 70,000 positions in big markets in the U.S., and expand ground facilities, including new automated stations. Stephens analysts who cover FedEx stock said the company could also play a big role in getting a coronavirus vaccine to patients. \"We fully expect FDX will be among the most active participants in COVID-19 vaccine logistics,\" the analysts said in a research note this month. \"We believe the Company has been working with pharmaceutical manufacturers for some time, and believe it will be ready to begin distribution when approval is granted.\" \"Regardless of which vaccine is approved, and the respective cold storage requirements, we believe FDX currently possesses the capabilities and approvals to accommodate those during transport,\" they said.

    "url":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/aws-announces-general-availability-amazon-205300419.html",
    "article_text":"Amazon Managed Workflows for Apache Airflow makes it easy to author, schedule, and monitor data processing and machine learning workflows in the cloud The Pok\u00e9mon Company International, Rocket Mortgage, and GoDaddy among the customers using Amazon Managed Workflows for Apache Airflow  Today, customers are using analytics and machine learning to derive insights from massive amounts of data. To effectively use this data, customers often need to first build a workflow that defines a series of sequential tasks to prepare and process the data. Tens of thousands of customers use AWS Step Functions to visually build and run cost-effective and scalable event-driven workflows that execute tasks across multiple AWS services. There are also customers who want the Apache Airflow orchestration workflow, which has an active open source community, a large library of pre-built integrations to third-party data processing tools like Apache Spark and Hadoop, and the ability to use Python scripts to create workflows. However, using Apache Airflow requires data engineers to install, maintain, scale, and secure the Apache Airflow environments, which adds cost and operational complexity. Furthermore, to support role-based authentication for secure access, Apache Airflow often requires a manual, iterative, and error-prone combination of configuration changes, command-line interface (CLI) commands, and, in some cases, edits to the Apache Airflow code. Customers also must integrate and configure additional tools for alerting for issues like system downtime, workflow errors, and task execution delays. While customers really enjoy the pre-built integrations and familiar Python programming language of Apache Airflow, they want it without the added operational cost and complexity. Amazon MWAA makes it easy for customers to build and execute Apache Airflow workflows in AWS. Amazon MWAA manages the provisioning and ongoing maintenance of Apache Airflow so customers no longer need to worry about patching, scaling, or securing self-managed Apache Airflow implementations. With Amazon MWAA, compute resources that execute tasks are scaled on demand, providing consistent performance for users. Customer data is secure by default as workloads run in customers\u2019 own isolated and secure cloud environments using Amazon\u2019s Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC), with stored data encrypted using AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS). Amazon MWAA makes it easy for customers to combine data using any of Apache Airflow\u2019s integrations, including AWS services and popular third-party tools like Apache Hadoop, Presto, Hive, and Spark, to automate data processing, machine learning pipelines, and software development and operations. Customers can provide role-based access to Apache Airflow\u2019s user interface easily and securely via AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM), providing users Single Sign-On (SSO) access for scheduling and viewing their workflow executions. Amazon MWAA automatically sends Apache Airflow system metrics and logs to AWS\u2019s monitoring service, Amazon CloudWatch, making it easy for customers to view task execution delays and workflow errors across one or more environments without third party tools. With Amazon MWAA, data engineers get the extensibility of Apache Airflow with the scalability, availability, and security of AWS. \"Customers have told us they really like Apache Airflow because it speeds the development of their data processing and machine learning workflows, but they want it without the burden of scaling, operating, and securing servers,\" said Jesse Dougherty, Vice President, Application Integration, AWS. \"With Amazon MWAA, customers can use the same Apache Airflow platform as they do today with the scalability, availability, and security of AWS.\" Customers can launch a new Amazon MWAA environment from the AWS Management Console, CLI, AWS CloudFormation, or AWS SDK, and start running in minutes. Amazon MWAA is available today in US East (Northern Virginia), US West (Oregon), US East (Ohio), Asia Pacific (Singapore), Asia Pacific (Tokyo), Asia Pacific (Sydney), Europe (Ireland), Europe (Frankfurt), and Europe (Stockholm), with more regions to come. The Pok\u00e9mon Company International, a subsidiary of The Pok\u00e9mon Company in Japan, manages the property outside of Asia and is responsible for brand management, licensing, marketing, the Pok\u00e9mon Trading Card Game, the animated TV series, home entertainment, and the official Pok\u00e9mon website. \"Amazon Managed Workflows for Apache Airflow meshes with our security policy by providing single sign-on controlled access through IAM roles and the ability to restrict access to our Amazon Virtual Private Cloud,\" said Eric Smith, Data Platform Engineer at The Pok\u00e9mon Company International. \"With Amazon MWAA, we can focus on building reliable data pipelines that achieve business goals rather than patching and securing instances.\" Detroit-based Rocket Mortgage, the nation\u2019s largest mortgage lender, enables the American Dream of homeownership and financial freedom through an industry-leading, digital-driven client experience. \"Amazon Managed Workflows for Apache Airflow has helped us grow and scale our data science and machine learning workflows with significantly less infrastructure overhead,\" said Dan Jones, Senior Vice President of Data Intelligence for Rocket Mortgage. \"With this new service, our technology teams are able to deliver best-in-class, data-driven solutions faster than ever before.\" GoDaddy is the company that empowers everyday entrepreneurs. With more than 20 million customers worldwide, GoDaddy is the place people come to name their ideas, build a professional website, attract customers, and manage their work. \"Amazon Managed Workflows for Apache Airflow solves one of the biggest operational overheads with orchestration,\" said Jeremy Zogg, Senior Director of Engineering at GoDaddy. \"We have spent a lot of hours setting up, configuring, scaling, and monitoring our on-premises Apache Airflow instances. This was our top challenge for our workflow deployments and we\u2019re excited to migrate and concentrate on what we do best: harnessing the power of data to drive great outcomes for our customers and business.\" About Amazon Web Services  About Amazon Contacts"

Some retailers benefited from consumers' panic buying and stocking-up behavior early in the pandemic. Others, like Best Buy, got a boost as people snapped up computers and other electronic gear to support their ability to work and learn from home. The $2 trillion CARES Act passed by Congress in March provided some of the cash that fueled that spending. Now, as the pandemic rapidly worsens again and threatens to make a return to lockdown measures necessary across much of the country, a combination of renewed panic buying and early holiday shopping is helping drive further robust sales growth for the largest retailers. What happens next is anybody's guess. Image source: Getty Images. But there will be a lot of forces working against that optimism this holiday season. People are still losing their jobs at an elevated rate: The Department of Labor reported 742,000 new unemployment insurance claims for the week that ended Nov. 14, an increase from the previous week. The unemployment situation could get much worse this winter, especially for those industries that have been most deeply affected by the necessities of social distancing. Restaurants that have clung to life throughout the pandemic may finally be forced to throw in the towel, particularly as outdoor dining becomes less viable across much of the country. There's also the issue of housing uncertainty. According to a recent Census Bureau survey, 5.8 million U.S. adults believe they are at least somewhat likely to face eviction or foreclosure in the next two months. As Bloomberg pointed out, that amounts to about one-third of all adults who are currently behind on their rent or mortgage payments. The CDC's nationwide moratorium on many residential evictions expires on Dec. 31. Another round of direct economic stimulus would help people make ends meet, but it's unclear if anything significant will pass Congress before the Biden administration begins on Jan. 20. Even then, a potentially divided Congress could hinder and delay the process. For retailers, it makes a lot of sense to not even attempt to forecast sales this holiday season. While those people who aren't experiencing housing or employment insecurity may be in the mood to spend freely with the end of the pandemic in sight, those whose finances are on rockier ground may be more frugal as they prepare for a tough winter. The National Retail Federation has forecast holiday retail sales growth of 3.6% to 5.2%, but that prediction was based on assumptions that may not bear out. Best Buy, Walmart, and Target have had incredible runs so far this year as their sales soared. That pattern may well continue through the holiday season, but with so many variables in play, investors need to be prepared for just about anything. Stock Advisor launched in February of 2002.

Shopify provides merchants with e-commerce tools for maintaining websites, processing payments, running marketing campaigns, and more. Wayfair sells furniture and home goods online through its eponymous platform, as well as its Joss & Main, AllModern, Birch Lane, and Perigold marketplaces. Shopify went public at $17 per share in May 2015, and the stock now trades at nearly $1,000. Wayfair went public at $29 per share in Aug. 2014, and its stock now trades above $250. Image source: Getty Images. Shopify clearly generated bigger post-IPO gains than Wayfair, but will the high-growth darling continue to outperform the online furniture marketplace over the next few years? Let's dig deeper to decide. Earlier this year, Shopify launched a consumer-facing app called Shop, which unifies its merchants' listings on\u00a0a single searchable platform. That move highlighted its ability to challenge Amazon and eBay\u00a0in unified marketplaces, but Shopify's main competitors are still e-commerce service companies like Adobe's Magento and BigCommerce. Wayfair is the largest online-only retailer of furniture and home goods in America. It works with\u00a0over 12,000 global suppliers to provide over 18 million products across its marketplaces, and it fulfills its orders with a dozen fulfillment centers across North America and Europe. Shopify's revenue rose\u00a047% to $1.58 billion in 2019, as its GPV (gross merchant volume) surged 49% to $61.1 billion. However, its adjusted net income fell 22% to $34.3 million as it ramped up its investments in new services and bought 6 River Systems to strengthen its newly launched Shopify Fulfillment Network. In the first nine months of 2020, Shopify's revenue rose 82% year-over-year to $1.95 billion as the pandemic forced companies to ramp up their e-commerce investments. Image source: Getty Images. Its GMV rose 46% year-over-year in the first quarter, 119% in the second quarter, and 109% in the third quarter. It posted an adjusted net profit of $292 million during the first nine months, compared to a loss of $16 million a year ago, even as it continued to expand its fulfillment network ahead of the busy holiday shopping season. Wayfair's revenue rose 35% to $9.1 billion in 2019, with double-digit growth in both its domestic and overseas businesses. However, its adjusted net loss more than doubled from $366 million to $741 million as\u00a0higher tariffs and marketing costs dragged down its margins. But in the first nine months of 2020, Wayfair's revenue jumped 59% year-over-year to $10.5 billion as the pandemic caused people to make more purchases online. CEO Niraj Shah noted the\u00a0crisis caused customers to \"reprioritize their spending on where and how they live and away from other experiences like travel, entertainment, and dining.\" That robust revenue growth, along with cost-cutting measures and the improved efficiency of its logistics network, enabled Wayfair to generated an adjusted profit of $388 million in\u00a0the first nine months -- compared to a loss of $479 million a year earlier. Analysts expect Shopify's revenue to rise 81% this year and for its adjusted earnings to surge twelvefold. But next year, they expect that growth to cool off with 32% revenue growth and a 4% dip in earnings. Analysts expect Wayfair's revenue to rise 59% this year and for its earnings to stay in the black. Next year, they expect its revenue to rise 13% but for its earnings to decline 46% as the pandemic-related tailwinds dissipate. Assuming those forecasts are accurate, Shopify's stock trades at over 250 times forward earnings, while Wayfair has a forward P\/E ratio of 125. Neither stock is cheap relative to its growth, and both stocks are pricier than Amazon, which trades at nearly 60 times forward earnings. But if I had to pick one over the other, I'd still buy Shopify, because it's better diversified, operates a less capital-intensive model, and generates stronger growth in revenue and earnings than Wayfair. Shopify's expanding ecosystem -- which includes Shopify Payments, Shopify Capital, and its Plus tier for large enterprise customers -- also gives it more directions to expand than Wayfair over the long term.

The investigation is initially taking the form of a preliminary evaluation on the vehicles, specifically the company's 2015 to 2017 Model S sedans and its 2016 to 2017 Model X SUVs. The NHTSA received 43 complaints from consumers who detailed the failure of the left or right suspension fore links.\u00a0 Image source: Tesla Motors.

    "article_text":"What do Elon Musk and Mary Dillon have in common? Both are CEOs who have bought shares of their own companies just before the share prices moved higher.You have probably heard of Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla. In 2013, he made a big statement by buying over a million shares of Tesla stock for $100 million even though he already had plenty of shares.Musk went out on the limb even further, as he had to borrow the money from Goldman Sachs to buy the shares. He used his previous holdings in Tesla, and stakes in other companies, as collateral.Since the May 2013 purchase, shares of Tesla are up over +2,800%.But who is Mary Dillon?She\u2019s the President and CEO of Ulta Beauty, a cosmetics and beauty product retailer with stores across the United States.The CEO of Ulta bought nearly a million dollars of shares on the open market in March 2014 and September 2014.Since the March 2014 purchase, shares are up +188%.Doubling Down in 2019 But these two CEOs didn\u2019t stop there.In 2019, after the shares of both Ulta and Tesla took a dive, both CEOs saw yet another buying opportunity.Dillon, the CEO of Ulta, bought $300,000 worth of shares in September 2019. It was her first open market purchase since the 2014 buys.Musk, Tesla\u2019s CEO, bought $25 million in May 2019.These CEOs were doubling down on their own companies in 2019.And Musk didn\u2019t stop there. In 2020 he was at it again.On Feb 14, 2020, he bought yet another $10 million worth of stock, even though the shares had soared. Tesla\u2019s shares are up another +178% since that purchase.This is a rare insider trading signal: the insider who steps in to buy again.Insider Buying Sends a Strong Signal\u00a0 Why would these two CEOs spend so much of their money on their own companies\u2019 stock, and double down again last year, when they already own a ton shares already?Greed!Pure and simple.The opportunity to make more money motivates people- even people who are already billionaires like Elon Musk.\u00a0Keep reading . . .------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Insider \u201cCluster Buy\u201d Signals Rare OpportunitySuddenly, 3 top officers at an innovative software company dug into their own pockets and bought over $1.6 million in shares of their company\u2019s stock. There\u2019s only one reason: They\u2019re convinced the stock is going up in price. Using a proprietary strategy, we targeted that insider buying spree plus a handful of other compelling stocks with fresh insider purchases. These time-sensitive opportunities are now open to public view \u2013 but only until Sunday, November 29.See Zacks\u2019 hand-picked insider trades now >>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------If top insiders are buying, it\u2019s because they know something very good is going on at the company. Maybe it is a new product. Or contract. Or pending merger.Whatever the reason, they are very confident that shares will be on the rise. After all, who would buy more stock in a company if they knew it was sinking???Buy When the Insiders Buy When high level insiders buy, they are required to report the purchases to the SEC within 48 hours of the trade. The trade then becomes public information.Hedge funds and other professional investors routinely use this information to get an edge on their trades.For most of us, though, it\u2019s not easy to get access to the insider information.\u00a0 While the media will trumpet huge insider buys like Elon Musk\u2019s $100 million purchase, did you hear anything about Mary Dillon\u2019s $300,000 purchase in September 2019?The challenge is getting easy and reliable access to all the insider trades and then figuring out which ones to buy.Where to Find the Insider Buys\u00a0\u00a0Anyone can go on the SEC website and get the insider trading information but it\u2019s time consuming to search by individual companies.Some investment firms collect the insider buying data and can provide it to you as a weekly list. Have you ever seen one of those lists?\u00a0 The sheer number of companies can be overwhelming.In some instances, the insiders have been known to buy en masse. Then what\u2019s an investor to do?This happened during the stock market dip in August 2011. As stock prices fell, insiders felt that their companies were undervalued and rushed out to buy shares.That August, insiders bought stock in 50 different S&P 500 companies in just one week. Even if you got a list of those stocks, how would you narrow it down to the stocks that were truly worth buying?To solve this problem, our Zacks research team developed a strategy that monitors selected insider buying activity at companies that already show strong earnings and excellent valuations. We do the work of sifting through all the insider buys so you don\u2019t have to.Just a handful of stocks meet the demanding criteria of our Zacks\u2019 Insider Trader. Right now, we\u2019ve narrowed it down to 11 insider buys that make the grade \u2013 including a cluster buy we added just a few days ago.Three officers of an exciting software company just invested more than $1.6 million into their company's stock. After a recent pullback, these insiders doubled down, just like Elon Musk and Mary Dillon. Share prices were just too attractive for them to resist.This is an opportunity that's worth looking into!Plus, as a bonus for exploring insider moves like this, you are invited to download Zacks' Special Report, 5 Stocks Set to Double free of charge.

The Nasdaq outperformed as investors favored tech-related, market-leading stocks that have fared well during the pandemic, while economically sensitive cyclical stocks weighed. All three indexes rose for the week, in which the S&P 500 reached a new closing high and the blue-chip Dow ended above 30,000 for the first time ever. \"It's an abbreviated session and volume is light, so the only conclusion is that the rally is not faltering for now,\" said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities in New York. \"It does bode well for next month,\" Cardillo added. \"Will we see a Santa rally? Most likely. Will it be as robust as November? That's a big question mark.\" Retailers opened their doors to Black Friday shoppers, with social distancing practices and other measures put in place to mitigate infection risks, while offering steep discounts. \"Black Friday has been somewhat tarnished - traffic is down due to the pandemic - but the good news is e-commerce sales have reached a new record,\" Cardillo said. \"That's encouraging.\" In the latest development on the road toward developing a vaccine against COVID-19, Britain gave drugmaker AstraZeneca the green light after experts raised questions about the vaccine's trial data. As U.S. hospitalizations for coronavirus set a grim record of more than 89,000, the race for a medical solution to the pandemic has led to promising vaccines from Pfizer Inc, Moderna Inc and others, fueling optimism for light at the end of the tunnel. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 37.9 points, or 0.13%, to 29,910.37; the S&P 500 gained 8.7 points, or 0.24%, at 3,638.35; and the Nasdaq Composite added 111.44 points, or 0.92%, at 12,205.85. Of the 11 major sectors in the S&P 500, healthcare companies enjoyed the largest percentage gains while energy shares had the biggest percentage loss. Chipmaker stocks, which have been resilient throughout the global health crisis, once again outperformed the broader market, with the Philadelphia SE Semiconductor index rising 1.2%. Shares of Walt Disney Co dipped 1.3% after the company said it would lay off about 32,000 workers, up from the 28,000 announced previously. Jobs will be cut mainly at Disney's theme parks. Tesla Inc built on its recent rally, its shares advancing 2.0% even as U.S. regulators opened an investigation into front suspension issues in about 115,000 Tesla vehicles. U.S.-listed shares of iQIYI Inc fell 1.7% after Reuters reported Alibaba Group Holding Ltd and Tencent Holdings Ltd had put on hold talks to buy a controlling stake in the video streaming service. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by a 1.36-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.73-to-1 ratio favored advancers. The S&P 500 posted 23 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 154 new highs and nine new lows. Volume on U.S. exchanges was 6.82 billion shares, compared with the 11.03 billion average over the last 20 trading days. (Reporting by Stephen Culp; Editing by Richard Chang)"

    "article_text":"\n The investigation is centered around potential suspension failures in 2015-17 Model S sedans and 2016-17 Model X SUVs. NHTSA says its preliminary evaluation of 114,761 Model S and Model X vehicles in the U.S. aims to \"evaluate the scope, frequency and consequences of the alleged defect.\" Thirty-two of the complaints NHTSA has received involve failures that occurred during low-speed parking maneuvers. Meanwhile, 11 incidents occurred while driving faster than 10 miles per hour, including four at highway speeds. A similar problem found in U.S.-made Tesla cars exported to China triggered a recall there earlier this month. Instead, Tesla blames the higher rate in China on \"driver abuse\" and that \"driver usage and expectation for damageability is uniquely severe in the China market,\" the letter said. The NHTSA probe comes on the heels of two recalls last week affecting 9,500 Tesla vehicles, where the front and center roof trim on the 2016 Model X could detach while the vehicle is being driven because it may have been improperly adhered. That recall covers 9,136 Model X vehicles produced between Sept. 17, 2015 and July 31, 2016. A second recall affects 401 2020 Tesla Model Y vehicles. In this case, bolts connecting the front upper control arm and steering knuckle may have not been properly tightened, allowing the upper control arm to detach from the steering knuckle, according to the agency report. Tesla said it was not aware of any accidents or injuries tied to either recall.

    "article_text":"\n The ID.3 is selling well in Europe, but VW is mulling a smaller EV to comply with tough EU rules. (\u00a9VanderWolf Images - stock.adobe.com) Under the \"Small BEV (Battery Electric Vehicle)\" project, engineers are racing to develop a smaller all-electric car which priced between 20,000 and 25,000 euros ($24,000-30,000). Volkswagen did not provide details on what the new vehicle might look like, when it might be launched or where it might be built, Reuters said. The Financial Times said the smaller EV won't come out for at least three years. The European Union's more stringent emissions targets are forcing Volkswagen to increase the hybrid and electric share of European sales to 60% by 2030, up from 40% prior. Volkswagen sold 10,475 ID.3s for the month as production of its ID family of electric cars hits full swing at its Zwickau facility.\u00a0 Renault's Zoe sold 9,614 units in October. Tesla sold just 834 Model 3s after a strong September. The German automaker began ID.3 deliveries in September but is not bringing the vehicle to the U.S., where smaller cars are out of favor. It plans the larger ID.4 crossover instead. Tesla is starting to boost capital spending after a long slide, as the EV maker continues work on the Berlin and Austin factories. CEO Elon Musk has made comments over the years about a $25,000 car. This week, Musk again mused about a Tesla hatchback, which presumably would be a more-direct rival vs. the ID.3. But it's not clear that Tesla is actively pursuing either project at this time. Meanwhile, Volkswagen will delay the U.S. launch of its well-received ID.4 electric crossover as it focuses on deliveries in the European market to avoid potential EU fines. Volkswagen postponed the U.S. sales launch of the ID.4 from December to March 2021. The company will prioritize European deliveries to avoid penalties to the EU for failing to meet C02 emission targets. ID.4 deliveries are expected to start in Europe by year end. Chinese deliveries of a made-in-China ID.4 are due early next year. U.S.-based production of ID.4 electric cars is set to start in 2022. But for now, ID.4 vehicles for the North American market are still being built in the German city of Zwickau. In the U.S., the ID.4 First Edition sold out within 8 hours of opening orders. That version starts at $43,995 before incentives and deliveries were expected to begin later this year. Just days ago, the German automaker confirmed a 250-mile EPA rating. Ford is expected to begin deliveries of the Mustang Mach-E crossover SUV by year-end.

(\u00a9 Dave Cutler) The value of publicly traded companies is skyrocketing, rising 13% or nearly $5 trillion just this year alone, says Wilshire Associates. And since the March 9, 2009, low, investors have made $37 trillion. But it's not just one or two down years. The decline in stocks to buy is even more head-turning the further you look back. The number of Wilshire 5000 stocks is down 7% in five years and a breathtaking 50% in 20 years. It's almost staggering to see how much smaller the stock market has gotten over time. During the mid-1990s, investors had more than 7,000 listed publicly traded companies to choose from, says research from Vanguard. The number of companies listed in U.S. markets peaked in 1996, says Davis citing data from the World Bank. And it's been \"in almost continuous decline since then,\" he said. Pinpointing exactly why so many companies are going away is hard. There's no single reason. But analysts and researchers point to several factors, including: Even those numbers pale next to historic levels. In 1996, 677 companies went public, a record, says Jay Ritter, professor of finance at the University of Florida. And nearly 500 companies went public in 1995 and 474 did in 1997. The IPO spigot is slow versus where it was. During the 2010s, 1,174 companies went public. That was down from the 1,299 that went public during the 2000s. Companies benefit from being large, especially in technology. The so-called \"network effect\" means the more people who use your products and services, the more valuable those products and services are to additional users. In this world, the winners take most. So rather than going alone and taking on giants, many companies that would have gone public in the past might simply sell to a larger one. \"In many industries, being big is more important than it used to be, so we have seen a lot of mergers over the past few decades,\" Ritter said. \"A lot of the consolidation has already occurred. But we still see most successful VC-backed startups selling out in a trade sale rather than going public.\" Just this year, Amazon bought five small companies. Microsoft has bought nearly twice that many. Smaller public traded companies often just fall through the cracks. Many lack any sort of research support from Wall Street. What's more, the key reason to go public, raising money, isn't as critical. Companies don't need as much capital as they used to,\u00a0Davis says. As the economy digitizes, new companies' need for capital is a fraction of what it was. Manufacturing is outsourced. Even computer capability is rented. Many companies find they can scale up quickly with a relatively small amount of human and financial capital. Davis points to TikTok, the international social media sensation with hundreds of millions of users. It stays private as it doesn't need much money, he says. Meanwhile, pools of private money are vast, allowing companies to get money they need without the hassle of being public. Facebook didn't go public because it needed money, Davis says. It did so mainly to give employee-shareholders a way to sell after it already grew into a behemoth, as it often the case with tech companies. And this is a good market. The market's rolls contract even more when the IPO market is less hospitable. Just 105 companies went public in 2016, the lightest year for new IPOs in the past 10 years. And that year, the Wilshire 5000 shriveled by 160 stocks. Most of the decline in the number of public companies is due to vanishing microcap companies, Vanguard found. And in times of economic stress, even more companies might slip. During 2001, after the tech-stock bubble, the number of Wilshire 5000 companies dropped by 583, the most on record. The financial crisis also exacerbated the trend; in 2009, the number of companies fell by 470. What's the upshot of this stock market trend? Does it matter if there are fewer publicly traded stocks to buy? Opinions vary. Losing microcap publicly traded companies is practically meaningless, Vanguard found.\u00a0 \"The investable U.S. equity market \u2014 the large-, mid-, and small-cap stocks that reflect investors' investable opportunity set \u2014 has remained a relatively constant proportion of the total U.S. equity market, and it has also maintained a consistent level of concentration among its constituents,\" Vanguard said in its report. What about venture capital partnerships that do buy many smaller promising companies? Those are usually off-limits to ordinary investors. But Ritter says investors aren't missing much. The returns are no better or no worse than publicly traded companies. \"The returns that limited partners have earned since 2006 have not been much different than publicly traded stocks have delivered, partly because of the big fees that the general partners take,\" he said. And publicly traded stock is worth about $30 trillion. That far exceeds the $4 trillion worth of equity owned by venture capital and buyout funds. Plus, investors own some of these private firms secondhand anyway. \"Most of the private equity investors are pension funds and endowments, so individuals indirectly have exposure,\" Ritter said. \"Millennials are coming to the Internet for (stock) information,\" Holmes said. \"Small companies will get a bid.\" The number of daily average trades at Charles Schwab, the largest online brokerage, doubled in the September quarter to 1.5 million. In all of 2020, a year of a pandemic and stock market meltdown followed by a sharp new upturn, daily average trades at Schwab surged 109% to 1.5 million. Nearly 200 companies went public this year using the SPAC method, Renaissance says. That's more than any individual type of IPO. And don't rule out the debut of more publicly traded companies, many attracted by the rich valuations some other IPOs are getting. The Renaissance IPO ETF, which tracks the value of IPOs, is up more than 85% this year. That tops the gains of all the major stock market indexes. Entrepreneurs are noticing. More than 240 companies filed to go public this year. That's up more than 20% from 2019. And the IPO filings include some hotly anticipated stocks like food delivery company DoorDash and home-sharing service Airbnb, Still, the same stock market trend continues, and downward pressure is constant and relentless. In the past eight years, 40% of operating companies that went public are biotech companies. \"There are a lot of listed biotech startups that will either go out of business or get acquired,\" Ritter said. \"There is no reason to expect much growth in the number of public firms,\" Stulz said. \"The most likely outcome is that the number will keep falling at a slow pace with some years that are exceptions.\" The number of stocks in the Wilshire 5000 is shrinking Sources: Wilshire Associates based on Wilshire 5000 Index YOU MAY ALSO LIKE: \n11\/27\/2020\nCheck the Stock Market Today column to spot changes in market trend and track the best stocks to buy and...  \n11\/27\/2020\nCheck the Stock Market Today column to spot changes in...

    "article_text":"(For a Reuters live blog on U.S., UK and European stock markets, click LIVE\/ or type LIVE\/ in a news window.) (Updates to market close, changes dateline, byline) By Stephen Culp NEW YORK, Nov 27 (Reuters) - Wall Street stocks advanced and the Nasdaq closed at a record high on Friday in a holiday-shortened week, as retailers kicked off the year-end shopping season amid record COVID-19 hospitalizations. The Nasdaq outperformed as investors favored tech-related, market-leading stocks that have fared well during the pandemic, while economically sensitive cyclical stocks weighed. All three indexes rose for the week, in which the S&P 500 reached a new closing high and the blue-chip Dow ended above 30,000 for the first time ever. \"It's an abbreviated session and volume is light, so the only conclusion is that the rally is not faltering for now,\" said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities in New York. \"It does bode well for next month,\" Cardillo added. \"Will we see a Santa rally? Most likely. Will it be as robust as November? That's a big question mark.\" Retailers opened their doors to Black Friday shoppers, with social distancing practices and other measures put in place to mitigate infection risks, while offering steep discounts. \"Black Friday has been somewhat tarnished - traffic is down due to the pandemic - but the good news is e-commerce sales have reached a new record,\" Cardillo said. \"That's encouraging.\" In the latest development on the road toward developing a vaccine against COVID-19, Britain gave drugmaker AstraZeneca the green light after experts raised questions about the vaccine's trial data. As U.S. hospitalizations for coronavirus set a grim record of more than 89,000, the race for a medical solution to the pandemic has led to promising vaccines from Pfizer Inc, Moderna Inc and others, fueling optimism for light at the end of the tunnel. Unofficially, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 38.56 points, or 0.13%, to 29,911.03, the S&P 500 gained 9.04 points, or 0.25%, to 3,638.69 and the Nasdaq Composite added 111.44 points, or 0.92%, to 12,205.85. Chipmaker stocks, which have been resilient throughout the global health crisis, once again outperformed the broader market. Shares of Walt Disney Co dipped after the company said it would lay off about 32,000 workers, up from the 28,000 announced previously. Jobs will be cut mainly at Disney's theme parks. Tesla Inc built on its recent rally, its shares advancing even as U.S. regulators opened an investigation into front suspension issues in about 115,000 Tesla vehicles. U.S.-listed shares of iQIYI Inc fell after Reuters reported Alibaba Group Holding Ltd and Tencent Holdings Ltd had put on hold talks to buy a controlling stake in the video streaming service.

    "article_text":"\n The Dow Jones Industrial Average briefly rallied over 100 points to approach record highs early Friday, as Tesla stock raced to another all-time high. Chip giant Advanced Micro Devices is nearing a new buy point, while hot IPO stock Snowflake surged out of a new buy zone. On Friday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.1%, while the S&P 500 gained 0.2%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite outperformed with a 0.9% rise in midday trade. The stock market will close at 1 p.m. ET. Amid the coronavirus stock market rally, the tech-heavy Nasdaq is up 34.8% for the year through Wednesday's close. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 is up 12.3%, while the Dow is up 4.7% year to date, through the Nov. 25 close. The cumulative total of worldwide Covid-19 cases confirmed since the start of the outbreak topped 61.4 million Friday, with more than 1.44 million virus-related deaths. Investors should continue to use the stock market's strength to buy breakouts. Start slowly with new purchases and see how they perform. If they work, then add more exposure. But if breakouts start to fail, then you can back away. The top discount retailer is the No. 5-performing stock on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, advancing 27.8% year to date. A potential handle entry offers a slightly lower buy point, at 87.15. The stock was again trying to move past this early entry in morning trade. Hot IPO stock Snowflake is out of the 5% buy zone above a 301.10 buy point in a cup with handle following Wednesday's breakout. The buy zone goes up to 316.16. Shares surged almost 9% Friday morning, pushing the stock out of the buy zone. On Nov. 18, shares broke out above a 466 buy point in an awkward cup with handle. The 5% buy zone tops out at 489.30, so the stock is well extended. On Friday, Tesla stock set a record high at 597.88 Friday morning. Apple stock continues to trace a new base with a 138.08 buy point. An early entry exists at 125.49. But the top Dow Jones stock is starting to show signs of significant weakness. The blue-chip giant is the No. 1-performing Dow Jones stock for 2020, with a 58.1% advance through Wednesday. Software giant Microsoft moved up 0.9% Friday, moving further above the 50-day moving average line. Shares regained that critical level on Tuesday. Year to date, Microsoft is one of the top Dow Jones stocks, advancing 35.6% through the Nov. 25 close.

    "article_text":"QuantumScape is aiming to commercialize its solid-state lithium metal batteries which it claims provide a greater range, a much faster charge time and are safer and more cost effective than conventional technologies used today. Production of the batteries is several years away with Volkswagen aiming to install them in vehicles by 2025. QuantumScape\u2019s founder and CEO Jagdeep Singh told Yahoo Finance Live, \u201cWe\u2019re really at the cusp for the beginning of this massive transformation\u201d into electrification of vehicles. \u201cWhoever wins the battery battle, so to speak, is going to be looking at, in our opinion, a multi hundred billion dollar company,\u201d said Singh prior to the listing. \u201cWe think that solid state technology is the technology best poised to win this battle over the long run,\u201d he added. Since 2010 the company has been developing its solid-state lithium battery. This is different than conventional batteries which are based on liquid or gel electrolytes - the medium through which lithium-ions move up and down in the battery. QuantumScape batteries replace that liquid with a solid material known as the \u2018solid-state electrolyte\u2019. \u201cBy doing that we can basically get higher energy density, so more range for a given charge, faster charge times - a 15 minute charge, instead of say an hour at best, and a safer operation because the material itself is non-flammable,\u201d said Singh. He believes faster charge times and a 300-500 mile range per charge will put QuantumScape batteries one step closer to competing with gasoline-run vehicles. \u201cThe reason why today's EV penetration stands at 2% instead of a 20% or 80% we believe is because today's batteries just aren't competitive with the combustion engine. And that's what we're competing with this combustion engine, not other batteries,\u201d he added."

Lithium stocks are having a great year, thanks largely to rosy growth projections for electric vehicles (EVs). Lithium is needed to manufacture the rechargeable lithium-ion batteries that power EVs, and it's required to produce energy-storage products, another fast-growing market. Image source: Getty Images. The Global X Lithium & Battery Tech ETF \"invests in the full lithium cycle, from mining and refining the metal, through battery production,\" according to its prospectus. It's not an actively managed fund. Rather, it aims to track the performance, before fees and expenses, of the Solactive Global Lithium Index. The fund's expense ratio is 0.75%, which is relatively reasonable.  The fund had 40 holdings as of Nov. 25 and net assets of nearly $1.3 billion as of the day before. By dollar value, 49% of the holdings were based in China, 21% in the United States, and 11% in South Korea, as of Oct. 31. No other country accounts for more than 5% of total holdings.

BYD, the No. 2 holding, touts that it's \"the world's largest electric vehicle manufacturer.\" It's also a leading maker of rechargeable batteries for many applications. Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway owns a big stake in the company.  Next up is No. 4, Samsung SDI. It produces lithium-ion batteries for a variety of uses and makes electronic materials used in semiconductors and displays. It's followed by LG Chem, which is the world's biggest maker of EV batteries, and has other businesses.  Panasonic, the No. 7 holding, produces electronic products for a range of consumer and industrial applications. It supplies lithium-ion batteries for EVs and energy-storage systems.\u00a0 Tesla, No. 8, has energy-storage and solar-power businesses in addition to its premium EVs. It's probably included in the lithium ETF because it produces lithium-ion battery packs for its energy-storage products and non-China-made vehicles at its Nevada Gigafactory. Panasonic, which supplies the battery cells, is its partner at this location. Lastly, Eve Energy and Contemporary Amperex Technology both make lithium batteries.  The Global X Lithium & Battery Technology ETF seems a solid option for investors who want broad exposure to the lithium space, which has been highly volatile over the long term.\u00a0Keep in mind that like any ETF (or mutual fund), its diversification can be both an advantage and a disadvantage.\u00a0 Stock Advisor launched in February of 2002.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Tesla, Inc. TSLA, JPMorgan Chase & Co. JPM, Comcast Corporation CMCSA, Deere & Company DE, The Gap, Inc. GPS, Nordstrom, Inc. JWN, Oracle Corporation ORCL and The Boeing Company BA. The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features an update on the ongoing Q3 earnings season, in addition to featuring new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Tesla, JPMorgan Chase and Comcast. These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today. You can see\u00a0all of\u00a0today\u2019s\u00a0research reports here >>> Including this morning's results from\u00a0Deere & Co. and last evening's results from\u00a0Gap,\u00a0Nordstrom\u00a0and others, we now have seen Q3 results from 488 S&P 500 members. Total earnings for these companies are down -7.6% on -1% lower revenues, with 84.8% beating EPS estimates and 76.8% beating revenue estimates. This is notably better performance relative to what we saw from this group of companies in the first three quarters of the year. The EPS and revenue beats percentages are the highest in recent years. Importantly, estimates for the current period (2020 Q4) have gone up since the quarter got underway, with the current -11.3% earnings decline up from -13.4% at the end of September. For full year 2020, total S&P 500 earnings are expected to be down -17% on -4.1% lower revenues, with easy comparisons and upward revisions helping 2021 earnings growth reach +21.6%. This approximates to an index 'EPS' of $132.72 in 2020 and $161.39 in 2021.\u00a0 Tesla\u00a0shares have practically been on fire lately, with the stock up 563.8% in the year-to-date period. Driving this momentum is a combination of first-mover advantage in the e-mobility space with high range vehicles, superior technology, and software edge. Robust Model 3 demand, ramp up of Model Y production, Shanghai Gigafactory prospects, amazing line-up of upcoming products and aggressive expansion efforts bode well for the firm. Tesla\u2019s S&P 500 inclusion news has further boosted investors' confidence. However, high R&D, SG&A costs and massive capex may clip the margins. Tesla is investing heavily to boost production capacity and build gigafactories in Berlin and Austin, which are likely to strain its near-term prospects. Waning margins for Model S\/X and lofty valuation of the firm are other concerns. Thus, investors are recommended to wait for a better entry point.\u00a0 (You can\u00a0read the full research report on Tesla here >>>) Shares of\u00a0JPMorgan\u00a0have lost -6.3% over the past year against the Zacks Major Regional Banks industry\u2019s loss of -18.1%. The Zacks analyst believes that branch openings in new regions, acquisition of InstaMed, strong mortgage banking business and focus on credit card operations are likely to continue supporting the bank's financials. Further, despite restriction of capital deployments to conserve liquidity, the company\u2019s cash position remains robust. However, the Federal Reserve\u2019s accommodative policy and near-zero rates are expected to hurt the bank\u2019s interest income and margins. Also, coronavirus-induced economic downturn is likely to continue hampering business activities. Thus, loan demand will be muted in the near term.

The Zacks analyst believes that Comcast is benefiting from solid high-speed Internet customer wins. Its strategy to provide high-speed Internet at an affordable price plays a pivotal role in providing connectivity and improving customer experience. Moreover, coronavirus-led increased media consumption, and work-from-home and online-learning waves bode well for Comcast\u2019s Internet business. Moreover, its streaming service Peacock has gained significant tract within a short span of time and is a key catalyst in driving broadband sales. However, Comcast persistently suffers from video-subscriber attrition due to cord cutting. Theme park revenues are expected to suffer from indefinite closure of Hollywood park. Further, weakness in film business is also a headwind. Moreover, a leveraged balance sheet is a concern.

Oh, and Tesla stock was up 562% since Jan. 1 as of the Nov. 24 close, amid a global pandemic no less. Fractional investing is the practice of buying stock shares in units of less than one, for a proportionally smaller price tag. One-half of a share would cost you 50% of the current stock price, for example, and one-quarter would cost 25%. In the case of Tesla, assuming a current stock price of $550, a half-share would cost $275. One-quarter of a share would be $137.50. The fractions can get much smaller than one-quarter or one-half. Robinhood, an app-based brokerage, allows you to buy shares in units as small as one-millionth of one share with as little as $1. That means you could invest a single dollar in Tesla, which would buy you about 0.001 of a share. Tesla's Model S, X, 3, and Y. Image source: Tesla. Before you dive into fractional investing, it's important to know your brokerage's rules of play. You can't buy fractional shares directly from a stock exchange, and neither can your brokerage. The brokerage makes fractional investing possible by purchasing the shares in whole units and divvying them up according to their customers. That's a workable system, but it adds some nuances to the investing process. For one, the brokerage decides whether you get shareholder voting rights with your fractional ownership. Robinhood does allow you to have votes according to the shares (or fractions of shares) you own. But Stash, another app-based brokerage, only counts your vote if you own at least one full share of the stock. That means you can vote with 1.5 shares in your portfolio, but not with 0.75 shares. The minimum investment is $1 on Robinhood, but $5 with Schwab. Stash allows you to invest any dollar amount, but you need at least $5 to\u00a0open an account. Check with your brokerage on the rules that will apply to you. Beyond voting rights, minimum-buy amounts, and which securities you can purchase fractionally, you also want to know how quickly your buy and sell orders are fulfilled and whether you'll be charged fees on transactions. Fractional investing makes it possible to own a piece of the market's most popular companies on the tiniest of investing budgets. That's a good thing, as long as it doesn't lure you into bad habits. Investing basics still apply, even when you're dealing with small dollar amounts. Said another way, buy Tesla because you researched the company and you believe it has staying power -- not because it feels trendy and it only costs $1. While you're at it, pick another 19 or 20 companies to round out your portfolio. It'll be well worth the $20 you spend. Tesla hasn't disappointed investors too much this year, but you don't know when that could change. Diversifying into other stocks spreads out your risk, which becomes increasingly important as your wealth grows. Stock Advisor launched in February of 2002. Returns as of 11\/28\/2020."

    "article_text":"\n But a key gauge suggests investors are getting too bullish. Dow Jones futures rose 0.25% vs. fair value. S&P 500 futures climbed 0.3%. Nasdaq 100 futures advanced 0.5%. Futures were flat to lower for much of Thursday following the AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine news. However, shares of U.S. tech giants did not seem to be affected. On Friday, U.S. stock market markets will close at 1 p.m. ET. The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration on Friday said it's begun an investigation into 114,761 Tesla vehicles over front suspension safety issues. The NHTSA said the preliminary evaluation will cover 2015-2017 Model S and 2016-2017 Model X vehicles following complaints alleging failure of the front suspension fore links. Earlier this year, Tesla recalled tens of thousands of Model S and Model X vehicles in China over suspension issues. But the company said there was no defect, blaming Chinese drivers for any problems. However, complaints of Tesla's \"whoppy wheel\" has been known for years. Earlier this week, Tesla recalled a small number of Model X and Model Y vehicles for various defects. Tesla stock briefly fell modestly but turned up 1% Friday morning. Nio stock and Xpeng reversed higher, up more than 1%. Li Auto dipped 1.5%. All four stocks have seen huge gains in recent weeks. Bitcoin prices are trading at around $17,000, according to Coinbase, up from Thursday morning's lows. That comes after a massive rally in recent weeks to a two-year high above $19,300 earlier this week. Ethereum and several other cryptocurrencies also retreated. Coinbase CEO Martin Armstrong suggested Wednesday night that Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is attempting to rush out regulation on self-hosted crypto wallets that could hurt use cases for digital currencies. The proposed Facebook Libra digital currency could launch in limited form early next year, the Financial Times reported. Libra would be backed entirely by the U.S. dollar. Coronavirus cases worldwide reached 61.45 million. Covid-19 deaths topped 1.44 million. Coronavirus cases in the U.S. have hit 13.24 million since the epidemic's start, with deaths above 268,000. Deaths topped 2,300 on Wednesday, the most since early May. Soriot still expects the U.K. and European Union to OK the AstraZeneca vaccine by year-end. FDA approval could take longer, as the U.S. arm of the initial late-stage trial is ongoing. The stock market rally finished mixed Wednesday, but growth took the reins. The Dow Jones, S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite are all up about 2% so far this week. Despite the generally positive coronavirus vaccine news and soaring Covid cases, this week there has been a broad advance with stay-at-home and \"real economy\" stocks faring well. Psychological gauges such as bulls vs. bears are secondary indicators vs. the primary indicators of the major indexes and leading stocks. Right now the primary indicators signal a solid stock market rally, though some IPOs are starting to look frothy. The psychological indicators could provide an extra reason to take partial profits on stocks that are greatly extended from moving averages. And, if the market starts to show weakness, such gauges can be useful in deciding how much defensive action to take. Salesforce reportedly is in talks to buy collaboration software maker Slack, according to multiple reports. A Salesforce-Slack deal, which could be announced next week, would be among the biggest software takeovers ever. WORK stock spiked 38% to 40.70, giving it a $23 billion valuation. A Salesforce-Slack deal would step up competition with Microsoft, which competes vs. Slack with its Teams software offering. Microsoft stock edged up 1 cent to 213.87. A Slack deal also could spur more software M&A, especially in the cloud or work-from-anywhere fields. Etsy stock jumped 5.4% to 145.09, breaking a downward trend line. It's also above its old buy point of 141.51. That entry is no longer valid, but it's something to note. The official buy point is 154.98. Shopify stock rose 5% to 1,019.52, retaking the 50-day line and breaking a downtrend, both offering early entries. Another early entry is 1,130.10, with the official buy point 1147.01. However, the RS line for Shopify stock has lagged since early July. Also, SHOP stock has reclaimed its 50-day line several times in the past two months, but quickly retreated below that key level. With Shopify and Etsy stock, the holiday shopping season is huge, but figuring out the winners and losers may not be clear for weeks. PayPal stock rose 4.1% to 214.46, extending this week's strong gains. Shares broke a trend line Monday as they rallied from the 10-week line. On Tuesday, PYPL stock topped a 205.02 alternate entry. Shares hit a record 216.07 intraday before paring gains. That briefly topped the traditional buy point of 215.93 from the not-quite-a-cup base. PayPal's rally has come as the stock is seen as a Bitcoin play, with the digital payments leader embracing the cryptocurrency. If the Bitcoin price ends its big run, that could have an impact on PYPL stock.

Image source: Getty Images. In some ways, it makes sense that Tesla is more valuable than legacy automakers. It's growing faster, isn't bogged down by a dealer network, and generates higher margins. But the price-to-sale and price-to-earnings ratios you see below show that Tesla's valuation is insanely high compared to these companies.\u00a0 The excitement about Tesla's business is understandable. Customers are extremely loyal and love their vehicles. But I think disruption is coming to the auto business long before Tesla lives up to its current valuation, and that's why the stock has run too far, too fast.\u00a0 Several popular EV names in the U.S. aren't yet in production. One that actually does have a product and is on investors' radar is electric-delivery truck maker Workhorse Group.\u00a0 Workhorse's niche is the \"last mile\" box truck for short-distance deliveries. Its two C-Series electric trucks offer 650- or 1000-cubic- foot cargo space, and have 100 miles of range. While there's a good reason for interest in this company, its 2021 production volume target is just 1,800 vehicles.\u00a0 The company has also applied for Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certification for its HorseFly unmanned drone \"that can deliver parcels, carry sensors and cameras and operate autonomously with a high degree of precision.\"\u00a0 While there's reason to like Workhorse for its long-term potential, there are many hurdles, including potential competition, for it to be a successful business. Its valuation today looks well beyond what is reasonable, making it a prime candidate to retrench when investors focus their excitement elsewhere. I'm betting this one has run too far, too fast.\u00a0 That's an incredible haul if you picked up shares of the micro-cap company earlier this year. The problem is, with a market cap now approaching $1 billion, the market is now paying an insanely high multiple for the company's future prospects.\u00a0 As the chart shows, Blink's cash burn rate is accelerating, meaning it will need to raise more cash, and probably relatively soon. With the stock price having raced higher, management would be smart to take advantage of this opportunity to raise cash with a secondary offering -- even with the downside for investors being dilution as a result. Frankly, Blink needs\u00a0to be spending money to build out its business now.\u00a0 But at almost 200 times sales, don't count me among the investors looking to buy shares of the company just yet. The business is just too small, and there's a lot of risk if it doesn't get a secure enough foothold in the EV charging business to deliver on the growth potential. Today's nearly billion-dollar valuation could run out of juice even more quickly than it charged up.\u00a0 The electric vehicle industry is growing, and there's a lot to like long-term. But the automotive industry isn't typically a very profitable industry, and there's a limit to how many vehicles people will buy in a year. That should put some trepidation into the market, and these three stocks could fall back to earth if the growth story is upset in any way.\u00a0 Stock Advisor launched in February of 2002.

Image source: Tesla. You might think it's a big stretch for an electric vehicle company like Tesla to have anything to do with a biotech developing a coronavirus vaccine. Once you understand a few key things about CureVac and Tesla, the connection between the two companies will make sense.\u00a0 Like Moderna\u00a0and Pfizer's\u00a0partner BioNTech, CureVac develops vaccines and therapies based on messenger RNA (mRNA). This mRNA approach holds significant potential in immunizing against infections by multiple types of viruses as well as treating other diseases, including cancer. In 2019 (well before the COVID-19 pandemic struck), CureVac won $34 million in funding from the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) to build a prototype mRNA \"printer.\"\u00a0 The idea was to create a device that could produce mRNA doses for use in regions with viral outbreaks and in hospitals for making personalized medicines. An mRNA printer would be a revolutionary leap forward in fighting viral disease, especially in remote areas. As you might expect, though, there are plenty of technological hurdles to developing the device. That's where Tesla enters the picture. Three years ago, Tesla acquired Grohmann Engineering, a German company that specializes in automated manufacturing. After CureVac received CEPI funding to build a prototype mRNA printer, Tesla Grohmann Automation was the logical partner to turn to for help. So far, CureVac hasn't said very much on how the effort to develop an mRNA printer is going. We'll have to wait and see if Tesla's magic will show up once again by helping the biotech achieve a breakthrough. However, CureVac won't need Tesla's Midas touch to succeed with its bigger story. It's one of only three companies with COVID-19 vaccine candidates currently in phase 2 testing. The other two are Chinese drugmakers. This puts CureVac's vaccine candidate CVnCoV behind only five others in late-stage testing that could be commercialized in major Western markets. CureVac plans to advance CVnCOV into a pivotal phase 2b\/3 clinical study by the end of 2020. If all goes well, the biotech seems likely to become one of the biggest COVID vaccine winners. The company recently lined up an agreement with the European Commission to supply up to 225 million doses of CVnCOV (assuming it secures regulatory approval). The deal includes an option for the EC to buy an additional 180 million doses. Although no financial details were revealed, CureVac likely stands to make several billion dollars in 2021 if CVnCOV is proven to be safe and effective in late-stage testing.\u00a0 CVnCOV can be stored at standard refrigerator temperatures for up to three months and for up to 24 hours at room temperature. This could give it an advantage over vaccines such as Pfizer's and BioNTech's BNT162b2, which must be stored at ultracold temperatures.\u00a0 Success for CVnCOV could bode well for the rest of CureVac's mRNA pipeline. The company is evaluating a rabies vaccine and two cancer immunotherapy candidates in phase 1 clinical studies. CureVac also has several other preclinical programs.

    "headline":"Electric Carmakers Are in a Stock Market Bubble",
    "url":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/electric-carmakers-stock-market-bubble-073017390.html",
    "article_text":"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- The chief executive officer of Volkswagen AG, Herbert Diess, has predicted that within five to 10 years the world\u2019s most valuable company will be a carmaker. Given how much investors have been bidding up the shares of Tesla Inc. and other electric vehicle stocks, it might happen sooner. Tesla\u2019s market value soared past $540 billion this week \u2014 equivalent to 250 times its expected earnings this year \u2014 meaning it\u2019s now the world\u2019s 10th-most valuable listed business, according to Bloomberg data. A trio of New York-listed Chinese electric-vehicle groups \u2014 Nio Inc., XPeng Inc. and Li Auto Inc. \u2014 are worth a combined $154 billion. None of the three is profitable and together they delivered fewer than 30,000 vehicles during the most recent quarter, just over 1% of Volkswagen\u2019s car sales volumes. Arrival Ltd., a U.K.-based electric-bus and van startup that\u2019s poised to go public by merging with a special purpose acquisition company, is valued at almost $16 billion after the SPAC\u2019s shares more than doubled in a week. It won\u2019t start producing vehicles until late next year.(1) The electric revolution is real and the shift away from combustion engines is accelerating. From a climate perspective, it\u2019s great that investors are allocating capital like this. Still, valuations look mighty bubbly. The potential for disappointment is massive, particularly for the newest crop of EV makers that are yet to generate meaningful revenue. Like all financial bubbles, this one is driven by dreams of enormous wealth. Elon Musk has overtaken Bill Gates as the world\u2019s second-richest person. Scottish investment manager Baillie Gifford & Co., an early Musk backer, recently cashed out billions of dollars in Tesla stock but retains a 3.7% holding worth about $20 billion. Baillie Gifford has more than one horse in the EV race: Its Nio stake is worth almost $6 billion. The Chinese company\u2019s U.S-listed shares have surged 1,235% this year. Nio\u2019s recent history shows the perils of electric-vehicle stocks. It warned in March of substantial doubt in its ability to continue as a going concern, having burned through $4 billion of cash in three years. It survived thanks to a local government bailout. Tesla has been on the cusp of bankruptcy at least twice since 2003. Those now joining the electric race claim to have learned lessons from these near-death struggles but there\u2019s little to suggest their fates will be any less volatile. Competition is intense and while electric motors are simpler to build than combustion engines, developing a vehicle that\u2019s safe, reliable and exciting is incredibly difficult. Incumbent giants such as Volkswagen and General Motors Co. are much better capitalized and they\u2019ve far more experience managing supply chains and building brands. After a slow start, they\u2019ve gone \u201call-in\u201d on EVs. They won\u2019t be shoved aside easily. Several factors have driven electric-vehicle stocks to these giddy heights. The U.S. Federal Reserve has stoked a speculative frenzy by cutting interest rates to zero, and bored millennials trading stocks at home on Robinhood have caught the EV bug. Electric-vehicle companies know how to market themselves to this crowd: Workhorse Group Inc. says its delivery vans can be paired with a drone, while XPeng emphasizes its autonomous-driving capabilities. ElectraMeccanica Vehicles Corp.\u2019s \u201cSolo\u201d model has just three wheels. Then there\u2019s 2020\u2019s hottest financial fad: SPACs. Many have merged with electric-vehicle groups, and one peculiarity of these deals is that the companies are allowed to publish detailed multi-year financial forecasts, unlike in a regular initial public offering. These projections are often extremely bullish. Like Arrival, Fisker Inc. \u2014 an asset-light electric-auto business whose shares have soared \u2014 is yet to commence commercial sales. Even Musk is worried about SPACs, though he hasn\u2019t said which ones. These new companies claim to have a solution for the manufacturing difficulties and massive capital outlays that almost sank Tesla. Drawing a comparison with the way Apple Inc. outsources phone production to Foxconn Technology Group, Fisker plans to subcontract manufacturing of its Ocean SUV to Canadian auto-parts supplier Magna International Inc. Electric- and hydrogen-truck maker Nikola Corp. is pursuing a similar strategy with partners GM and CNH Industrial NV. Others are taking a different approach. Electric-pickup startup Lordstown Motors Corp. acquired a factory from GM and has licensed technology from Workhorse to speed its market entry. Not to be outdone, Arrival claims to have reinvented the car assembly line. It plans to construct smaller, cheaper \u201cmicrofactories\u201d situated closer to where products are sold. Greater automation will reduce the need for human labor, it says. However you produce vehicles, though, there\u2019s plenty to trip you up. More than a third of Workhorse\u2019s factory staff have had to down tools because of suspected coronavirus infections. Li Auto recalled all 10,000 electric SUVs produced before June, after it found a potential suspension problem. Workhorse and XPeng both warned recently of battery supply bottlenecks. A big test for wannabe Teslas will come when they\u2019ve burned though their cash and need to ask equity and debt investors for more, as Tesla and Nio have done repeatedly. ElectraMeccanica warned in its latest accounts that its \u201cability to continue as a going concern will depend on our continued ability to raise capital on acceptable terms.\u201d All of this may have short sellers licking their lips, but Tesla\u2019s rise shows the danger of betting against the bubble. Nikola was the subject of a scathing report from Hindenburg Research that questioned its technology, and which forced the departure of its chairman. Yet its market capitalization now exceeds $11.5 billion. Diess may be right about carmakers becoming the most valuable companies. It\u2019s inevitable, however, that some won't make it. (1) Basis of calculation: the transaction at $10 a share valued Arrival's equity at $6 billion. Shares of the CIIG Spac are now trading at $26.

That was the whole point of Unocoin, their crypto token exchange. But the police were suspicious of the new-fangled \u201cATM.\u201d A lot has changed since then. Unocoin, which just raised financing from Tesla Inc.-backer Tim Draper\u2019s Draper Associates, is flourishing, together with other Indian blockchain ventures. India\u2019s share of person-to-person virtual-currency trading in Asia has surged to 33%, the same as in China, according to Oslo-based Arcane Research\u2019s analysis of volumes on Paxful and LocalBitcoins, the biggest platforms for transactions in the region. Some of this is no doubt due to the bubbly rise this year in Bitcoin, which recently came within $100 of its all-time high after surpassing $19,000 for the first time since 2017. Even after Thursday\u2019s wobble, prices have still more than doubled this year.But fundamental factors are also at play. Sending money to India in a tokenized form, and thus avoiding hefty bank charges, is becoming an option. Some customers of digital-asset exchanges, probably tech-savvy freelancers, receive tokens at regular intervals as payment for their work and convert them into rupees via their local bank accounts. Families in India are using the same channel to send money to students overseas. Having the world\u2019s largest diaspora \u2014 and more than $100 billion in two-way money flows last year \u2014 isn\u2019t the only thing. Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s disastrous ban on 86% of the country\u2019s currency in November 2016 shook Indians\u2019 faith in fiat money. Add the fear of leaving spare cash in banks when three major deposit-taking institutions have crumbled in the past 15 months. No wonder Arcane expects Indian crypto volumes to overtake China\u2019s. The domestic asset management industry is also helping adoption of crypto \u2014 by its incompetence. Most large-cap fund managers have struggled to beat their benchmarks, especially in recent years. The Nifty 50 index has returned only about 2% annually in dollar terms over the past decade. Yet, as Bloomberg Intelligence\u2019s Gaurav Patankar and Morgan Barna have shown, lack of performance hasn\u2019t kept managers from pocketing high fees. Disgruntled younger savers are taking note, and dipping their toes in U.S. exchange-traded funds. At 1%, international allocation is still tiny, the Bloomberg Intelligence analysts say, but it\u2019s growing rapidly. Ditto for crypto-investing, even though holding a highly volatile digital asset over the long term isn\u2019t for the faint of heart. Only 600 of Unocoin\u2019s 1.2 million customers have started a systematic buying plan to invest (mostly) in Bitcoin. But 99.5% of them are sitting on profit, and must be bragging about it to their friends. There\u2019s one dampener: regulation. Nobody wants a return to 2018, when the Reserve Bank, the monetary authority, instructed banks not to entertain customers who dealt in virtual currency. The draconian approach nearly strangled India\u2019s blockchain revolution. The action against Unocoin\u2019s kiosk in Bangalore was like the heavy hand of the state crashing down on a kids\u2019 lemonade stand. If folks in India\u2019s technology capital couldn\u2019t pay cash to buy digital tokens, then the asset was effectively being banned nationwide. In hindsight, the founders\u2019 ordeal with the police proved to be a blessing in disguise. Young entrepreneurs joined together, went to the Supreme Court in New Delhi and got the RBI\u2019s direction to banks declared unconstitutional. That was in March. Already, the exchange has seen a fivefold jump in trading, averaging $150,000 a day, from $30,000 before the court\u2019s verdict. Of late, trading is much higher, thanks to the rally in Bitcoin prices. Larger bourses such as CoinDCX were witnessing daily volumes of almost $700,000, when I last checked. The players are urging the government to bring digital assets under the existing money-laundering law, which will give the industry legitimacy. The next step would be to regulate the tokens as money or securities, depending on their use. Read About: The End of Banking as We Know It India\u2019s phlegmatic bureaucracy may wonder if this is all a craze. Perhaps not. It isn\u2019t even unique to Indian Millennial and Generation Z consumers. Wringing the global banking industry dry of its exorbitant fees, and putting more purchasing power in people's hands after the Covid-19 pandemic, will be a worldwide goal. In their study titled, \u201cWhat We Must Do to Rebuild,\u201d Deutsche Bank AG economists are advising companies and policy makers to design alternatives to credit cards and \u201cremove middleman fees.\u201d In the short run, conventional fintech will help, but in the longer term, major economies will all do this by replacing cash with their own central bank digital currencies. That\u2019s when older consumers will join in. If they don\u2019t, they\u2019ll get get stuck, and not just figuratively. Automatically triggered crypto \u201csmart contracts\u201c will make it possible for self-driving cars to switch lanes faster than others. Commuters will be continuously paying one another in official digital currencies \u2014 or in stablecoins like Facebook Inc.\u2019s proposed Libra, private tokens whose values are fixed against fiat money.

    "url":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/tesla-tsla-recalls-more-9-130501808.html",
    "article_text":"Tesla Inc. TSLA has filed a safety recall for more than 9500 Model X and Y SUVs in the United States with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) due to manufacturing defects.Reportedly, the company has recalled 9,136 Model X SUVs built in 2015 and 2016 over chunks of the body that could get disconnected while driving due to the absence of primer and 437 Model Y SUVs over a possibly loose bolt that could cause separation of the upper control arm from the steering knuckle.Per the company, no accidents have been reported yet due to the manufacturing issues.In Model X, the car is equipped with a front and spine applique, both of which are cosmetic in nature. Both appliques are fixed to the vehicle using urethane. If the applique-to-urethane interface lacks primer, then there is a fear that the applique would get disconnected from the vehicle .This could result in the trim on the roof of the vehicle to fall off while driving at high speeds and become hazardous for other vehicles. The issue was detected by the red-hot electric maker (EV) after the pieces were found missing on few Model X SUVs.\u00a0An investigation was initiated on Sep 21, when Tesla\u2019s Field Quality team became aware of an event involving a 2016 Model X with a missing applique. On Oct 28, the company discovered that the failed components did not have sufficient primer at the urethane-to-applique interface, resulting in the separation of the applique. The Field Quality team then started a review of production records and supplier process information for proof on the application of primer. On Nov 10, Tesla concluded that a defect exists for certain Model Xs. The company will apply a retention test to the potentially affected cars, and reapply primers and adhesives such that the applique attaches securely.Tesla estimates Model X SUVs produced between Sep 17, 2015, and Jul 31, 2016, to have been affected by this inadequacy. Owners of the defected vehicles will be contacted by the company to bring in their vehicles for service.This is not the first incident where roof attachments have created hindrances for Tesla. There was a recent incident where a Model Y had its entire roof came off due to lack of applied seal.The second, smaller recall for Model Y from the 2020 year consists of bolts which might not have been tightly secured in the vehicle. This could result in a serious threat of the upper control arm getting detached from the steering knuckle, impacting the driver\u2019s ability to steer the car.\u00a0On Nov 1, the Field Quality team became aware of two vehicle repairs where the upper control arm had detached from the steering knuckle. The repairs were reviewed and an investigation into the primary cause was initiated, during which a third vehicle repair was recognized. On Nov 10, Tesla determined that a safety-related defect exists.In order to repair the situation, Tesla made certain changes to its production process. The affected Model Y owners are being notified about the malfunction.The California-based automaker previously recalled 123,000 cars from its Model S fleet due to a power steering problem.Tesla is the market leader in battery-powered electric car sales in the United States. Other renowned automakers making aggressive efforts toward an electrified future are General Motors GM, Ford F and NIO Inc. NIO.Tesla currently carries a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold).

These stocks have been among the top-performing options in the market -- investing in any one of them before the 2016 election would've made you rich. Let's take a closer look and see if they're still poised for more growth under Joe Biden, or if investors should consider cashing out and capturing their gains today. Image source: Getty Images. Shares of telehealth stock Teladoc are up over 1,000% during Trump's presidency, but many of those gains came this year, during the coronavirus pandemic. Entering 2020, the stock was up around 400% since the 2016 election. As more patients utilized telehealth visits this year, growing demand for Teladoc's services made it a hot buy in recent months. Through the first nine months of this year, Teladoc reported total visits of 7.6 million, a year-over-year increase of 163%. Sales of $710.6 million during that time were up 79%. The coronavirus pandemic has been the catalyst behind Teladoc's growth this year. But I think that Joe Biden could accelerate the adoption of telehealth even further. The new president plans to spur the use of telehealth for specialty care and mental health with federal funding. In particular, Biden is looking to make it easier for veterans in rural areas to receive remote care. An expansion of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) is also on the agenda -- something that Trump has been less than been eager to do during his presidency.  While Teladoc may not grow at the same explosive rate that the company experienced this past year, there's still a lot of growth left for Teladoc, especially now that its merger with chronic care management company Livongo Health is complete. That will be sure to open up many more opportunities, including patients with diabetes who use Livongo's services to help manage the condition. There is currently a 25% overlap between the patients who use Teladoc and Livongo, so there is plenty of market left for the services to capture.  Another company that's been soaring in recent years is Square. It offers convenient readers and terminals that make it easy for people to accept credit and debit without worrying about monthly fees.\u00a0Much like Teladoc, Square has been growing since 2016. But the real surge came during the pandemic, as the need for cashless payment grew and people spent more and more money online. One area where Square has seen significant growth has been through Cash App. The app makes it easy to transfer money between individuals but it can also be used for investing and to buy bitcoin. In the company's third quarter earnings for the period ending Sep. 30, which Square released on Nov. 5, the Cash App generated $2.1 billion in revenue, growing at a rate of 574% year over year. The growth related to bitcoin has been so significant that without the virtual currency, the Cash App's revenue would've totaled just $435 million.  Bitcoin has been the big driver for Square's business, and it will be key in determining the path of the stock next year. The price of the cryptocurrency is up 150% this year and has been rising since this month's election. President Trump hasn't exactly been a supporter of digital currencies, although he also hasn't been able to stop their growing popularity this year either.  It's unclear how Biden's policies may affect the market for bitcoin (and like with Trump, perhaps they won't at all), but crypto traders don't appear to be concerned with the change in leadership as they have been buying up bitcoin since the election. If the popularity of digital currencies continues to rise, Square could be a big benefactor, and its stock will likely build off the success it's achieved in recent years. One of the hottest stocks of 2020 has undoubtedly is electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer, Tesla. Not only are its number of deliveries up, but the company is no longer unprofitable and sports a bottom line that's been in the black for five straight periods. The company's stock is finally going to join the S&P 500 Index in December. Vehicle deliveries during the period ending Sep. 30 totaled 139,593, which was a year-over-year increase of 44% while its production numbers of 145,036 were up 51% from the same quarter last year. Even during the pandemic, Tesla's done a remarkable job of growing. Its year-to-date revenue of $20.8 billion is 21% higher than the $17.2 billion that Tesla brought in during the same period last year. But that's still a drop in the bucket compared to Ford Motor\u00a0which has posted $106.9 billion in auto sales thus far in 2020, up 29% year over year.\u00a0General Motors\u00a0hasn't had as great of a year with its sales down 20% over the same period, but its year-to-date automotive revenue of $74.6 billion is still more than triple Tesla's top line. The cutting edge tech company still has a long way to go to find itself competing with the sales of long-time industry leaders.  But with improved results this year, investors have been bullish on Tesla's stock; the automaker's share price has risen more than 580% in 2020. Under Biden, Tesla looks to be an even surer buy. The new president will be focused on cleaner energy, plans to create new jobs in the auto industry, to hopes to \"position America to be the global leader in the manufacture of electric vehicles.\" Stock Advisor launched in February of 2002.

    "article_text":"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Hopes that vaccines will soon replace economic lockdowns as our best defense against the coronavirus have stirred speculation that value stocks will regain favor among investors. A guy who until recently oversaw $1.6 trillion has a strong argument that growth stocks will continue to be a better investment. Hiro Mizuno was chief investment officer of Japan\u2019s Government Pension Investment Fund for five years until the end of March. Now a Tesla Inc. board member and special adviser to Japan\u2019s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, here\u2019s what he tweeted at the weekend: Pitting the disruptive vision of entrepreneurs against the hopes of uncovering a real find amid the clutter of beaten down stocks provides a compelling way to frame the debate about whether growth stocks, classified as shares of companies with accelerating revenues, can keep outpacing value stocks, equities whose value is deemed not to reflect some measure of underlying worth. It seemed like the equation might be changing. Value stocks enjoyed a renaissance this month when vaccine euphoria prompted investors to rotate into shares trashed as the pandemic crimped the global economy. Their returns beat their growth counterparts by five percentage points in the first three weeks of November. That\u2019s sparked talk of a global revival. On Tuesday, Bank of America Corp. strategist Savita Subramanian recommended U.S. financial and energy stocks as her top two \u201cunapologetically cyclical and value-focused\u201d sectors. Strategists at Barclays Plc, led by Emmanuel Cau, on Wednesday recommended investors in European shares should overweight value versus growth. And John Woods, Credit Suisse Group AG\u2019s Asia Pacific CIO, said Asian value stocks will outperform in the next six months provided a vaccine becomes widely available. So could it finally be value stocks\u2019 turn in the sun? Investment advisers who\u2019ve called for a reversal of that trend have been proven wrong time and again. In the chart above, the biggest stocks in the Bloomberg Value Index include investment bank JPMorgan Chase & Co., telecoms operator AT&T Inc. and energy company Exxon Mobil Corp. The growth index is dominated by the FAANGS: Facebook Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Apple Inc., Netflix Inc. and Google\u2019s parent, Alphabet Inc. The picture doesn\u2019t change no matter the time period. So far this year, growth stocks have gained about 24%, while value stocks are down by 5%. In the past 12 months, growth is up by 28%, value down by 2.5%. Over three years, growth delivers 66% versus just 12% for value. And since early 2007, when the index histories begin, growth is up more than fourfold while value has a bit more than doubled in value. But hope for value stocks seems to spring eternal. A net 24% of investors overseeing $526 billion expect value to outperform growth the coming year, according to Bank of America\u2019s November survey. That\u2019s the most bullish call for value in the monthly poll since February 2019. Mizuno says that investment style fails to capture disruptors that sacrifice earnings early on to build a dominant market share. Jeff Bezos\u2019s Amazon is probably the best example of that kind of company. \u201cGrowth investing for me is to bet on the ability of CEO and his\/her staff to deliver more than people (including myself) can imagine,\u201d Mizuno also tweeted. By contrast, trying to identify value stocks takes a cocky \u2014 and risky \u2014 self-assurance that the wisdom of the investing crowd has missed something fundamental about a company\u2019s worth. If a share is cheap, it\u2019s probably cheap for a reason. You could even stretch the argument to cover the recent enthusiasm for Bitcoin versus gold. As my colleague Lionel Laurent recently pointed out, the digital currency barely figures in buying and selling in the real world and yet its gains have rapidly outpaced the yellow metal this year.Gold has real-world applications that make it inherently valuable, but many investors still view it as nothing more than a pet rock, limiting the potential universe of buyers. To its fans, Bitcoin represents a transformative technology with the potential to dislodge fiat currencies as a means of payment. In effect, it\u2019s a bet on the future of finance with a side wager that its momentum will continue apace \u2014 like a disruptive growth stock. The current enthusiasm for value stocks may well have further scope to run. But in the longer term, the trend that\u2019s been your friend seems likely to persist. Even once the pandemic is over, backing entrepreneurs will prove more profitable than buying allegedly undervalued equities in the hope that mean reversion will rescue them from the bargain basement.

    "article_text":"(For a Reuters live blog on U.S., UK and European stock markets, click LIVE\/ or type LIVE\/ in a news window.) * U.S. weekly jobless claims unexpectedly rise * Tesla extends rally despite recall * Indexes: Dow down 0.58%, S&P off 0.16%, Nasdaq up 0.47% (Updates with closing prices) By Stephen Culp NEW YORK, Nov 25 (Reuters) - The S&P 500 index closed lower on Wednesday as mounting U.S. layoffs in the wake of new mandated lockdowns to contain surging COVID-19 infections dampened investor risk appetite. The index and the Dow Jones Industrial Average retreated from record closing highs, pulled lower by cyclicals and small caps that drove the rally earlier in the week. Pandemic-resilient tech and tech-adjacent market leaders helped keep the Nasdaq afloat. \"It's a growth day, flipping back the other way away from value,\" said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment strategist at Inverness Counsel in New York. \"It's this ongoing struggle between the virus and the vaccine.\" \"There's a reality setting in that while the vaccine will start being distributed fairly quickly, the virus isn't go away quickly and therefore the timeline for economic improvement is getting pushed out.\" A wide range of data released in advance of Thursday's Thanksgiving holiday was dominated by a second consecutive week of unexpected jobless claims increases, suggesting that new restrictions to combat spiking coronavirus cases could hobble the struggling labor market's recovery. \"The economic data is not good, and we know it won't be good for some time given this new wave of the virus,\" Ghriskey added. The market appeared to be replaying the previous two weeks, which began with rallies driven by promising vaccine news but pivoted back to stay-at-home plays on near-term pandemic realities and lack of new fiscal stimulus. Still, the vaccine developments and removal of uncertainties surrounding the U.S. presidential election have driven Wall Street indexes to record closing highs, and put the S&P 500 on course for its best November ever. Market participants believe U.S. stocks have more room to climb. A recent Reuters poll showed analysts believe the S&P 500 will gain 9% between now and the end of 2021. The index has surged about 66% since the coronavirus-led crash in March and is up about 12% so far this year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 173.77 points, or 0.58%, to 29,872.47; the S&P 500 lost 5.76 points, or 0.16%, to 3,629.65; and the Nasdaq Composite added 57.08 points, or 0.47%, at 12,094.40. Of the 11 major sectors of the S&P 500 seven ended the session in the red, with energy suffering the largest percentage loss. The economically sensitive banking sector lost ground, with the S&P 500 Banks index shedding 0.7%. Tesla Inc, which surpassed $500 billion in market capitalization on Tuesday, extended its gain by 3.4% even after the electric-car maker recalled about 9,500 vehicles. The company also plans to start manufacturing electric vehicle chargers in China starting next year, according to documents it submitted to Shanghai authorities. Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by a 1.24-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.01-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P 500 posted 15 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 120 new highs and eight new lows. Volume on U.S. exchanges was 10.76 billion shares, compared with the 11.17 billion average over the last 20 trading days. (Reporting by Stephen Culp; Editing by Richard Chang)"

In terms of composition, Yellen would likely advocate for stronger federal support in a number of areas \u2013 extending federal unemployment insurance programs and reinstituting additional benefits; funds for small businesses which could allow firms to take out a second PPP loan; targeted relief to industries at the epicenter of the crisis like airlines; support for state and local governments whose budgets have come under substantial strain from the crisis; and funds to beef of the health response and support schools. BUT: As we have noted, however, Biden\u2019s and Yellen\u2019s ambitions in these areas will face binding political constraints that have so far hampered negotiations. In particular, Senate Republicans are likely to remain opposed to a fiscal package significantly above $500 billion. As such, agreement will likely require focusing on a narrower bill in the near-term that will help to support the economy as Covid trends continue to deteriorate and also serve as a bridge to the availability of a vaccine next year. On this point, Bernstein\u2019s recent comments indicate that speed should take a priority over size in passing fiscal legislation in the near-term, a pragmatic point that we believe Yellen would agree with. She could therefore command an important role in breaking the political gridlock by convincing Democrats to reduce their asking price for the fiscal package size in order to deliver swifter \u2013 and much needed \u2013 relief. \u2014 Here\u2019s where markets stood as of midday: \u2014 \u2014 New-home sales in the U.S. held up in October, remaining near the best pace since 2006 and well above pre-pandemic levels, the latest sign that record-low mortgage rates are underpinning robust buyer interest.Purchases of new single-family houses dropped 0.3% from September to a 999,000 annualized pace from an upwardly revised 1.002 million rate, government data showed Wednesday. \u2014 The data \u2014 which essentially show that consumers are spending more than they\u2019re earning \u2014 is reflective of a weak labor market, and appears to defy sentiment numbers that show consumers are growing gloomier. \u2014 Here are main moves in markets as of 9:30 a.m. ET: \u2014 \u2014 Here were the main moves in equity markets, as of 7:30 a.m. ET: \u2014 Here were the main moves in equity markets, as of 6:40 p.m. ET Tuesday: \u2014"

    "article_text":"\n The factory, which will be located near its plant in Shanghai, will have the capacity to make 10,000 chargers, Reuters said, citing documents Tesla filed with Chinese authorities. Tesla also noted it expects to complete building the factory in February. Currently, Tesla imports the chargers from the U.S. and has said it plans to expand its charging network to offer better service. Tesla's Shanghai vehicle factory aims to produce 150,000 Model 3 sedans this year, though sales in China were 13,000 last month and the company has started exporting vehicles to Europe. As a result, the adhesion may weaken over time, and one or both pieces of the trim can separate from the vehicle while it's being driven. This recall covers 9,136 Model X vehicles produced between\u00a0Sept. 17, 2015 and July 31, 2016. In the filing to the agency, Tesla stated it became aware of the problem on Sept. 21, prompting an investigation of the root cause. Tesla will inspect the recalled vehicles and apply a retention test. If needed, Tesla will apply primer to fix the problem. Tesla said it recently learned of three vehicle repairs where the upper control arm had separated. The automaker said it would inspect vehicles for proper torque and adjust if necessary. Additionally, Tesla said it was not aware of any accidents or injuries tied to either recall. The recall of the Model X and Model Y follows another big one last month. On Oct. 23, Tesla recalled 50,000 vehicles in China for unsafe front and rear suspension. In February, 15,000 Tesla vehicles were recalled for steering issues. But the company's biggest recall came in 2018, when 123,000 vehicles were recalled for a power steering issue.

    "article_text":"The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features an update on the ongoing Q3 earnings season, in addition to featuring new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Tesla (TSLA), JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Comcast (CMCSA). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today. You can see\u00a0all of\u00a0today\u2019s\u00a0research reports here >>> Q3 Earnings Seasons Scorecard Including this morning's results from Deere & Co. (DE) and last evening's results from Gap (GPS), Nordstrom (JWN) and others, we now have seen Q3 results from 488 S&P 500 members. Total earnings for these companies are down -7.6% on -1% lower revenues, with 84.8% beating EPS estimates and 76.8% beating revenue estimates.  This is notably better performance relative to what we saw from this group of companies in the first three quarters of the year. The EPS and revenue beats percentages are the highest in recent years. Importantly, estimates for the current period (2020 Q4) have gone up since the quarter got underway, with the current -11.3% earnings decline up from -13.4% at the end of September.  For full year 2020, total S&P 500 earnings are expected to be down -17% on -4.1% lower revenues, with easy comparisons and upward revisions helping 2021 earnings growth reach +21.6%. This approximates to an index 'EPS' of $132.72 in 2020 and $161.39 in 2021.\u00a0 Tesla\u00a0shares have practically been on fire lately, with the stock up 563.8% in the year-to-date period. Driving this momentum is a combination of first-mover advantage in the e-mobility space with high range vehicles, superior technology, and software edge. Robust Model 3 demand, ramp up of Model Y production, Shanghai Gigafactory prospects, amazing line-up of upcoming products and aggressive expansion efforts bode well for the firm. Tesla\u2019s S&P 500 inclusion news has further boosted investors' confidence. However, high R&D, SG&A costs and massive capex may clip the margins. Tesla is investing heavily to boost production capacity and build gigafactories in Berlin and Austin, which are likely to strain its near-term prospects. Waning margins for Model S\/X and lofty valuation of the firm are other concerns. Thus, investors are recommended to wait for a better entry point.\u00a0 (You can\u00a0read the full research report on Tesla here >>>) Shares of JPMorgan have lost -6.3% over the past year against the Zacks Major Regional Banks industry\u2019s loss of -18.1%. The Zacks analyst believes that branch openings in new regions, acquisition of InstaMed, strong mortgage banking business and focus on credit card operations are likely to continue supporting the bank's financials. Further, despite restriction of capital deployments to conserve liquidity, the company\u2019s cash position remains robust. However, the Federal Reserve\u2019s accommodative policy and near-zero rates are expected to hurt the bank\u2019s interest income and margins. Also, coronavirus-induced economic downturn is likely to continue hampering business activities. Thus, loan demand will be muted in the near term. (You can\u00a0read the full research report on JPMorgan here >>>) Comcast\u00a0shares have gained +32.5% over the past six months against the Zacks Cable Television industry\u2019s rise of +26.4%. The Zacks analyst believes that Comcast is benefiting from solid high-speed Internet customer wins. Its strategy to provide high-speed Internet at an affordable price plays a pivotal role in providing connectivity and improving customer experience. Moreover, coronavirus-led increased media consumption, and work-from-home and online-learning waves bode well for Comcast\u2019s Internet business. Moreover, its streaming service Peacock has gained significant tract within a short span of time and is a key catalyst in driving broadband sales. However, Comcast persistently suffers from video-subscriber attrition due to cord cutting. Theme park revenues are expected to suffer from indefinite closure of Hollywood park. Further, weakness in film business is also a headwind. Moreover, a leveraged balance sheet is a concern.

Oracle (ORCL) Gains from Strong Adoption of Cloud Solutions Per the Zacks analyst, Oracle benefits from solid adoption of its cloud-based offerings including NetSuite ERP and Fusion ERP. Strategic Mergers Aid Boeing (BA), Low 737 Deliveries Hurt Per the Zacks analyst, strategic mergers made by Boeing, such as overtaking KLX, boosts growth. However, low 737 deliveries as a result of the worldwide grounding of 737 Max jets raises concerns. LNG Focus, Strong Production Portfolio Aid TOTAL (TOT) Per the Zacks analyst TOTAL's focus to develop LNG assets globally and its strong production growth through new startups is going to boost its performance. Online Growth to Fuel TJX Companies (TJX), High Costs a Woe Per the Zacks analyst, TJX Companies (TJX) is set to keep gaining from robust efforts to boost online sales. Eylea, Dupixent Fuel Regeneron (REGN), Competition Worrisome Per the Zacks analyst, label expansions of drugs like Eylea and Dupixent and uptake of Libtayo fuels Regeneron. Its efforts to develop its pipeline are positive but competition for Eylea is a concern. Wide Market Reach & New Product Development, Aid Eaton (ETN) Per the Zacks analyst, the development of new products through ongoing R&D investments will continue to drive demand and boost profitability for Eaton. Welltower's (WELL) Liquidity Aids, Earnings Dilution a Woe Per the Zacks analyst, while large-scale dispositions will enhance Welltower's liquidity and de-lever its balance sheet, the dilutive impacts on near-term earnings from such asset sales are worrisome. Robust Season Pass Program to Drive Vail Resorts (MTN) Per the Zacks analyst, a strong season pass for the 2020\/21 North American ski bode well for Vail Resorts. Notably, 850,000 passes for the upcoming North American ski season were sold through Sep 18. Solid Demand Environment Aids A. O. Smith Corporation (AOS) Per the Zacks analyst, strength in A. O. Smith's North America segment, driven by robust demand for water treatment and residential water heater products in the United States will lend momentum to it. Fortive (FTV) Battered by FX Volatility & Higher Expenses The Zacks analyst believes that increasing fluctuations in foreign currency rates will continue to hurt Fortive. Also, higher expenses and end market cyclicality issues remain concerns. Weaker Steel Prices to Weigh on Cleveland-Cliffs (CLF) Per the Zacks analyst, weak U.S. steel prices, partly due to subdued demand, will hurt Cleveland-Cliffs' pellet price realization rate and dent its margins. High Operating Expenses Ail Air Transport Services (ATSG) Per the Zacks analyst, a surge in operating expenses due to a rise in costs on salaries, wages, and benefits are limiting the company's bottom-line growth."

    "article_text":"By Noel Randewich (Reuters) - If you traded a stock in the past week, there's a fair chance it was Tesla. Shares in the electric car maker led by CEO Elon Musk rose almost 3% on Wednesday and have now surged 40% since Nov. 16, when it was announced Tesla would join the S&P 500 in December. Investors rushed to buy shares ahead of index funds that will be forced to acquire over $50 billion of its shares. One of Wall Street's most loved - and hated - stocks, Tesla was already the U.S. stock market's most traded companies by average daily value, but trading has surged in recent sessions, along with Tesla's stock price. \"It's been crazy. Since Tesla's (announced) inclusion in the S&P, you've had a lot of managers out there that didn't own enough of it having to buy more,\" said Sahak Manuelian, managing director of trading at Wedbush Securities, in Los Angeles. Retail investors using apps like Robinhood are also responsible for much of the recent volume spike, Manuelian added. GRAPHIC: Tesla is Wall Street's most traded stock, https:\/\/graphics.reuters.com\/USA-STOCKS\/TESLA\/xegpbqwawvq\/chart.png Traders bought and sold an average of nearly $26 billion of Tesla shares per session over the five days ending on Tuesday, accounting for almost 8% of all stock traded on U.S. exchanges, according to Refinitiv data. That is more than the combined value of trades in Amazon.com Inc and Apple Inc over the same period. At about halfway through Wednesday's session, traders had exchanged $20 billion worth of Tesla shares, according to Refinitiv. Up over 400% in 2020, Tesla has become by far the world's most valuable automaker, despite production that is a fraction of Toyota Motor Corp, Volkswagen or General Motors Co. Over the past year, Tesla has averaged over $16 billion a day in trades, followed by Apple, at about $14 billion, according to Refinitiv data. Trading in Chinese electric vehicle maker NIO Inc has also surged in recent weeks, with its shares nearly doubling in November. Including NIO, trading of stocks in the nascent electric vehicle industry reached an average of $38 billion a day in the past five sessions, accounting for 12% of all trading on U.S. exchanges. By comparison, traders in the same period bought and sold each day about $8 billion worth of oil and gas stocks including Exxon Mobil and Chevron.

While the more extensive recall is for a largely cosmetic problem, the other is a serious safety issue that increases the risk of a crash. The product testing service dinged the Model S and Y over issues that have become increasingly well known to owners. The Tesla Model 3 is the only Tesla that Consumer Reports still recommends. Image source: Tesla. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), Tesla became aware of a quality control problem involving appliques on the roof of its Model X cars that could come loose and fall off over time because they were improperly prepped for attachment. While not a safety issue, the wayward appliques could cause a road hazard, so Tesla voluntarily initiated the recall to correct the problem. For the Model Y, though, the NHTSA said there is a problem with the bolts connecting the front upper control arm and steering knuckle that hadn't been properly tightened. That could lead to the control arm becoming detached, which would inhibit a driver's ability to steer, increasing the risk of a crash. Stock Advisor launched in February of 2002.

    "article_text":"(For a Reuters live blog on U.S., UK and European stock markets, click LIVE\/ or type LIVE\/ in a news window.) * U.S. weekly jobless claims unexpectedly rise * Tesla extends rally despite recall * Indexes: Dow down 0.66%, S&P off 0.34%, Nasdaq up 0.25% (Updates to afternoon, changes dateline, byline) By Stephen Culp NEW YORK, Nov 25 (Reuters) - Wall Street was mixed on Wednesday as surging layoffs in the wake of a new round of shutdowns to contain spiraling COVID-19 infections dampened investor risk appetite. The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average retreated from record closing highs, pulled lower by cyclicals and small caps that drove the rally earlier in the week. Pandemic-resilient tech and tech-adjacent market leaders helped keep the Nasdaq afloat. \"Days like we're seeing today on the heels of strong growth is a response to the ebb and flow of the market,\" said Matthew Keator, managing partner in the Keator Group, a wealth management firm in Lenox, Massachusetts. \"It's natural to see some profit-taking as people look at valuations and take money off the table.\" A wide range of data released in advance of Thursday's Thanksgiving holiday was dominated by a second consecutive week of unexpected jobless claims increases, suggesting that new restrictions to combat spiking coronavirus cases could hobble the struggling labor market's recovery. The market appeared to be replaying the previous two weeks, which began with rallies driven by promising vaccine news but pivoted back to stay-at-home plays on near-term pandemic realities and lack of new fiscal stimulus. Still, the vaccine developments and removal of uncertainties surrounding the U.S. presidential election have driven Wall Street indexes to record closing highs, and put the S&P 500 on course for its best November ever. \"The move this month speaks to not only clarity regarding the election uncertainties but also the potential for new stimulus that is out there, an extremely accommodative Fed and tremendous amount of pent-up demand from the consumer's standpoint,\" Keator added. Market participants believe U.S. stocks have more room to climb. A recent Reuters poll showed analysts believe the S&P 500 will gain 9% between now and the end of 2021. The index has surged about 66% since the coronavirus-led crash in March and is up about 12% so far this year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 197.14 points, or 0.66%, to 29,849.1, the S&P 500 lost 12.24 points, or 0.34%, to 3,623.17 and the Nasdaq Composite added 29.74 points, or 0.25%, to 12,067.06. Of the 11 major sectors of the S&P 500, energy suffered the largest percentage loss. The economically sensitive banking sector lost ground, with the S&P 500 Banks index shedding 1.1%. Tesla Inc, which surpassed $500 billion in market capitalization on Tuesday, extended its gain by 2.4% even after the electric-car maker recalled about 9,500 vehicles. The company also plans to start manufacturing electric vehicle chargers in China starting next year, according to documents it submitted to Shanghai authorities. Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by a 1.27-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.03-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P 500 posted 14 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 106 new highs and five new lows. (Reporting by Stephen Culp; Editing by Richard Chang)"

    "article_text":"We love it when a famous CEO buys a large chunk of his company\u2019s stock.In 2013, Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla, bought over a million shares of Tesla stock for $100 million even though he already had plenty of shares.In June and October 2018, he was at it again with another two purchases totaling $35 million in shares.As recently as February 2020, before the Coronavirus Crisis hit the United States, he bought another $10 million at $767.All of these purchases made headlines.When Elon Musk bought in 2013 and 2018, he was the only insider at Tesla buying at that time.\u00a0\u00a0In Feb 2020, Oracle Executive Chairman, and a Tesla director, Larry Ellison, also bought shares. But he was a rare second insider to buy at Tesla in the last few years.Insiders Buying En Masse But what about when non-famous insiders buy their company\u2019s stock and when a bunch of them buy en masse?This mass insider buying behavior is called a \u201ccluster buy\u201d and it is the strongest signal you can get in insider trading.When one insider buys, he might be considered an optimist, especially when he\u2019s the CEO, but when four or five insiders all buy at the same time?Now that\u2019s a powerful consensus.But you\u2019re not going to hear about the cluster buys from the media. There aren\u2019t going to be headlines trumpeting the buys of a few corporate Directors and a CFO.Nope. The cluster buy simply isn\u2019t glamorous enough.Investors therefore have to dig below the surface to find the insider cluster buys. But once you do, that\u2019s where big rewards can be found.\u00a0Cluster Buying Sends the Strongest Signal\u00a0 Why do insiders spend so much of their money on their own companies\u2019 stock when they already own a ton of shares already? Greed!Pure and simple.The opportunity to make more money motivates people- even people who are already well off like highly paid CEOs and CFOs.When insiders buy in a cluster, it\u2019s because they all know something very good is going on at the company. Maybe it is a new product. Or contract. Or pending merger. Whatever the reason, they are all very confident that shares will be on the rise.After all, who would buy more stock in a company if they knew it was sinking?\u00a0 And why would there be several of them buying unless they didn\u2019t collectively believe that their stock was a value?When things at the company are THAT good, insiders don\u2019t want to miss out when everyone else is cashing in. Call it insider peer pressure, if you will.Continue reading . . .------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Insider \u201cCluster Buy\u201d Signals Rare OpportunitySuddenly, 3 top officers at an innovative software company dug into their own pockets and bought over $1.6 million in shares of their company\u2019s stock. There\u2019s only one reason: They\u2019re convinced the stock is going up in price.Using a proprietary strategy, we targeted that insider buying spree plus a handful of other compelling stocks with fresh insider purchases.

That is an enormous cluster buy.By April 2019, shares had spiked 37% off the Dec 24, 2018 lows.And what about now in 2020?Shares of the energy E&Ps crashed in the coronavirus sell-off, including Matador Resources. But while the shares are up big off their lows, they are still down 36% in 2020.And what are the insiders doing?In November 2020, 6 insiders including the CEO, the COO of Operations and 4 directors, dove in to buy again.Shares have rallied 25% in the last month.What do they know? Buy When the Insiders Buy\u00a0 When high level insiders buy, they are required to report the purchases to the SEC within 48 hours of the trade. The trade then becomes public information.Hedge funds and other professional investors routinely use this information to get an edge on their trades.For most of us, though, it\u2019s not easy to get access to the insider information.While the media will tout the huge insider buys from celebrity CEOs like Elon Musk\u2019s October 2018 $10 million purchase, you\u2019ll almost never hear about the non-celebrity CEOs, or other top ranked officers when they buy their stocks.Was anyone talking about the recent Matador cluster buy?The challenge is getting easy and reliable access to all the insider trades and then figuring out which ones to buy.Where to Find the Cluster Buys\u00a0Anyone can go on the SEC website and get the insider trading information, but it\u2019s time consuming to search by individual companies.Some investment firms collect the insider buying data and can provide it to you as a daily list. Have you ever seen one of those lists?\u00a0 The sheer number of companies can be overwhelming.And those lists don\u2019t usually separate out the cluster buys, which sometimes take place on different days in the same week.For example, if you\u2019re getting daily insider updates, you may not realize that the CEO bought on Monday but three directors bought on Tuesday. You may pass by those \u2018hidden\u2019 cluster buys without even realizing it.Even if you got a list of the cluster buyers, how would you narrow it down to the stocks that are truly worth buying? If I\u2019m going to buy when the insiders are buying, I want to buy only their top picks.Insider Buying You Don't Want to Miss\u00a0 To identify the most promising signals, Zacks' research team developed a strategy that monitors selected insider buying activity at companies that already show strong earnings and valuations.Today only 11 stocks meet the demanding criteria of our Insider Trader portfolio.We invite you to look into the portfolio now. You'll see live recommendations, including a fresh cluster buy at a software company. After a recent pullback, 3 insiders scooped up more than $1.6 million worth of shares. You can still buy this stock at a significant discount, but maybe not for long.As a bonus for exploring this and our other insider picks, you can download Zacks' Special Report, 5 Stocks Set to Double, free of charge.

Slack is set to report October quarter earnings on Dec. 2.

    "article_text":"\n The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 200 points, as Tesla stock briefly fell from record highs on a vehicle recall. Chinese electric vehicle stocks Li Auto, Nio and Xpeng Motors tumbled on a Chinese government investigation. Nikola plunged as much as 17% in morning trade. On Wednesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.6%, while the S&P 500 lost 0.3%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite outperformed with a 0.1% rise in midday trade. Amid the coronavirus stock market rally, the tech-heavy Nasdaq is up 34.1% for the year through Tuesday's close. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 is up 12.5%, while the Dow is up 5.3% year to date, through the Nov. 24 close. The cumulative total of worldwide Covid-19 cases confirmed since the start of the outbreak topped 60.2 million Wednesday, with more than 1.4 million virus-related deaths. Investors should continue to use the stock market's strength to buy breakouts. Start slowly with new purchases and see how they perform. If they work, then add more exposure. But if breakouts start to fail, then you can back away. The cloud software company is the No. 1-performing stock on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, advancing 60.4% year to date. A potential handle entry offers a slightly lower buy point, at 87.15. The stock was again trying to move past this early entry in morning trade. Li Auto skidded 9% in morning trade, while Nio stock tumbled 3.7%. Xpeng Motors sold off 9.6%. On Nov. 18, shares broke out above a 466 buy point in an awkward cup with handle. The 5% buy zone tops out at 489.30, so the stock is well extended. On Tuesday, Tesla stock set a record high at 565.00. Nikola stock is nearly 70% off its 52-week high. Apple stock continues to trace a new base with a 138.08 buy point. An early entry exists at 125.49. But the top Dow Jones stock is starting to show signs of significant weakness. The blue-chip giant is the No. 2-performing Dow Jones stock for 2020, with a 56.9% advance through Tuesday. Software giant Microsoft moved up 0.3% Wednesday, moving further above the 50-day moving average line. Shares regained that critical level on Tuesday. Year to date, Microsoft is one of the top Dow Jones stocks, advancing 35.6% through the Nov. 24 close.

    "article_text":"Investors interested in stocks from the Automotive - Domestic sector have probably already heard of Paccar (PCAR) and Tesla (TSLA). But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks? Let's take a closer look. Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities, but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank. The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends, while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits. Paccar and Tesla are sporting Zacks Ranks of #2 (Buy) and #3 (Hold), respectively, right now. The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates, so investors should rest assured that PCAR has an improving earnings outlook. But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors. Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels. The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics. These include the long-favored P\/E ratio, P\/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company's fair value. PCAR currently has a forward P\/E ratio of 24.28, while TSLA has a forward P\/E of 254.97. We also note that PCAR has a PEG ratio of 2.43. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P\/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. TSLA currently has a PEG ratio of 7.75. Another notable valuation metric for PCAR is its P\/B ratio of 3.08. The P\/B ratio is used to compare a stock's market value with its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, TSLA has a P\/B of 31.17. These are just a few of the metrics contributing to PCAR's Value grade of B and TSLA's Value grade of F. PCAR has seen stronger estimate revision activity and sports more attractive valuation metrics than TSLA, so it seems like value investors will conclude that PCAR is the superior option right now."

    "article_text":"(Bloomberg) -- The rapid rally in electric vehicle stocks that helped double the market value of some companies within a week, came to a halt on Wednesday. The buying frenzy in these companies -- many of which began attracting investor interest earlier this year -- accelerated after S&P Dow Jones Indices said on Nov. 16 industry front-runner Tesla Inc. will be added to the benchmark S&P 500 Index in December. Tesla\u2019s stock rose 36% between the announcement and Tuesday\u2019s close, pushing its market valuation over $500 billion. Shares fell 1.8% Wednesday. Gravity finally seems to be catching up, with most of the stocks trading lower on Wednesday morning. Shares of Nikola Corp. dropped as much as 17%, the most intraday since September, after its Chief Executive Officer Mark Russell appeared on Jim Cramer\u2019s \u201cMad Money\u201d show on CNBC Tuesday night. Russell didn\u2019t offer any new details on the company\u2019s ongoing partnership talks with General Motors Co. JPMorgan analyst Paul Coster said he was skeptical about the company\u2019s Badger pickup truck, given the CEO has been consistently non-committal about the initiative and also since it is not a strategic interest for Nikola. Both GM and Nikola have said the talks are ongoing without offering much detail on the pact, which is a major catalyst for the EV startup\u2019s shares. Other big declines in the sector came from Workhorse Group Inc., ElectraMeccanica Vehicles Corp., XPeng Inc., Li Auto Inc. and Ayro Inc., all of which fell more than 8%. The big outlier of the day is Fisker Inc., which largely sat out the broader rally before, but gained as much as 25% on Wednesday, after Citi analyst Itay Michaeli initiated coverage on the stock with a buy. The analyst noted that as a prerevenue company, Fisker is a higher-risk investment proposition, but praised its long-term potential. Shares of the company had declined 6.6% since Nov. 16 through Tuesday, while the stocks of the rest of the industry were on fire.

The Labor Department's report showed initial claims for state unemployment benefits last week increased to 778,000 from 748,000 in the prior week. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 730,000 applications. With the next fiscal stimulus package now expected only after President-elect Joe Biden is sworn in on Jan. 20, momentum in the labor market is expected to remain slow. \"The question is who wins the battle - the vaccines or the rising cases in the short term,\" said Christopher Grisanti, chief equity strategist at MAI Capital Management in Ohio. \"For the last several weeks, the market has been looking through bad news, but then you get the statistic about the unemployment claim and the market focuses again on the short term difficulties we are having.\" Data also showed U.S. consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of domestic economic activity, increased solidly in October, but personal income fell. At 10:20 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down, or 0.49%, at 29,900 after closing above 30,000 for the first time on Tuesday. The S&P 500 was down 0.27%, while the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.11%. Six of the 11 S&P indexes were lower, with the energy and financial sectors leading declines, while technology mega-caps were among the biggest gainers in early trading. Trading volumes were expected to be thin ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday on Thursday. Major U.S. banks JPMorgan Chase & Co and Goldman Sachs Group, among the most economically-sensitive, were down 1.9% and 1.5%, respectively. Hopes of a COVID-19 vaccine following promising trial data from three major drugmakers as well as a smooth White House transition have lifted Wall Street's main indexes to record highs and set the benchmark S&P 500 on course for its best November ever. Market participants said they expected U.S. stocks to climb even higher, with a recent Reuters poll showing the S&P 500 is poised to rise 9% between now and the end of 2021. The index has surged about 66% since the coronavirus-led crash in March and is up about 12% so far this year. Tesla Inc, which crossed $500 billion in market capitalization on Tuesday, dropped 1.1% as the electric-car maker recalled about 9,500 vehicles. Declining issues outnumbered advancers 1.85-to-1 on the NYSE and 1.67-to-1 on the Nasdaq. The S&P index recorded 11 new 52-week highs and no new low, while the Nasdaq recorded 59 new highs and four new lows. (Reporting by Shriya Ramakrishnan in Bengaluru; Editing by Arun Koyyur)"

Tesla, which now sells its Model 3 electric cars in China and plans to deliver its Model Y sport utility vehicles in 2021, plans to invest 42 million yuan ($6.4 million) in a new factory to make its third generation of quick chargers, known as the Supercharger V3, it said in a statement. The factory will be near its car plant in Shanghai. China, which offers hefty subsidies for electric vehicles as it seeks to cut down on pollution from petrol or diesel cars, has been expanding its nationwide network of charging points, one of the biggest challenges to encouraging adoption of EVs. The factory, which Tesla expects to complete in the first quarter next year, will have capacity to make 10,000 chargers a year, Tesla said. Tesla, which sold more than 13,000 vehicles in China in October, said it would expand research capabilities in Shanghai.

    "article_text":"\n Dow Jones futures and S&P 500 futures fell early Wednesday, while Nasdaq 100 futures rose modestly after the Dow Jones Industrial Average made history Tuesday. Nio and Tesla set all-time highs, while Apple rebounded. Hot IPO stocks Corsair Gaming and Palantir Technologies continued their recent surges. The Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 1.5%, or 454 points. The S&P 500 rallied 1.6%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite moved up 1.3%. The Dow Jones industrials topped the 30,000 level for the first time in history. Amid the coronavirus stock market rally, the tech-heavy Nasdaq is up 34.1% for the year through Tuesday's close. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 is up 12.5%, while the Dow is up 5.3% year to date, through the Nov. 24 close. The cumulative total of worldwide Covid-19 cases confirmed since the start of the outbreak topped 59.9 million Tuesday, with more than 1.4 million virus-related deaths. The cloud software company is the No. 1-performing stock on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, advancing 60.4% year to date. Chinese rival Nio advanced as much as 3.3% Tuesday before reversing sharply lower. The stock snapped a three-day win streak. The stock set a record high Tuesday, reaching an all-time high at 57.20. On Nov. 18, shares broke out above a 466 buy point in an awkward cup with handle. The 5% buy zone tops out at 489.30, so the stock is well extended. Hot IPO stocks Corsair Gaming and Palantir Technologies surged to more all-time highs Tuesday, as their torrid runs continued. Palantir Technologies skyrocketed 13.2%, closing more than 100% above an 11.52 buy point in an IPO base. Similar to Corsair Gaming, it would be prudent to lock in at least some gains. According to Leaderboard commentary, \"Palantir Technologies is extended as it continues to rocket to new highs. It was cut to a quarter position Tuesday to lock in some profit.\" Apple stock continues to trace a new base with a 138.08 buy point. An early entry exists at 125.49. But the top Dow Jones stock is starting to show signs of significant weakness. The blue-chip giant is the No. 2-performing Dow Jones stock for 2020, with a 56.9% advance through Tuesday. Software giant Microsoft moved up 1.8% Tuesday, as the stock regained its 50-day moving average line. Shares fell below that critical support level last week. Year to date, Microsoft is one of the top Dow Jones stocks, advancing 35.6% through the Nov. 24 close. Investors should continue to use the current stock market strength as a signal to buy new breakouts. Start slowly with new purchases and see how they perform.

    "url":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/tesla-recall-9-136-model-114509605.html",
    "article_text":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Tesla Inc is issuing two recalls covering about 9,500 vehicles for roof trim that may separate and bolts that may not have been properly tightened. The larger recall covers 9,136 Model X cars from the 2016 model year, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said https:\/\/static.nhtsa.gov\/odi\/rcl\/2020\/RCLRPT-20V710-9316.PDF on Wednesday. NHTSA said the front and spine cosmetic roof trim may have been adhered without first using primer, and one or both pieces of trim may separate from the vehicle while it is being driven. Tesla said in documents filed with the agency it learned in September of an event involving a 2016 Model X that prompted a company investigation into the root cause and frequency of the condition that could create a road hazard for motorists behind the vehicle. Tesla will inspect the recalled vehicles and apply a retention test. If they fail, Tesla will apply primer to remedy the condition. The other recall covers 401 2020 model year Tesla Model Y vehicles with bolts connecting the front upper control arm and steering knuckle that may not have been properly tightened. Due to the inadequate tightening, NHTSA said the upper control arm could detach from the steering knuckle. Tesla said it recently learned of three vehicle repairs where the upper control arm had separated. It said vehicles would be inspected for proper torque and if necessary, would be adjusted. Tesla said it was not aware of any accidents or injuries tied to either recall.

Image source: Tesla. Tesla has a lot of metrics that investors watch from quarter to quarter. Delivery figures are probably the most important, typically coming out in the first days of each new quarter. Earnings reports obviously carry substantial weight as well. With all those catalysts behind us for the current quarter, the amount of fundamental news affecting Tesla between now and the end of the year is likely to be small. That leaves the stock price more susceptible to factors that don't involve Tesla's business strength. The sheer mass of money following the S&P 500 is incredible. S&P Dow Jones Indices reports that $11.2 trillion in assets uses the S&P 500 as a benchmark for return comparison purposes. Of that amount, more than 40% -- $4.6 trillion -- are indexed assets that are tied directly to the S&P 500's components. Based on Tesla's current market capitalization, estimates suggest that it will likely have a weighting of between 1% and 1.5% of the S&P 500. Take that amount and apply it to the $4.6 trillion in S&P-tracking assets, and you get $46 billion to $69 billion in Tesla stock that index funds will have to buy come late December. That amount is so huge that S&P Dow Jones has looked at spreading out Tesla's inclusion over a couple of days. No final decision has been made on that front, but breaking up the move could make it easier for those forced buyers to find willing sellers. The other thing to keep in mind is that Tesla already has many investors betting against its stock. As of the end of October, nearly 48 million shares of Tesla stock -- worth more than $25 billion at current prices -- were sold short. That represented 5% of shares outstanding. If index-related buyers end up pushing the stock price higher, the resulting squeeze on short-sellers could lead to an even sharper upward move. Admittedly, after the big gains in Tesla shares this year, anyone selling the stock short has to be prepared for huge risk, and so they're less likely to get squeezed out than most short-sellers would. Nevertheless, there's only so much short-selling investors are willing to lose. That could leave the stock open to a big short-term bump as well. Stock Advisor launched in February of 2002.

Tesla has plans to use its new structural battery pack technology in Model Y vehicles it will make in Berlin but the company has said it would use battery cells made at its pilot factory in its European Model Y, noted Electrek. One million vehicles per year could be manufactured with 100 GWh capacity in Berlin when the plant\u00a0reaches its maximum capacity. However, the same cells could also be used in semi-trucks, which need 10 times more battery cells than a run of the mill electric car or for other applications, as per Electrek.\u00a0 Price Action: Tesla shares closed 6.43% higher at $555.38 on Tuesday and rose 1.26% to $562.40 in the after-hours session.

    "article_text":"And the auto industry disruption tie-ins are many, varied\u2026 and potentially lucrative. From new EV startups and batteries or fuel cells \u2026 To ride-sharing with an ESG twist and car subscription companies that are challenging our ideas of ownership. The ideas are racking up, and the growth runway potentials are phenomenal. EV startup NIO (NYSE:NIO) has gained over 1500% this year. EV charging stock Blink (NYSE:BLNK) has gained 1400% YTD. Now, mergers and consolidations are now the name of this game as all the tie-ins fight for market share. Food delivery\u2014another mobility tie-in\u2014is in a state of all-out war for market share. The Biggest Change Yet Is Coming To Transportation As a part of the clean energy transition, the world is racing to roll out the next era of transportation: electric vehicles. But there\u2019s yet another disruption happening in the industry\u2026. Not only will conventional gas-powered vehicles in time be on the chopping block\u2026the entire concept of owning a car may be on the verge of extinction sooner than you think. And Facedrive is among the first movers in this surprising new market. But make no mistake about it \u2013 it will be a trend that upends the entire automotive sector. This is where Facedrive\u2019s acquisition of Steer really comes into its own. Steer is a new all-inclusive, monthly, risk-free car subscription service that is 100% electric, plug-in, and hybrid. And it is predicting that transportation is ready for another round of evolution\u2026 The success of subscription-based \u2018leasing\u2019 models is already well documented, and this simple concept could be at the core of the next major disruption in the auto industry. We\u2019ve already seen it with electric bikes and scooters\u2026 But this step could change everything. Imagine being able to have a clean, convenient, quality-controlled electric vehicle personally delivered to you whenever you needed it\u2026. Without the hassle of maintenance or insurance. And it\u2019s affordable. Better yet, you aren\u2019t investing in something that immediately loses its value as soon as you drive it off the lot. It\u2019s one answer to the last remaining hurdle of full-on adoption of EVs. And unlike leasing a car\u2014there\u2019s no mileage limit. And the growth runways are phenomenal when you consider that 70% of Steer members have never even driven an EV before. That means that these are new converts. Anyone who couldn\u2019t afford to ride an EV before, can now, with Steer. But it\u2019s a diverse collection that allows users to drive pretty much any EV, hassle-free, including an Audi e-Tron or a Hyundai Kona, both new all-electric SUVs with ranges of over 250 miles. Source: Audi.com Food: The $26B Shared Mobility Vertical It saw where things would go wrong for Uber, which completely ignored sustainability. Then Facedrive launched an ESG coup: They were the first to offer customers an EV option, and then to plant trees to offset their carbon footprint. Then they applied that same \u201cpeople and planet first\u201d business model to a second vertical: Food delivery\u2014the carbon-offset version.\u00a0 Facedrive\u2019s acquisition of Foodora from Deliver Hero positioned it near the top of Canada\u2019s food delivery hierarchy overnight. And Foodora\u2019s former owner Delivery Hero is the rare food delivery company not carrying around negative reputational baggage for bullying customers and restaurants at a time when they are struggling to make ends meet. They are international giants with services in 40 countries and a portfolio of over 500,000 restaurants. And Facedrive\u2019s new acquisition has hit the ground running \u2026 Next, comes international expansion \u2026. This Is Where Big Names Are Gathering Exelon\u2019s (NASDAQ:EXC)\u00a0market cap is ~$41 billion \u2026 and it\u2019s not the only huge market-cap company whose radar is pinging Facedrive: There\u2019s also a tie-in to eCommerce King Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) \u2026. Both global e-commerce giant Amazon and Canadian Tier-1 telecoms giant Telus jumped in on Facedrive\u2019s corporate partnership program. \u00a0And that news flew right under the radar because it wasn\u2019t officially announced and was revealed only when Facedrive released its Q1 earnings report. That means both giants will be Corporate partners of Facedrive meaning that their employees will receive preferred rates on Facedrive products and services. And they have \u2026 In October, Air Canada became the next big name to jump on the Facedrive bandwagon. So, watch the news flow on that one, too as talks progress with more big airlines \u2026 The name of this game is ultimate impact. Facedrive is chasing Big Money earmarked for ESG-focused plays \u2026 Big capital has tons of money to put into low-risk impact investing \u2026 But they can\u2019t find enough places to park it. That\u2019s where Facedrive ticks so many boxes. Whether it\u2019s pushing disruptors of the transportation industry from three different corners, with Facedrive ride-hailing, food delivery, and transformational Steer \u2026 Or whether it\u2019s helping giant airlines keep track of virus contacts. And with so many verticals, the news flow is hard to keep up with. The Electric Vehicle Revolution Is Kicking Into High Gear There\u2019s a reason Tesla has performed so well this year. Investors love Elon Musk\u2019s vision. As one of the world\u2019s most innovative car manufacturers, it has single-handedly made electric vehicles cool. Its slick design is beloved across the world. In fact, it\u2019s almost impossible to NOT see a Tesla in cities like Hong Kong or San Francisco. \u00a0 And Tesla isn\u2019t solely an electric vehicle company, either. It\u2019s also building its own energy business which includes revolutionary solar panels and top-tier battery technology. Clearly, its efforts are paying off, as it is without-a-doubt one of the most popular stocks on Wall Street Michael D. Farkas, Founder, CEO and Executive Chairman of Blink noted, \u201cThis is an exciting collaboration with EnerSys because it combines the industry-leading technologies of our two companies to provide user-friendly, high powered, next-generation charging alternatives. We are continuously innovating our product offerings to provide more efficient and convenient charging options to the growing community of EV drivers.\u201d In addition to the company\u2019s string of high-profile deals, Blink is also consistently posting promising revenues. In fact, earlier this month, the company noted that third-quarter revenue had increased by as much as 18% from the year before despite disruptions caused by the\u00a0 COVID-19 pandemic. Nio has made all the right moves over the past year to win over investors and turn heads on the streets and in the marketplace. On November 18th, NIO revealed a pair of sedans that even the biggest Tesla die-hard would struggle to pass up. The vehicles, meant to compete with Tesla\u2019s Model 3, could be just what the company needs to pull back control of its local market from Elon Musk\u2019s electric vehicle giant. Thanks to NIO\u2019s stellar performance this year, analysts have appeared to have changed their tune on the car-marker, upgrading its consensus price target by 34%, according to Simply Wall Street. In addition to raising its price target, the same analysts believe the company is on track to continue to outperform its peers in the short-term. Though Fisker has underperformed on the market compared to NIO, Tesla, Xpeng or Li, it\u2019s still trading on massive volume and in just one month, has already climbed by 50% since its IPO. Clearly, investors are still waiting to see how the company will hold up, especially following the Nikola disaster. But that doesn\u2019t mean the company isn\u2019t going places. The four-year-old California based EV provider is already turning heads thanks to its innovative battery tech, and it\u2019s already securing some major deals. In fact, just last month, Fisker signed a deal with Viggo, a European ride-hailing service to add hundreds of vehicles to its fleet. From nuclear to hydro and solar, Exelon Generation is at the cutting-edge of renewable energy. Thanks to its large footprint across the energy industry and forward-thinking attitude, it\u2019s performed consistently on the stock market, climbing by 49% over the past 5 years. And though that might not seem like a massive return for many growth investors, it\u2019s provided strong dividends every step of the way. In Exelon\u2019s most recent earnings report, the company posted total revenues of $8.853 billion, surpassing analyst expectations. Additionally, the company slashed its interest expenses and even raised its 2020 earnings guidance. Canadian Companies Are Fueling A Sustainability Boom  GreenPower Motor (TSX.V:GPV) is a thriving electric bus manufacturer based out of Vancouver. At the moment, its focus is primarily on the North American market, but its ambitions are much larger. Founded over 10 years ago, GreenPower has been on the frontlines of the electric transportation movement, with a focus on building affordable battery-electric busses and trucks. Year-to-date, GreenPower Motor has seen its share price soar from $2.03 to $36.88. That means investors have seen 1700% gains this year alone. And with this red-hot sector only going up, GreenPower will likely continue to impress.\u00a0\u00a0 NFI Group (TSX:NFI) is another one of Canada\u2019s home-grown electric vehicle pioneers producing transit busses and motorcycles. The company had a tough go at it towards the beginning of the year but has since cut its debt and begun to address its cash flow struggles in a meaningful way. Though it remains down from January highs, NFI still offers investors a promising opportunity to capitalize on the electric vehicle boom. In the previous months, NFI has seen an uptick in insider stock purchases which is often a sign that the board and management strongly believe in the future of the company. In addition to its increasingly positive financial reports, it is also one of the few in the business that actually pays dividends out to its investors.\u00a0 Canada\u2019s Silicon Valley is all in on the sustainability race, too. Shopify Inc (TSX:SH) Canada\u2019s own e-commerce giant helps users build their own online stores. It has huge clients \u2013 everyone from Tesla to Budweiser are on board. And the company is beloved by millennial investors. In addition to its revolutionary approach on e-commerce, Shopify is playing an increasingly active role in creating a greener tomorrow. It has committed to spending at least $5 million annually to help combat climate change. It\u2019s even making cuts throughout its own operations, decommissioning its data centers and sourcing renewable power for its buildings. Thanks to the these efforts, Shopify has posted a return of 137% this year alone, and is showing no signs of slowing. By. Terry Goddard **IMPORTANT!

    "article_text":"\n GM stock, after stalling for close to a decade, is driving in the fast lane. On Tuesday, GM stock dashed to the cusp of an all-time high. Though it's still unclear how far GM stock can go on this charge, General Motors continues to demonstrate that Wall Street has been underestimating its EV potential. All three of GM's big future bets are showing promise. GM's new Ultium battery-powered 2022 Hummer EV sold out minutes after its unveiling last month. A deal to supply fuel cells for Nikola heavy-duty trucks, after a disastrous launch, may still go forward. And its Cruise self-driving vehicle unit recently passed a big milestone. After the third-quarter GM earnings report turned heads, General Motors last week mapped out its road to beating its prior goal of one million EV sales by 2025 and achieving EV battery cost-reductions and efficiency gains. So is now a good time to buy GM stock? While GM earnings shifted into overdrive in Q3, those earnings come from sales of vehicles with internal combustion engines. That's a business which Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas describes as a \"melting ice cube,\" destined for a long-term decline. Wall Street analysts have argued in recent months that GM should spin off its Ultium electric vehicle operations to get a more proper valuation. Deutsche Bank analyst Emmanuel Rosner had said that a spinoff of EV operations could fetch a value of $20 billion to $100 billion, while easing access to capital and top talent. Yet GM CEO Mary Barra killed that idea at the Nov. 19 Barclays Global Automotive Conference. \"Our integrated strategy is a competitive advantage for GM.\" Barra said GM will realize $2 billion in cost efficiencies from shared engineering, manufacturing, marketing and corporate cost. Cash flow from GM operations will fund an accelerated $7 billion in EV investment through 2025, while still allowing General Motors to reinstate its dividend in 2021. \"We're committed to fighting for EV market share until we are number one in North America, achieving margins similar to or higher than our ICE business and exceeding our previous target of selling one million vehicles globally by mid-decade.\" On Oct. 16, GM stock first nosed its grille into buy range, clearing a buy point at 33.43, 10 cents above its Sept. 8 high. Then, on Oct. 20, ahead of that night's highly anticipated Hummer EV launch, General Motors announced that a third U.S. factory would be switched to making electric vehicles. GM stock shifted into high gear. The stock advanced 6.75% to 35.60, clearing the 5% chase zone beyond which stock purchases carry higher risk. The momentum has continued. GM stock rose as high as 46.71 on Tuesday, Nov. 24, just below its October 2017 all-time high of 46.76. General Motors earnings haven't seen steady growth in the past couple of years, as auto sales peaked in the U.S. and hit a pothole in China. A UAW strike hurt results in the second half 2019. Then Covid-19 marred the first half of 2020. But in Q3, everything seemed to fall into place. General Motors earnings per share surged 65% to $2.83, as GM \"showcased the benefit from its deep structural cost reductions,\" Rosner said. Revenue of $35.5 billion was flat from a year ago and in line with estimates. In the third quarter, GM deliveries in the U.S. recovered to 665,192 vs. 492,489 amid the coronavirus lockdown in Q2. Deliveries still fell 10% from a year ago, but GM said each month saw improvement, and September sales exceeded the year-ago total. GM restarted factories on May 18 after a two-month coronavirus suspension. Lean inventories have held back sales, but GM has said that large pickup and full-size SUV plants are now all operating on three shifts and at maximum overtime. With cheap oil prices, General Motors appears well-positioned in the U.S. market, seeing demand for pickup trucks and crossover SUVs. Now sales in China also are on the upswing. General Motors and its Chinese joint-venture partners saw deliveries rise 12% to 771,400. GM sales outpaced the Chinese market as a whole, a nice turnaround from Q2, when deliveries fell 5% as China's market grew 10%. GM unveiled the Hummer EV truck during the World Series, touting \"maneuverability and traction unlike anything GM has ever offered.\" The Hummer's CrabWalk mode, allowing it to move diagonally to get through tight off-road spots, quickly went viral. \"I think investors are crab-walking back to the stock,\" Morgan Stanley's Adam Jonas said on an Oct. 21 analyst call with management. The Rivian RT1 will likely be released before the GM Hummer, but the Tesla Cybertruck may not be out until 2022. Prices for the initial Hummer EV version start at $112,595. General Motors said all available reservations for the Hummer EV sold out within 10 minutes, but didn't detail how many refundable $100 deposits it accepted. GM plans cheaper Hummer EV versions in future years. On Sept. 8, General Motors and Nikola announced a partnership that would see the top U.S. automaker build several versions of Nikola's Badger truck using GM's own fuel cell technology and Ultium EV battery. GM also agreed to supply fuel cells to Nikola's heavy-duty trucks, expanding GM's market opportunity. In exchange for the services it provides, GM was supposed to receive $2 billion worth of Nikola stock. The news, which appeared to further validate GM's technological relevance, sent GM stock surging. However, the deal came into question as Nikola's stock dived as its founder left the company amid allegations of being a huckster and personal misconduct. GM President Mark Reuss recently sounded upbeat about being able to finalize terms with Nikola. \"The opportunity to put our fuel cells into a class 7 and 8 vehicle is spectacular,\" he told CNBC on Oct. 21. However, GM may be reluctant to finalize a deal while Nikola is under investigation. Nikola said last week that GM talks continue. GM had a puzzle to solve: How could it compete broadly in the still relatively small EV market, en route to an all-electric future, without frittering away its financial strength? The answer came with the March 4 unveiling of its Ultium battery and flexible platform. The Ultium stands apart for its ability to be stacked either vertically or horizontally in the battery pack, to optimize the layout of each vehicle. The biggest stack is said to have the power to reach 400 miles on a full charge. The platform can accommodate a wide range of trucks, SUVs and cars. CEO Mary Barra has said that GM's multisegment EV strategy has \"economies of scale that rival our full-size truck business with much less complexity and even more flexibility.\" The first generation of GM's coming EV lineup \"will be profitable,\" the company said.\u00a0Since then, GM has detailed a much more complete vision of its EV future. In September,\u00a0GM unveiled its strategy to produce electric drive systems that are designed in-house to deliver cost and performance benefits. GM says the five drive units and three motors will offer the power and versatility to work with the full range of some 20 different EVs it plans to produce by 2023. GM said these Ultium Drive systems \"will be more responsive than its internal combustion equivalents with precision torque control of its motors for smooth performance.\" The Honda deal created a partnership model that the Nikola deal could follow. Barra said that supplying GM technology to rival automakers would build \"scale to lower battery and fuel cell costs and increase profitability.\" Now GM is highlighting progress in testing its next-generation Ultium battery chemistry. \"We believe we are on the battery-cost frontier today and we intend to set the pace for the future,\" said GM product development chief Doug Parks. In January, General Motors unveiled its six-passenger Cruise Origin, which has no steering wheel. But the company laid off 8% of its workforce in May as it paced itself for a future that is still just over the horizon. Cruise had hoped to launch a robotaxi service in San Francisco late in 2019. GM and others were too optimistic about how fast they could solve what Barra has called \"the greatest engineering challenge of our lifetime.\" She's remains optimistic about unlocking \"the multitrillion-dollar market potential\" of self-driving cars, though some experts now think that market might not develop until late this decade. Yet even GM's Cruise venture has started generating some excitement. In October, the company received the first permit to test its driverless cars without a backup driver on the streets of San Francisco. \"We'll be the first doing it in a complex urban environment,\" Barra said on the Q3 call. \"And why that's so important is, if you think about even today's ride sharing, the opportunity for profitability is in dense urban environments.\" GM bought Cruise Automation for $1.1 billion in 2016. Key investors include Honda, which in 2018 put $750 million into the venture and agreed to put up $2 billion more over 12 years. Tesla, meanwhile, has released a new Full Self Driving beta version to select drivers. But despite the name, Tesla FSD is still a Level 2, hands-on system, while Cruise and Waymo are Level 4. Because GM's traditional business faces a long-term decline, and it's been through a restructuring, fundamental metrics don't tell the full story. Undoubtedly, there is lots of execution risk and uncertainty, but Wall Street sees plenty of promise developing. If analysts see GM as a \"stable of unicorns\" with high-growth potential, as Morgan Stanley's Jonas has said, they could begin to use a more flattering lens for valuing future earnings. However, there's no indication that GM will spin off its EV operations. GM joint ventures in China could be hurt if U.S.-China tensions grow. GM Cruise could turn out to be a robotaxi leader, but don't hold your breath. The biggest uncertainty may be GM's ability to compete with Tesla, which aims to drive down the price of its EVs to $25,000 in three years. The clearest immediate reason to steer clear of GM stock is that it has advanced well beyond the chase zone since its Oct. 16 breakout. Bottom line: Investors intrigued by GM's EV future should be patient. GM is not in a proper buy zone.

    "article_text":"Tech entrepreneur Elon Musk has topped Microsoft founder Bill Gates to become the world's second richest man after a meteoric rise in his personal fortune. Mr Musk's net worth jumped by $7.2bn (\u00a35.4bn) to $128bn after shares in his car firm Tesla surged. It comes after news Tesla shares will be added to the S&P 500, one of the main share indexes in the US. That triggered a fresh wave of buying of the electric carmaker's shares, sending the company's market value above $500bn and boosting the value of Mr Musk's holding in the business. Tesla is already the most valuable car firm in the world, despite producing a fraction of the vehicles of rivals such as Toyota, VW and General Motors. On Tuesday, in a speech in Germany, Mr Musk said it could \"make sense\" for Tesla to expand in Europe by entering the mass-market segment with a small car. \"In the US, the cars tend to be bigger for personal taste reasons,\" he said. \"In Europe, (they) tend to be smaller.\" And after years of losses, Tesla has seen five consecutive quarters of profit as sales of its cars perform well despite the pandemic. The California-based firm will be the biggest new entrant on the S&P 500, with a market value of more than $500bn. It means investment funds tracking the index will automatically hold its stock and benefit from gains in its share price - news that has excited investors. Bill Gates, who co-founded Microsoft, was the world's richest person for years before Mr Bezos knocked him off the top spot in 2017. Mr Gates's fortune is worth $127.7bn but would be higher had he not donated large sums to charity over the decades. Jeff Bezos's net worth is estimated at \u00a3182bn by Bloomberg. He too has seen his personal fortune rise this year as demand for Amazon's services climbed in the pandemic. Mr Musk, who regularly courts controversy, has had an eventful past few weeks. Last weekend he tweeted that he \"most likely\" had a moderate case of Covid-19 and has had symptoms of \"a minor cold.\" It came the day before four astronauts were launched to the International Space Station in a rocket built by Mr Musk's SpaceX."

    "article_text":"As the EV pioneer delivered a series of earnings beats and record deliveries, the market has reacted in kind. Heading into the final stretch of 2020, the stock is up by a massive 563%. Last week, GM's CEO Mary Barra said the company is \u201cgoing all out with EVs.\u201d GM expects to boast 30 EV models by 2025 (compared to 20 by 2023), and is building new production facilities to accomplish its goals. Furthermore, the company will form a whole new marketing unit focused solely on the EV opportunity. \u201cThis additional competition\u201d said Gill, \u201cCould hurt the steep sales ramp that Tesla needs to achieve in order to justify its valuation.\u201d GM\u2019s expected price range for its assault on the EV sector will range between $30,000 (targeting Tesla\u2019s Model 3) all the way up to \u201cmore exotic $100K+ options.\u201d Gill argues it looks like a \u201cdirect move against all of Tesla's key product lines, from the more-affordable Model 3 to the \u2018ludicrous-moded\u2019 Model S.\u201d For Gill, it all points to an uphill struggle for Musk and Co. The 5-star analyst wrote, \"Despite Tesla's recent accomplishments, such as its quarterly profits in the past 4 quarters and record deliveries, we are bearish on the stock due to increasing competitive pricing pressure, increasing OpEx to support Gigafactory Shanghai (and later Europe) and Model Y ramps, and the automaker\u2019s history of profitability issues.\u201d Moreover, \"we expect the company to experience obstacles and setbacks as it scales manufacturing of the Model Y and Cybertruck.

Of the 11 major S&P sectors, 10 gained ground, led by economically sensitive stocks such as financials, materials and energy, while industrials hit a record. President Donald Trump finally gave the green light for the formal transfer of power to begin on Monday, a process that was delayed for weeks despite Democrat Joe Biden emerging as the clear winner in the U.S. elections. The General Services Administration told Biden he could formally begin the handover process. Sentiment this week was also boosted by reports that Biden planned to nominate former Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen as Treasury Secretary, which could shift the focus heavily toward efforts to tackle growing economic inequality. Recent data suggesting a COVID-19 vaccine could be available before the end of the year has put the S&P 500 on course for its best monthly performance since April and sparked demand for value-linked stocks that were hammered following the coronavirus-driven crash earlier this year. \"A little bit of decreasing uncertainty on the election front, the market seems pretty favorable on the Yellen announcement, it just seems like one of those good days where all things are moving a little higher,\" said Ross Mayfield, investment strategy analyst at Baird. \"If 2020 has shown us anything it is that stock markets have a tremendous ability to look past bad news if there is sun on the horizon.\" The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 454.97 points, or 1.54%, to 30,046.24, the S&P 500 gained 57.82 points, or 1.62%, to 3,635.41 and the Nasdaq Composite added 156.15 points, or 1.31%, to 12,036.79. The Dow rose as high as 30,116.51 during the session and the S&P 500 also closed at a record high. While the 30,000 mark represents a psychological milestone, it means little to professional investors. U.S. officials said on Tuesday they plan to release 6.4 million COVID-19 vaccine doses nationwide in an initial distribution after the first one is cleared by regulators for emergency use. Electric-car maker Tesla Inc jumped 6.43% to boost its market value to over $500 billion, as investors lapped up its shares in the run-up to its addition to the S&P 500 index. Boeing Co gained 3.29% after European regulators gave draft approval to its 737 MAX jets, paving the way for a formal flight clearance in January. BlackRock Inc, the world's largest asset manager, on Monday upgraded U.S. equities to \"overweight,\" turning bullish on quality large-cap technology companies and small cap firms that tend to perform well during a cyclical upswing. Still, with coronavirus cases surging by the day and millions of Americans still unemployed, some analysts suggested the U.S. stock market could be prone to a pullback and volatility from record levels in the next few months. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 3.16-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.09-to-1 ratio favored advancers. The S&P 500 posted 56 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 197 new highs and 12 new lows. Volume on U.S. exchanges was 14.18 billion shares, compared with the 11.18 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

    "article_text":"(For a Reuters live blog on U.S., UK and European stock markets, click LIVE\/ or type LIVE\/ in a news window.) * S&P 500 on track for biggest monthly percentage gain since April * Tesla market value crosses $500 billion * Economically-sensitive industrials, banks, energy stocks jump * Dow up 1.34%, S&P 500 up 1.44%, Nasdaq up 1.18% (Updates to mid-afternoon, changes byline) By Chuck Mikolajczak NEW YORK, Nov 24 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rallied on Tuesday, with the Dow piercing the 30,000 level for the first time, as investors anticipated a 2021 economic recovery on progress on coronavirus vaccines and the formal clearance for President-elect Joe Biden's transition to the White House. Each of the 11 major S&P sectors was higher, led by economically sensitive stocks such as industrials, which climbed to a record, along with the financials, up 2.8% and energy, up 4.2%. President Donald Trump finally gave the green light for the formal transfer of power to begin on Monday, a process that was delayed for weeks despite Democrat Joe Biden emerging as the clear winner in the elections. The General Services Administration told Biden he could formally begin the hand-over process. \"You had the GSA transitioning and Trump saying he is going to cooperate. That is a positive,\" said Thomas Martin, senior portfolio manager at Globalt Investments in Atlanta. \"Nobody was worried about it, but just the fact you're greasing the wheels for the transition instead of trying to throw a monkey wrench in them is decent news.\" The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 395.22 points, or 1.34%, to 29,986.49; the S&P 500 gained 51.48 points, or 1.44%, at 3,629.07 and the Nasdaq Composite added 140.41 points, or 1.18%, at 12,021.05. Recent data suggesting a COVID-19 vaccine could be available before the end of the year has put the S&P 500 on course for its best November ever and sparked demand for value-linked stocks that were hammered following the coronavirus-driven crash earlier this year. U.S. officials said on Tuesday they plan to release 6.4 million COVID-19 vaccine doses nationwide in an initial distribution after the first one is cleared by regulators for emergency use. Sentiment this week was also boosted by reports that Biden planned to nominate former Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen as Treasury Secretary, which could shift the focus heavily toward efforts to tackle growing economic inequality. Electric-car maker Tesla Inc jumped 6.7%, boosting its market value to over $500 billion, as investors lapped up its shares in the run-up to its addition to the S&P 500 index. Boeing Co gained 2.8% after European regulators gave draft approval to its 737 MAX jets, paving the way for a formal flight clearance in January. BlackRock Inc, the world's largest asset manager, on Monday upgraded U.S. equities to \"overweight,\" turning bullish on quality large-cap technology companies and small cap firms that tend to perform well during a cyclical upswing. Still, with coronavirus cases surging by the day and millions of Americans still unemployed, some analysts suggested the U.S. stock market could be prone to a pullback from record levels in the next few weeks. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by a 3.29-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.95-to-1 ratio favored advancers. The S&P 500 posted 54 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 192 new highs and nine new lows. (Reporting by Chuck Mikolajczak; Editing by Richard Chang)"

    "article_text":"\n The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped more than 500 points, as President Trump agreed to cooperate with the federal transition to a Joe Biden administration. Nio and Tesla stock again raced to record highs, but Nio reversed sharply lower in morning trade. Best Buy tumbled after reporting earnings ahead of the stock market open. On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 1.6%, while the S&P 500 gained 1.5%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite followed up with a 0.9% rise in midday trade. Late Monday, General Services Administration chief Emily Murphy told President-elect Joe Biden that the Trump administration is cooperating with his transition into office.\u00a0Biden and his aides will have access to agency officials, briefings and more, a well as some $6 million in funds.

The cumulative total of worldwide Covid-19 cases confirmed since the start of the outbreak topped 59.6 million Tuesday, with more than 1.4 million virus-related deaths. Investors should use the stock market strength as a go-ahead to buy new breakouts. Start slowly with new purchases and see how they perform. After raising cash during the recent correction, don't rush to be fully invested all at once. Try some new buys. If they work, you can add to them; if not, you can back away. The cloud software company is the No. 1-performing stock on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, advancing 58.4% year to date. Shares tumbled over 5% in morning trade, and are testing their key 50-day support level. Keep a close eye on the stock's RS line. It hasn't hit a new high, as the stock moves above the buy point. Ideally, the RS line should hit a new high on the breakout day to confirm the stock as a market leader. Chinese rival Nio briefly advanced 3% Tuesday, attempting to extend a win streak to four sessions. Shares reversed lower in morning trade, dropping more than 3%. The stock set a record high early Tuesday, reaching an all-time high at 57.20. On Nov. 18, shares broke out above a 466 buy point in an awkward cup with handle. The 5% buy zone tops out at 489.30, so the stock is extended. Apple stock continues to trace a new base with a 138.08 buy point. An early entry exists at 125.49. But the top Dow Jones stock is starting to show signs of significant weakness. The blue-chip giant is the No. 2-performing Dow Jones stock for 2020, with a 55.1% advance through Monday. Software giant Microsoft moved up 1% Tuesday, as the stock looks to regain its 50-day moving average line. Shares fell below that critical support level last week. Year to date, Microsoft is one of the top Dow Jones stocks, advancing 33.2% through the Nov. 23 close.

Image source: Getty Images. Under the Obama administration, qualifying buyers of Tesla vehicles received significant tax credits. These tax credits represented an effort from the administration to help transition the U.S. more rapidly toward green energy. But the Trump administration was largely against these credits, and they were phased out for Tesla under Trump's leadership. Some Tesla investors may be hoping that a Biden administration reenergizes green energy incentives, helping accelerate demand for Tesla's electric cars, solar panels, and energy storage products. Investors shouldn't count on an incentive to bolster demand for Tesla's products, as there are no guarantees Tesla customers will receive any new incentives. Moreover, to justify the company's $500 billion market capitalization, the electric-car maker will need more than a near-term boost from tax credits -- the company needs to demonstrate strong organic growth in demand. Fortunately, demand for Tesla vehicles has fared just fine ever since the federal tax credits were phased out.

After weeks of legal challenges by the Trump campaign to overturn the election result, the U.S. federal agency that must sign off on the presidential transition told Biden on Monday that he can formally begin the hand-over process. Sentiment was also boosted on reports that Biden planned to nominate former Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen as Treasury Secretary, which could shift the focus heavily toward efforts to tackle growing economic inequality. Tesla Inc jumped 3.3%, with the electric-car maker crossing $500 billion in market capitalization as investors lapped up its shares in the run-up to its addition to the S&P 500 index. At 10:28 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 381.55 points, or 1.29%, at 29,972.82, the S&P 500 was up 34.06 points, or 0.95%, at 3,611.65, and the Nasdaq Composite was up 37.95 points, or 0.32%, at 11,918.58. Recent data suggesting a COVID-19 vaccine could be available before the end of the year has put the benchmark S&P 500 on course for its best November since 1980 and brought the Dow close to breaching 30,000 points for the first time. BlackRock Inc, the world's largest asset manager, on Monday upgraded U.S. equities to \"overweight\", turning bullish on quality large-cap technology companies and small cap firms that tend to perform well during a cyclical upswing. \"There is a lot of interest in industrials, basic materials, financials - that's what you are supposed to buy for the text books when the economy is indicating that it's going to enter into a rebound or an expansion cycle,\" Pavlik said. The S&P value index, which includes economically-sensitive sectors such as financials and industrials, has gained about 12% so far in November compared with a 9% rise in the S&P 500. By contrast, the growth index , comprising the technology mega-caps, is up less than 8%. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners 3.94-to-1 on the NYSE and 2.01-to-1 on the Nasdaq. The S&P index recorded 43 new 52-week highs and no new low, while the Nasdaq recorded 146 new highs and four new lows.

    "article_text":"PARIS (Reuters) - U.S. electric vehicle maker Tesla is looking at expanding in Europe by entering the mass-market segment with a compact car, Chief Executive Elon Musk said on Tuesday. \"Possibly in Europe it would make sense to do, I guess, a compact car, perhaps a hatchback or something like that,\" Musk told an European online conference on batteries hosted by the German government. \"In the U.S., the cars tend to be bigger for personal taste reasons,\" he said. \"In Europe, (they) tend to be smaller.\" Musk said he had had some problems parking his five-metre long Tesla Model X car in German capital Berlin. \"I was driving a Model X around Berlin and we had quite a bit of trouble finding a parking space where we could fit,\" he said. The California-based automaker currently sells 4 car models including its mid-sized Model 3 sedan and medium-sized Model Y sport-utility vehicle. All its vehicles are several tens of centimetres longer than Volkswagen's Golf car, the European reference in compact sedans. On a global level, Tesla is also due to market its new \"Cybertruck\" pickup within two years. (Reporting by Leigh Thomas and Gilles Guillaume; Writing by Matthieu Protard; Editing by Jan Harvey)"

Registration of new cars in the European Union (EU) totaled 953,615 units for October, down 7.8% year over year. Passenger car registrations in EU during the 10 months ended October 2020 declined around 27% year over year to 8 million units. This marked the worst decline, outpacing the slump during the 2009 financial crisis. (European Car Sales Rebound Falters, Outlook Remains Muted)  On the news front, Tesla TSLA grabbed headlines and its shares rallied around 20% for the week ended Nov 20 on the news that the electric carmaker is set to enter the S&P 500. The\u00a0S&P Dow Jones Indices announced\u00a0that Tesla will be added to the closely-followed stock index on Dec 21, before the market opens. It will be one of the largest companies to be added to the S&P 500 in the past decade. Tesla will be among the most valuable companies ever added to the S&P 500 and make up about 1% of the index.

Management will increase investment in EVs to $27 billion by 2025 from the budget of $20 billion laid out before the COVID-19 outbreak. Further, by 2025, General Motors plans to roll out 30 electric vehicles globally, more than two-thirds of which will be available in North America. The vehicles will encompass the company\u2019s entire brand portfolio \u2014 including Cadillac, Buick, GMC, and Chevrolet \u2014 in a range of prices.

Robust deliveries in third-quarter 2020 led to the outperformance.NIO expects fourth-quarter deliveries in the band of 16,500-17,000 vehicles, signaling an uptick of 103% at the mid-point of the range. Fourth-quarter revenues are forecast between $921.8 million and $947.9 million, indicating a year-over-year rise of 123% the midpoint of the guided range.

    "article_text":"\n Stocks plowed into early gains Tuesday after a key federal agency in Washington moved to support a smooth transition of federal power, while coronavirus vaccine optimism continued to lift global markets. Tesla led an early rally among electric car makers. Earnings news pointed Dollar Tree and Anaplan toward early breakouts. And on the Dow Jones today, Goldman Sachs was rising in a buy range. President Donald Trump tweeted an acknowledgement that the General Services Administration Administrator Emily Murphy had begun the process of providing President-elect Joe Biden and his incoming administration with funding, offices and access to information necessary to the transition of White House administrations due to take place in January. Murphy's move followed a key court decision against the Trump legal team in Pennsylvania, and the certification of Biden's win by the Michigan State Board of Canvassers, both on Monday. Stock markets read the GSA move, and Trump's acknowledgement, as an increase in certainty that an orderly transfer of power will take place. Boeing shares are in a five-month base pattern with a 234.30 buy point. The pattern could be shaping a handle. Dollar Tree\u00a0rallied more than 8%, after its third-quarter results blew past analyst expectations. The stock ended Monday less than 4% below a 101.35 buy point in a three-month cup-with-handle base. The number of new coronavirus cases and deaths reported daily continued to climb through Monday. Worldwide, daily cases, tracked on a seven-day average, rose to 588,269 \u2014 up 20% in November and 121% higher than Sept. 1, according to data from Worldometer. The seven-day average for deaths hit 9,809. That is more than 54% higher than the start of November and 40% above the prior peak in deaths, registered in April. In the U.S., the seven-day average for daily new cases rose to 176,434 on Monday. That's a 115% jump since Oct. 31, and more than 390% above a mid-September low. The seven-day average for deaths reached 1,577, its highest level since May, and up 84% since the start of November. China's markets finished mixed, but Tokyo's Nikkei 225 reopened after a three-day weekend and soared 2.5%. Markets in Europe traded squarely higher, with London's FTSE 100, Frankfurt's DAX and the CAC-40 in Paris all up more than 1% in afternoon trade. Energy names drove a large share of gains in Europe, as oil prices have jumped into a fourth weekly advance, with West Texas Intermediate ending Monday up more than 20% so far in November, and settling above $43 a barrel for the first time since September. Prices have gained on prospects of a vaccine-bolstered coronavirus economy, and of less volatile policy in Washington, combined with production discipline from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. Energy stocks led Europe's Stoxx 600 index higher, according to Bloomberg, with travel companies and banks also figuring high in the mix.

    "article_text":"(Bloomberg) -- Tesla Inc. is smashing through records as its impending addition to the S&P 500 Index has sparked a buying frenzy among investors, pushing the company\u2019s market valuation over the $500 billion mark for the first time on Tuesday. Shares of the electric vehicle company have soared this year, rising nearly 550%, with gains accelerating over the past week after S&P Dow Jones Indices last Monday said Tesla will be added to the benchmark. The stock surge helped co-founder Elon Musk add $100.3 billion to his net worth this year and overtake Bill Gates to become the world\u2019s second-richest person. Read more: Musk Overtakes Gates to Grab World\u2019s Second-Richest Ranking Tesla shares rose as much as 4.1% in New York in early trading, touching an all-time high of $543.17, and pushing its market capitalization to over $506 billion. Crossing the treshold valuation brings true a prediction from Musk, who is said to have made it 18 months ago in a call with investors. With Tesla set to join the index on Dec. 21, money managers and investors who closely track the S&P 500 will now have to buy the stock in order to accurately mirror the gauge. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. has said Tesla\u2019s inclusion could result in $8 billion of demand from active U.S. large-cap mutual funds. Tesla\u2019s ascension and entrance into the group of blue-chip investments is also good news for the broader sector. Nio Inc., Workhorse Group Inc., Nikola Corp., Lordstown Motors Corp., XPeng Inc., Li Auto Inc. and Ayro Inc. have also rallied and some are now trading at new record highs. Electric-vehicle makers and other related companies across the world have also enjoyed frenzied buying on optimism the auto sector will be dominated by electric-powered cars in the decades ahead. That combined with high valuations for Tesla is pushing investors to lesser known names that can benefit from the sector\u2019s growth opportunities, but with a smaller share price.

Image source: Getty Images. NIO went public in late 2018, well before the current wave of electric car IPOs. Unlike Nikola and Lordstown, NIO is already producing electric vehicles. Taking a page from Tesla's playbook, NIO started with a sports car in 2016 and then quickly transitioned into specializing in electric SUVs, including 2017's full-size ES8, 2019's midsize ES6, and 2020's EC6 \"coupe SUV,\" essentially a crossover SUV. So, although NIO is currently growing by leaps and bounds, it has a long way to go to justify its current valuation. Analysts have been questioning the lofty valuation of Tesla -- currently the world's largest automaker by market cap -- for years. While I'm wary of calling NIO \"the next Tesla,\" the company certainly has some similarities with its larger U.S. rival that could bode well for its future. Much like Tesla, NIO has chosen to focus on a handful of models. Tesla got its Model S sports coupe production up and running before it moved on to the Model X and eventually the Model 3.  NIO's financials also look similar to early stage Tesla's: Revenue is increasing at a rapid clip, and while the company's net income is still negative, it's showing gradual improvement. However, the company's debt load is also increasing quickly. It's worth remembering that Tesla didn't post consecutive quarterly profits until 2018, and its debt load finally peaked (at least for now) at about $13.4 billion at the beginning of this year. NIO investors should expect a long wait before the company achieves profitability. Thus far, Tesla -- via its Shanghai Gigafactory -- has dominated the Chinese electric vehicle market. However, it's reasonable to expect that the Chinese government will favor domestic EV manufacturers like NIO over foreign companies like Tesla. That could be NIO's secret ace in the hole. General Motors' sales, though, currently dwarf both Tesla's and NIO's. GM sold more than 3 million vehicles in China in 2019. By contrast, Tesla is on track to sell about 150,000 Model 3s in China in 2020. Even with potential favorable treatment from the Chinese government, NIO has a lot of ground to make up here.  NIO certainly has the potential to live up to its lofty valuation. It operates in an underserved niche in a rapidly expanding market where it has a home-court advantage. However, it's starting from scratch while its bigger and wealthier rivals are building on existing brand recognition and manufacturing expertise. Ultimately, NIO is a promising but speculative player in the emerging electric vehicle market. Investors who can stomach the risk may want to take a chance on the company, but they should be aware that it will take time before the company can prove itself successful... if ever.\u00a0 Editor's note: This article has been corrected. NIO has four cars currently in-market: the ES8, the All-New ES8, the ES6, and the EC6. NIO has not disclosed its upcoming models of cars. Stock Advisor launched in February of 2002.

Boeing climbed 3.2% in premarket trade after European regulators gave draft approval to the planemaker's 737 MAX jets, paving the way for a formal flight clearance in January. Futures linked to the blue-chip Dow jumped 1% in early trading, outperforming Nasdaq 100 futures as investors set up to again rotate out of the technology heavyweights that were seen as safe bets during the recession. \"Today, the market is going to largely focus on the new administration's steps going forward,\" said Robert Pavlik, senior portfolio manager at Dakota Wealth in New York.

Shares of Tesla Inc, the world's most valuable automaker, rose 4.6% premarket, putting the company on track to hit $500 billion in market value at the opening bell.

Signs that a working COVID-19 vaccine could be available before the end of the year have put the benchmark S&P 500 on course for its best November since 1980 and rekindled demand for cyclical sectors such as industrials and financials after a virus-led crash earlier this year. BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, on Monday upgraded U.S. equities to \"overweight\", turning bullish on quality large-cap technology companies and small cap firms that tend to perform well during a cyclical upswing. \"There are still a lot (of) questions about how the coronavirus is going to affect the economy between now and the time that we get the vaccine distributed to people,\" Pavlik said. \"(But) there is a lot of interest in industrials, basic materials, financials - that's what you are supposed to buy for the text books when the economy is indicating that it's going to enter into a rebound or an expansion cycle.\" Apparel retailer Abercrombie & Fitch Co's shares surged 9.1% after the company beat expectations for quarterly sales as more consumers working from home shopped online. Investor attention will be on consumer confidence data for November due later in the day, although trading volumes are expected to be light in a week shortened by the Thanksgiving holiday on Thursday.

CEO Michael Saylor flipped the narrative when it started purchasing Bitcoin in August. With its enormous bitcoin purchase and a sales outlook that is looking a whole lot brighter as its licensing and subscription-based sales soars, analysts are increasingly optimistic about the future of this business, pushing MSTR into a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). MicroStrategy became the largest American corporation to invest in bitcoin as a 'store of value' when it purchased 38,250 coins between August and September for an average price of $11,111 per coin ($425 million in value), giving it the institutional seal of approval. Now fintech giants like Square and PayPal are buying up large sums of the pioneering blockchain currency. This big institutional bid has Bitcoin soaring in the past few months. BTC was trading below $10,000 as recently as September, a price it has struggled to stay above since the end of the Crypto-Craze in the first months of 2018. Bitcoin hit resistance at its 2017 high this week and pulled back to below $17, but I don't believe this rally is over.\u00a0 MicroStrategy has already netted a $286 million (68%) gain on its Bitcoin purchase in just three months, and it looks like the cryptocurrency is headed beyond $20k. I expect that more and more institutions will follow suit, adding to Bitcoins already red-hot momentum. Saylor made a seemingly savvy business decision when he decided to store his enterprise's liquid capital in Bitcoin. He made this judgment call in the face of ultra-low interest rates that were poised to eat away at MicroStrategy's cash reserve value. Jerome Powell and the Federal Reserve are printing money like there's no tomorrow and vowing to let inflation run past its 2% target to make up for the past two decades of below-target inflation. MicroStrategy's management team felt that gold is an antiquated store of value and that Bitcoin's blockchain-driven cryptocurrency is the future of inflation-protected assets. The world of finance is shifting rapidly, and MicroStrategy is leading the shift towards blockchain-powered balance sheet management. Today roughly 1\/3rd of MSTR's market value is derived from Bitcoin, and its share price changes have been highly correlated with BTC's price action. I see MSTR as a hedged way to invest in the resurgence of the Crypto-Craze that I expect to continue into next year. MicroStrategy was an unfortunate product of the late '90's tech bubble. MSTR surged over 3300% from May of 1999 to its high in early March of 2000, topping out at $3330. A year and a half later, MSTR was trading in the single digits, having lost over 99% of its peak value. The company has been chugging along with little growth, but it appears that MicroStrategy is finally turning the heaters back on, resurging this digitally incepted enterprise back into growth. The shrewd Bitcoin purchase was just one lever exemplifying MSTR's growth potential. The business's newly released HyperIntellegence platform has been met with strong demand, and its other segments are all enjoying 2020's digital tailwind with the rapid adaptation of MicroStrategy's cloud technology. I expect that the business's resurgence into growth will continue throughout the digitally-driven Roaring 20s. If you want to invest in the second wave of Bitcoin mania, MSTR is an excellent (hedged) way to do so. Keep in mind that these shares will still be quite correlated with BTC's highly volatile price. I would not recommend a large position in this enterprise, but it is one that is worth looking into. The retail apocalypse hit the fan in 2020 as foot-traffic halted and click-traffic surged. The retail sector has seen a massive divergence this year. Digital-inclined omnichannel retailers and e-commerce shopping platforms far outperformed the plummeting shares of legacy retailers. Simon Property Group is starting to feel the adverse implications of the declining retail sector. A sizable portion of its traditional brick-and-mortar clients are reaching a breaking point. Many have been forced into bankruptcy, closing their storefronts and defaulting on their lease obligations with Simon Property. SPG is the best-in-class real estate investment trust (REIT) for shopping, dining, and entertainment, but unfortunately, its clientele are operating in a declining industry. The post-pandemic\u00a0New Normal\u00a0is going to be one that is driven by click-traffic while foot-traffic falls. Analysts have been increasingly pessimistic about this business's future, dropping EPS estimates for years to come and pushing SPG into a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). With 2 high potential vaccines on the horizon, investors & traders are beginning to price foot-traffic back into the markets with a light at the end of the COVID tunnel. The beat-up traditional retailer space has been catching a bid in the past couple of weeks as the equity markets move up the timeline to full economic recovery. Since Pfizer's first vaccine announcement earlier this month, SPG has jumped 41%, but is this move justified? Despite the revived optimism about 2021, COVID cases have been surging, and we may be in for a cold economic winter, with states already beginning to lockdown again. Brick-and-mortar retailers are in for more pain before the end of the pandemic. The night is always darkest before the dawn, and this statement has never been truer than it is for traditional storefronts today. The retail apocalypse has been occurring for the past 5 years as the ease of shopping right from your couch has reduced foot-traffic levels in malls and shopping centers. This has been devastating for mall operators like Simon Property Group, as well as department stores, many of which have filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy. I believe that the pandemic is cleaning house. Getting rid of antiquated business models that were already on their way out and allowing well-adopted retail businesses that provide what consumers want\/need to thrive. SPG is the best-in-class REIT of a dying sector, but it will need to make some structural changes in order to adapt to the shifting consumer. Some value investors may argue that there is still opportunity in the 'heavily discounted' department stores. Still, I'm not chasing these antiquated names unless they can flip the obsolescence narrative and adapt to the rapidly changing consumer. Snaprecently introduced an entertainment-based feature on the Snapchat app called Spotlight, where it will highlight creative short videos from users, in an effort to compete with China-based ByteDance\u2019s TikTok app. Spotlight features auto-playing vertical videos, which can be swiped up or down to quickly move between clips.\u00a0 It is designed to highlight entertaining videos from all users, regardless of the number of followers or influence they have. The new feature is available in the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, UK, Ireland, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Germany, and France. Markedly, Snap shares declined 2.1% to close on $44.29 on Nov 24, following the announcement, apparently reflecting strong competition Spotlight is expected to face from TikTok. Snap\u2019s shares have returned 171.3% year to date compared with the Zacks Internet - Software industry\u2019s growth of 89.4%. On Snapchat, likes are private with no options for re-sharing of videos. Moreover, displaying follower numbers is optional. Without such metrics, it can be tough for Spotlight videos to get popular, thus affecting chances of users to get noticed by brands and advertisers or get hired to create sponsored content. Additionally, Spotlight content will be moderated by human reviewers and AI before it gets to 100 views and will not be distributed further until it has passed moderation. Snapchat user profiles are individual by default, so snaps will not be instantly pressed to a big audience. Moreover, those who share Snaps from a private account will also see their account details remain private on Spotlight. Public comments on videos are not allowed. Nonetheless, the company confirmed that as an early incentive for users to try out the new feature, it will give over $1 million dollars every day until the end of this year to those who create the most engaging Snaps on Spotlight. Markedly, users must be over 16 and where applicable get parental consent to be considered for the funds. With over 249 million daily active users reported at the end of third-quarter 2020, Snap is looking to leverage more than 4 billion daily Snaps created by its users to power the new Spotlight feed. Creative video-sharing has become increasingly popular on social media platforms, accelerated by the rise of TikTok, which remains one of the top apps with around 50 million daily active users (DAUs) in the United States till August. TikTok plans to spend more than $1 billion in the next three years on video-makers in the United States. Over the weekend, TikTok saw its first creator reach 100 million followers. Charli D\u2019Amelio has hit that mark just 18 months after she created her account. TikTok\u2019s success led Alphabet owned Google to add short-form videos to its YouTube app. Meanwhile, Facebook has added an equivalent function in the type of Reels for Instagram. Instagram has been paying some of TikTok\u2019s top stars to test out Reels. Moreover, Instagram recently started sharing revenues for the first time on video ads with creators like YouTube does. Nonetheless, Snap is expected to intensify competition for its peers, given its strong popularity among millennials. Competition among social media apps for the attention of younger users has been intense and most notable is the case of Snapchat\u2019s disappearing Stories feature, which has since then been introduced to LinkedIn, Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, among others, earlier this month. Markedly, in the United States, Snapchat platform reaches 90% of 13-24 year-olds, which is more than Facebook, Instagram and Messenger combined. It also reaches 75% of all 13 to 34-year-olds and more than 4 billion Snaps are created every day on an average. Moreover, with the music licensing aspect handled by this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company\u2019s multi-year licensing agreements with several major record labels including Warner Music Group, Universal Music Publishing Group, Warner Chappell Music, Kobalt and BMG Music Publishing, the Spotlight feature is expected to gain popularity soon. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. It could become the mother of all technological revolutions. Apple sold a mere 1 billion iPhones in 10 years but a new breakthrough is expected to generate more than 27 billion devices in just 3 years, creating a $1.7 trillion market. Zacks has just released a Special Report that spotlights this fast-emerging phenomenon and 6 tickers for taking advantage of it.

    "headline":"No Google-Fitbit merger without human rights remedies, says Amnesty to EU",
    "url":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/no-google-fitbit-merger-without-141740540.html",
    "article_text":"Amnesty warns now that Google is \"incentivized to merge and aggregate data across its different platforms\" as a consequence of that surveillance-based business model. \"Google\u2019s business model incentivizes the company to continuously seek more data on more people across the online world and into the physical world. The merger with Fitbit is a clear example of this expansionist approach to data extraction, enabling the company to extend its data collection into the health and wearables sector,\" it writes. \"The sheer scale of the intrusion of Google\u2019s business model into our private lives is an unprecedented interference with our privacy, and in fact has undermined the very essence of privacy.\" We've reached out to the commission and Google for a response to Amnesty's letter. Update: A commission spokesperson confirmed it's received the letter and said it will reply in due course. The commission has also voiced concerns about the risk of Google locking other wearable device makers out of its Android mobile ecosystem. However concerns over Google's plan to gobble up Fitbit range wider than the risk of it getting more market muscle if the deal gets waved through. Put simply, letting sensitive health data fall into the hands of an advertising giant is a privacy trash fire. The commission's decision to scrutinize the acquisition rather than waiving it through with a cursory look has led Google to make a number of concessions in an attempt to get it cleared -- including a pledge not to use Fitbit data for ad targeting and to guarantee support for other wearables makers to operate on Android. In its letter, Amnesty argues that the \"safeguards\" Google has offered are not enough. \"The European Data Protection Board has recognized the risks of the merger, stating that the \u201ccombination and accumulation of sensitive personal data\u201d by Google could entail a \u201chigh level of risk\u201d to the rights to privacy and data protection,\" it adds. As well as undermining people's privacy, Google's use of algorithms fed with personal data to generate profiles of internet users in order to predict their behavior erodes what Amnesty describes as \"the critical principle that all people should enjoy equal access to their human rights.\" \"This risk is heightened when profiling is deployed in contexts that touch directly on people\u2019s economic, social and cultural rights, such as the right to health where people may suffer unequal treatment based on predictions about their health, and as such must be taken into account in the context of health and fitness data,\" it suggests. \"This power of the platforms has not only exacerbated and magnified their rights impacts but has also created a situation in which it is very difficult to hold the companies to account, or for those affected to access an effective remedy,\" Amnesty adds, noting that while big tech companies have faced a number of regulatory actions around the world none has so far been able to derail what it calls \"the fundamental drivers of the surveillance-based business model.\" So far the commission has stood firm in taking its time to consider the issue in detail. Per EU merger law, the commission college takes the final decision -- with a requirement to take \"utmost account\" of the opinion of the member states' advisory committee (though it's not legally binding). So it's ultimately up to Brussels to determine whether Google-Fitbit gets green lit. She has also voiced opposition to breaking up tech giants, again preferring to advocate for imposing controls on how they can use data as a way to rebalance digital markets. Simultaneously, EU lawmakers are working on a proposal for an ex ante regulation to address competition concerns in digital markets that would put specific rules and obligations on dominant players like Google -- again in areas such as data use and data access. That plan is due to be presented early next month -- so it's another factor that may be adding to delay the commission's Google-Fitbit decision."

    "article_text":"(Bloomberg) -- New York-based businesswoman Ruth Harrigan usually sells her honey and beeswax products in souvenir shops. But with Covid-19 pausing tourism, she\u2019s been almost entirely dependent on Facebook ads to drive online sales. On Nov. 11, this new financial lifeline was abruptly cut when the social media company blocked her HoneyGramz ad account for violating its policies. She couldn\u2019t imagine what about her tiny honey-filled gifts would have triggered the problem. Friends told Harrigan to just wait a couple of days and the problem might resolve itself. She waited, until she lost an estimated $5,000 in revenue. \u201cI was getting a little anxious thinking, \u2018Oh my God, Black Friday is around the corner, most of my sales for the year happen in November and December and that\u2019s it,\u2019\u201d she explained. \u201cI said, \u2018If I\u2019m shut down any longer than this, it\u2019ll cripple me.\u2019\u201d Harrigan is one of millions of small business advertisers who have come to rely on Facebook Inc. because the coronavirus has shut down many traditional retail channels. The social media giant has provided new sales opportunities for these entrepreneurs, but also exposed them to the company\u2019s misfiring content-moderation software, limited options for customer support and lack of transparency about how to fix problems. Facebook\u2019s human moderators have focused on election and Covid-19 misinformation this year, so the company has leaned more on artificial intelligence algorithms to monitor other areas of the platform. That\u2019s left many small businesses caught in Facebook\u2019s automated filters, unable to advertise through the service and frustrated because they don\u2019t know why. The same weekend Harrigan\u2019s account went down, Ivonne Sanchez, who runs a permanent makeup clinic in Ottawa, found her ads were blocked too, for what Facebook said was a \u201cpolicy violation.\u201d Her business, which had to shut down between March and June for the pandemic, was relying on Facebook to recover financially. The account was restored the next day without explanation, but \u201cin the middle of a crucial shopping season, it left us shaken,\u201d she said. \u201cThis experience makes us very nervous about investing dollars into a system that is operated seemingly by a bot.\u201d \u201cIt just exploded. They turned up the AI recently -- somebody changed something -- and all of the sudden everybody was getting shut down.\u201d -- Justin Brooke, founder of Adskills.com Even if an ad account gets restored, businesses lose crucial momentum. Facebook\u2019s advertising algorithm takes a couple of weeks to figure out which users may be interested in an ad, to refine the targeting. Jessica Grossman, chief executive officer of digital marketing firm In Social, said when her clients get hit, the hardest part is telling them their campaigns have to start over and their money won\u2019t go as far. \u201cFacebook almost doesn\u2019t realize the impact of their own algorithm and what that means,\u201d Grossman said. There seemed to be no logic to the account bans imposed on In Social\u2019s clients, she added. A pizza vending machine company, a reusable water bottle company, a coffee delivery service, a business coach and a hair weave company were all suspended. \u201cWe know it can be frustrating to experience any type of business disruption, especially at such a critical time of the year,\u201d Facebook said in a statement. \u201cWhile we offer free support for all businesses, we regularly work to improve our tools and systems, and to make the support we offer easier to use and access. We apologize for any inconvenience recent disruptions may have caused.\u201d Facebook often touts its commitment to small businesses, as it defends its ever larger hold over their economic future. On a recent earnings call, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said this was a \u201cmajor focus\u201d that\u2019s \u201cmore important now than ever\u201d as Covid-19 shifts commerce online. During a July ad boycott by major brands, Facebook\u2019s revenue still grew, bolstered by small businesses rushing online to try to survive. The company added more tools this year for small businesses to sell directly to customers through its site, hoping these virtual shops become advertisers, too. But while business owners agree that Facebook is a lifeline during the pandemic, they say it\u2019s also an unreliable partner. Facebook\u2019s ban on political ads around the U.S. election, for instance, affected companies that have no connection to politics, like a business selling bracelets to benefit refugees. A seed company was also blocked for sharing a picture of Walla Walla onions -- which were \u201covertly sexual,\u201d according to Facebook\u2019s AI. The company\u2019s policies against cryptocurrency frequently trapped ads from a solar roof company, Human SOLR, because some of the acronyms used by the business are similar to cryptocurrency tokens. After that issue was resolved, Human SOLR\u2019s ads were banned again for using phrases like \u201csee if your roof qualifies.\u201d Facebook\u2019s software guessed the company was selling financial products, which are more regulated. After enough flags on the account, Brett Lee, who runs the business, gave up on Facebook ads. \u201cMy business is at a complete standstill,\u201d said Lee, based in St. George, Utah. \u201cMy employees\u2019 lives are at a standstill.\u201d GFP Delivered, a Chicago-based produce company advertising a way for people to avoid the grocery store during Covid-19, had its Facebook ads shut down for two months without clear explanation, according to owner George Fourkas. He said he was able to fix the problem only after reaching out to old college friends who work at Facebook. Yaniv Gershom, co-founder of digital marketing firm 4AM Media, said he had to cut 12 jobs partly because of Facebook ad account bans, which have lasted almost six months. \u201cThey give you zero feedback,\u201d he added. \u201cThe only people who are OK are massive spenders who get a Facebook rep that can escalate issues and find out what\u2019s wrong.\u201d In some cases, the business impact is hard to quantify. Matt Snow, co-founder of an apparel business called Boredwalk, said Facebook\u2019s automated systems inadvertently flagged 40% of his company\u2019s product catalog as unsafe late last month. That left Snow targeting the wrong products to potential customers. He eventually noticed and quickly resolved the issue with a Facebook sales manager, but Snow doesn\u2019t know how long the products were banned, or even which other items were being advertised in their place. \u201cFacebook is very black box about all their internal machinations,\u201d he said. Facebook has been automating content moderation for years, a transition it highlights in a quarterly report detailing how much content the company removes. In more nuanced categories such as \u201chate speech,\u201d Facebook removed almost 95% of violating posts automatically in the third quarter, up from just 53% two years ago. But that increase comes with more corrections. Facebook removed 22 million posts for hate speech in the third quarter, more than 3 times as many as a year earlier. The number of posts it later restored jumped by 40%. Appealing these often-automated decisions has also become a lot harder. \u201cDue to a temporary reduction in our review capacity as a result of Covid-19, we could not always offer our users the option to appeal,\u201d Facebook wrote in its third-quarter report. Advertisers have been particularly hurt by these automated decisions in recent months. \u201cIt just exploded. They turned up the AI recently -- somebody changed something -- and all of the sudden everybody was getting shut down,\u201d said Justin Brooke, founder of Adskills.com, which teaches businesses how to market on Facebook. \u201cWhat are these small businesses going to do? They\u2019ve got families to feed.\u201d One of Brooke\u2019s own Facebook ads has a small written disclaimer saying it wasn\u2019t open to those trying to sell adult content. That got flagged and taken down. Facebook\u2019s automated explanation? The post didn\u2019t follow the company\u2019s community standards on \u201cnudity\/sexual activity.\u201d The over-reaction by Facebook\u2019s AI is a side effect of the company taking more responsibility for the content on its platform, according to Guy Rosen, Facebook\u2019s vice president of integrity. \u201cAs we take more action, we remove more content, there\u2019s more opportunities also for those to be in error,\u201d he said during a recent press call. That\u2019s what HoneyGramz\u2019s Harrigan was told happened to her account. She eventually got desperate enough to Google names of Facebook employees who might help. She found Rob Leathern, the company\u2019s director of ad products, and sent him a message on Twitter. Miraculously, he responded. A few hours later, Facebook sent an email restoring her account. \u201cThey just said they turned it off in error,\u201d Harrigan said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t give me any feedback. They just reset the whole thing as if it never happened.\u201d But Harrigan won\u2019t forget. She printed off the email and pinned it to her office whiteboard. \u201cIt was really, really scary,\u201d she said. (Adds chart after ninth paragraph.) \u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P."

But the price-to-sale and price-to-earnings ratios you see below show that Tesla's valuation is insanely high compared to these companies.\u00a0 The excitement about Tesla's business is understandable. Customers are extremely loyal and love their vehicles. But I think disruption is coming to the auto business long before Tesla lives up to its current valuation, and that's why the stock has run too far, too fast.\u00a0 Several popular EV names in the U.S. aren't yet in production. One that actually does have a product and is on investors' radar is electric-delivery truck maker Workhorse Group.\u00a0 Workhorse's niche is the \"last mile\" box truck for short-distance deliveries. Its two C-Series electric trucks offer 650- or 1000-cubic- foot cargo space, and have 100 miles of range. While there's a good reason for interest in this company, its 2021 production volume target is just 1,800 vehicles.\u00a0 The company has also applied for Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certification for its HorseFly unmanned drone \"that can deliver parcels, carry sensors and cameras and operate autonomously with a high degree of precision.\"\u00a0 While there's reason to like Workhorse for its long-term potential, there are many hurdles, including potential competition, for it to be a successful business. Its valuation today looks well beyond what is reasonable, making it a prime candidate to retrench when investors focus their excitement elsewhere. I'm betting this one has run too far, too fast.\u00a0 That's an incredible haul if you picked up shares of the micro-cap company earlier this year. The problem is, with a market cap now approaching $1 billion, the market is now paying an insanely high multiple for the company's future prospects.\u00a0 As the chart shows, Blink's cash burn rate is accelerating, meaning it will need to raise more cash, and probably relatively soon. With the stock price having raced higher, management would be smart to take advantage of this opportunity to raise cash with a secondary offering -- even with the downside for investors being dilution as a result. Frankly, Blink needs\u00a0to be spending money to build out its business now.\u00a0 But at almost 200 times sales, don't count me among the investors looking to buy shares of the company just yet. The business is just too small, and there's a lot of risk if it doesn't get a secure enough foothold in the EV charging business to deliver on the growth potential. Today's nearly billion-dollar valuation could run out of juice even more quickly than it charged up.\u00a0 The electric vehicle industry is growing, and there's a lot to like long-term. But the automotive industry isn't typically a very profitable industry, and there's a limit to how many vehicles people will buy in a year. That should put some trepidation into the market, and these three stocks could fall back to earth if the growth story is upset in any way.\u00a0 Stock Advisor launched in February of 2002.

In August, Guardant Health's Guardant360 CDx became the first liquid biopsy test approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for comprehensive tumor mutation profiling across all solid cancers. Liquid biopsies are tests that analyze DNA fragments of tumors in the blood. Comprehensive tumor mutation profiling enables the identification of specific types of cancers, which can be used to determine the most effective treatment.\u00a0 Guardant Health is on track to generate revenue of close to $300 million this year. That's only a drop in the bucket compared to the $6 billion potential U.S. market that Guardant360 CDx targets.\u00a0 The market for Guardant360 also pales in comparison to the estimated total addressable U.S. market of more than $45 billion for Guardant Health's LUNAR liquid biopsy tests. The company is evaluating two tests in clinical studies: LUNAR-1 for cancer recurrence monitoring and adjuvant (secondary) cancer treatment and LUNAR-2 for early stage cancer detection. If these products are successful, Guardant Health will become a much bigger company over the next few years. The company offers arguably the best cloud-based database on the market. In October, MongoDB announced that its Atlas product is the first cloud database that enables customers to run applications simultaneously on all major cloud providers -- Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure. This could be a big draw for customers who want to leverage the strengths offered by each cloud provider. Organizations are flocking to the cloud. The COVID-19 pandemic has only accelerated this migration. At the end of 2019, MongoDB claimed more than 15,900 customers in over 100 countries. Its customer count now tops 20,200, with nearly 19,000 of them using Atlas.\u00a0 Despite its tremendous growth, MongoDB's market cap is still only around $15.5 billion. The company remains a much smaller player than the leaders in the database market. This relatively small size combined with an enormous market should give MongoDB plenty of room to run. This company is a textbook case of being in the right place at the right time. The Trade Desk markets the leading software platform for advertisers to buy digital ads. The rise of connected TV (CTV) -- televisions connected to the internet -- has created a massive opportunity for digital advertising. The company plans to launch one of its biggest platform upgrades ever in 2021. The last big upgrade in 2018 fueled significant market share gains for The Trade Desk. If history repeats itself, more big gains could be right around the corner. With CTV still only in its early stages, The Trade Desk should remain in the right place at the right time for years to come. Stock Advisor launched in February of 2002. Returns as of 11\/28\/2020."

    "article_text":"The UK will impose new rules next year aimed at preventing Google and Facebook from abusing their market dominance. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said the two firms accounted for around 80% of the \u00a314bn ($18.7bn) spent on advertising online in 2019. The new regime will attempt to give consumers more control over their data. It will also \"help small businesses thrive, and ensure news outlets are not forced out by bigger rivals,\" according to the government. \"There is growing consensus in the UK and abroad that the concentration of power among a small number of tech companies is curtailing growth of the sector, reducing innovation and having negative impacts on the people and businesses that rely on them,\" said Digital Secretary Oliver Dowden, in a statement. \"It's time to address that and unleash a new age of tech growth.\" The new code will set clear expectations for the most powerful firms over what represents acceptable behaviour when interacting with competitors and users. Platforms that are funded by digital advertising could be required to be more transparent about the services they provide and how they are using consumers' data. They will be expected to give consumers a choice over whether to receive personalised advertising, and prevented from placing restrictions on their customers that make it hard for them to use rival platforms. The code will be enforced by a new dedicated unit within the CMA. The Digital Markets Unit could be given powers to suspend, block and reverse decisions made by technology firms and to impose financial penalties for non-compliance. Google and Facebook have previously said they are committed to working with the British government and regulator on digital advertising. The new code could also affect the media industry, which has lost much of its advertising revenues to Facebook and Google. The new code will attempt to govern commercial arrangements between publishers and platforms to help keep publishers in business. It will try to stop online platforms from imposing unfair terms on news publishers that limit their ability to monetise their content."

    "url":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/jamie-oliver-turns-leftover-mashed-060015576.html",
    "article_text":"(Bloomberg) -- Editor\u2019s Note: As more people are working from home, Bloomberg Pursuits is running a weekly Lunch Break column that highlights a notable recipe from a favorite cookbook and the hack that makes it genius. This holiday season, let\u2019s gives thanks for mashed potatoes. They are the MVPs of the industry, a mainstay of weekday dinners, and the anchor of so many festive dinners. According to Google Trends data, they have been, unsurprisingly, the most popular side dish for American Thanksgiving. Mashed potatoes are, however, invariably a supporting player behind more muscular turkeys, prime ribs, roast chicken, and anything that might come with a bowl of gravy. Jamie Oliver invites you to rethink the possibilities. The ever-popular British cook catapulted to international prominence as the Naked Chef in the late \u201990s. Now, he might be known as the Data Chef. In his new cookbook, 7 Ways: Easy Ideas for Every Day of the Week (Flatiron Books; $35), Oliver worked with major supermarkets across the U.K. to determine the ingredients consumers buy most. \u201cMy dream was to try and write the most accessible cookbook I\u2019ve ever written,\u201d says Oliver via a phone interview. What that means, he adds, is considering what people have on hand, as well as cost, variety, and of course, flavor. \u201cI used data to drive this creation. It\u2019s not glamorous, and I don\u2019t typically like it, but it\u2019s fascinating. We were churning through thousands of items at major supermarkets. I wanted to study food that most of us buy every week.\u201d From his research, Oliver determined 30 of the most popular foods purchased at supermarkets. He then selected 18 to feature in his book\u2014seven different ways, per the title\u2014with the goal of staving off boredom for home cooks whose supermarket habits are on repeat. They\u2019re all obvious and accessible: salmon, chicken breasts, avocado, shrimp. His steak chapter, for instance, includes South American-styled chimichurri, a Chinese stir-fry with ginger, and a pepper-crusted number with whisky sauce. Likewise, Oliver\u2019s potato chapter ranges from Indian-accented baked potatoes to a potato \u201clasagna\u201d (aka gratin) made by layering slices in a creamy cheese sauce. Most compelling is his savory pie with a mashed potato \u201ccrust.\u201d \u201cI pair spring onions and tomatoes with oozy cheese to create the perfect flavor contrast with the soft, creamy mash\u2014which also has a pleasingly crispy outer edge,\u201d says Oliver. In fact, the dish radiates comfort. Oliver calls for two kinds of cheddar in his dish, but it\u2019s wide open to interpretation. \u201cFeel free to mix up the cheese, based on what you\u2019ve got.\u201d The most important part is the golden potato crust. While mashed potatoes feature as a topping for such classics as shepherd\u2019s pie and moussaka, it\u2019s not so common to find them working as the bottom layer, too. Though it\u2019s firm enough to cut into slices, the pie could double as a dressed-up casserole. You could just spoon it onto plates in one gorgeous pile. The tomatoes add a refreshing bite but they\u2019re not necessary. Hot sauce makes a great addition, if you\u2019re so inclined. Even as everyone is scaling down this year\u2019s Thanksgiving feast, it\u2019s hard not to overestimate how much mashed potatoes you\u2019ll want. Leftovers are inevitable\u2014and now, very welcome. \u201cThis one is perfect if you\u2019ve made a bumper batch of mash,\u201d says Oliver, and then shouts: \u201cHappy holidays!\u201d The following recipe is adapted from 7 Ways: Easy Ideas for Every Day of the Week, by Jamie Oliver. Testers Note: This recipe works best with drier mashed potatoes, ones made without excessive milk and butter. Of course, that\u2019s not what most people want for Thanksgiving. If you have extra creamy mashed potatoes, cook them down so they\u2019re as dense as possible. Mash in an additional boiled potato or two, if you have them. If you have less mashed potato, you can make this pie in a smaller baking dish, with less filling. It\u2019s supremely adaptable. Crispy Cheesy Mashed Potato Pie Serves 4 to 6 3 lb. Yukon gold potatoes; if using leftover mashed potatoes, you\u2019ll need about 6 cups2\/3 lb. ripe tomatoes (optional)1 large bunch of scallions, sliced 3 oz. sharp cheddar cheese, coarsely grated 3 oz. aged cheddar, coarsely gratedSalt and freshly ground pepper4 tbsp. unsalted butter, or to tasteExtra virgin olive oil, for brushingHot sauce, for serving (optional) Peel the potatoes and chop into even-sized chunks. Cook in a large pan of boiling salted water until tender, about 15 minutes. Meanwhile, if using tomatoes, halve them, squeeze out the seeds, and dice the flesh. Toss with a good pinch of sea salt and transfer to a sieve to drain. Press out any excess liquid from the tomatoes and mix with the scallions and cheese. Check for seasoning. Preheat the oven to 400F. Drain the potatoes, then mash really well with the butter and season to perfection. Once cool enough to handle, use oiled hands to flatten a little more than half the mashed potatoes in the bottom and a bit up the sides of a 12- by 8-inch nonstick baking pan. Spread the tomato-cheese mixture over the bottom, almost to the edges. Press the remaining mashed potatoes on top, smoothing it out and covering the filling. Make a pattern, if you like on the edge. Brush the top of the pie with olive oil and bake for about 40 minutes, or until golden and crisp. Let cool slightly, then slice. Serve with hot sauce, if desired. \u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P."

    "headline":"Here's Why Electric Vehicle Stocks Have Exploded This Year",
    "url":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/heres-why-electric-vehicle-stocks-000000977.html",
    "article_text":"The electric vehicle boom has been one of the few bright spots for investors in 2020. Tesla has seen its stock price climb by more than 445% this year. NIO stocks have soared by more than 1070%. And even charging companies like PLUG have seen their stock prices rise by more than 630%. In what has been a perfect storm for this nascent sector, traditional companies have seen their value destroyed, the world\u2019s biggest hedge funds have started to redirect their investments towards ESG stocks and multiple governments are preparing for a clean energy transition as the COVID recovery begins. But amidst all this good news - and what seems to be an irreversible shift in sentiment in global markets - one of the most impressive EV developments of the decade seems to have gone under the radar. The EV industry has finally solved its most pressing problem: accessibility. Electric vehicles are finally making the move from being a luxury for the rich to the transportation of the many.\u00a0 The electric vehicle revolution is well and truly underway, and for investors, 2020 is only the beginning.\u00a0 Solving A Major EV Problem Despite all the hype around electric vehicles and the incredible rate of technological breakthroughs, the truth is that sales of electric vehicles are increasing at a painfully slow rate. There are two main reasons for this. Electric vehicles are yet to reach price competitiveness with gasoline-powered cars. The rate of improvement in the technology means any EV you buy today will likely be outdated within a year or two. But all of that is about to change. Because when electric cars become the norm, the entire model of the auto industry will have to change.\u00a0 Just like we all race to get the latest iPhone model or the most modern computer \u2013 our desire for the newest electric vehicle will be undeniable.\u00a0 An electric vehicle subscription service like Steer will not only solve the single biggest problem that the EV industry faces, ultimately it could help make electric vehicles the only acceptable choice for most consumers. An ESG Revolution By now, the entire investment world is aware of the Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) trend that is taking over markets.\u00a0 The CEO of the world\u2019s largest asset manager, Blackrock, believes that we are \u201con the edge of a fundamental reshaping of finance\u201d. And when a company with more than $7 trillion under management says markets are about to change, it\u2019s generally a good idea to listen. For Facedrive this transformation could not have come at a better time. The company is determined to become the first-ever entirely ESG ecosystem, working on everything from emissions-free transportation and food delivery, to community-centered social and sports apps, and a COVID-tracing system designed to counter the global pandemic.\u00a0 It\u2019s a business model that has sent Facedrive\u2019s market cap above $1 billion and has forced industry giants to go on the defensive. Ultimately, the era of public companies chasing profit at the expense of all else is essentially over. For a modern company to be viable, it must account for and counter any negative impact on local communities or the environment. As the ESG revolution picks up pace, this people-and-planet first approach to business has already grabbed the attention of some incredibly powerful and influential figures. Big Names Making Big Moves It is no secret that some of the biggest names in investment, tech, and finance are determined to use their money for good. Elon Musk, Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, and nearly every other tech billionaire have committed huge sums of money to their pursuit of \u2018making the world a better place\u2019. Facebook\u2019s purchase of Steer has seen energy giant Exelon come on board. And the COVID tracing technology developed by Facedrive got support from Air Canada, the Canadian government, and Microsoft. Facedrive has found itself at a crossroads where big names, big money, and big ideas are all colliding.\u00a0 And now its electric vehicle subscription service is promising to help accelerate the hottest investment sector of 2020. As far as Facedrive is concerned, the future has already arrived. Other Companies Riding The ESG Wave Tech giants are among the leaders in the sustainability push. Facebook, Microsoft, Apple and Google have all made massive commitments to the cause, paving a path for others in the industry to do the same. In 2019, Facebook became the number one corporate buyer of renewable energy in the United States, and second in the world. It has also made major investments in developing renewable projects in Texas, Ireland, Denmark and Norway. Facebook has even gone a step further with its focus on building more sustainable workplaces. It\u2019s building designs incorporate a number of renewable energy sources and water recycling methods, in addition to promoting the recycling and sustainability of all products consumed on site. The tech giant has made numerous investments in clean energy across the globe. From Ohio to the Netherlands, Microsoft is pouring millions into solar and wind projects to not only help reduce its own carbon footprint, but also help neighboring communities do the same. In addition to its investments and green operations, Microsoft is also building the next generation of hardware and software to help the world reduce its dependence on fossil fuels. Its Azure IoT, for example, connects and manages internet-connected solar panels to improve efficiency and open a line for an entirely new way of sharing energy within communities. Conor Kelly, the software engineer who is leading the distributed solar energy project for Microsoft Azure IoT explained, \u201cWe need to decarbonize the global economy to avoid catastrophic climate change,\u201d adding, \u201cThe first thing we can do, and the easiest thing we can do, is focus on electricity.\u201d Its focus is on raising the bar for smarter and more efficient use of the world\u2019s limited resources. It is building sustainable, energy-efficient data centers and workplaces. It is also harnessing artificial intelligence to utilize energy more efficiently. \u00a0 Google CEO Sundar Pichai explained, \u201cWe are committed to doing our part. Sustainability has been a core value for us since Larry and Sergey founded Google two decades ago. We were the first major company to become carbon neutral in 2007. We were the first major company to match our energy use with 100 percent renewable energy in 2017. We operate the cleanest global cloud in the industry, and we\u2019re the world\u2019s largest corporate purchaser of renewable energy.\u201d Apple has made significant moves towards renewables. All of Apple\u2019s operations run on 100% renewable energy, and it is even extending this philosophy to its distributors and manufacturers. Not only have they decreased their average product\u2019s energy use by 70 percent. They\u2019ve reduced their total carbon footprint by more than 35 percent in just a few short years. All while securing the title as the World\u2019s First Trillion Dollar Company \"We proved that 100 percent renewable is 100 percent doable. All our facilities worldwide\u2014including Apple offices, retail stores, and data centers\u2014are now powered entirely by clean energy. But this is just the beginning of how we\u2019re reducing greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to climate change. We\u2019re continuing to go further than most companies in measuring our carbon footprint, including manufacturing and product use. And we\u2019re making great progress in those areas too,\" CEO Tim Cook explained. As such, Total is not only betting big on renewable energy, it is also doing its part in reducing emissions in its day-to-day activities. Patrick Pouyann\u00e9, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer at Total noted, \u201cIt\u2019s our job to meet growing energy needs while reducing carbon emissions.\u201d It's also one of the most conscious companies in the business. Total checks every box in the ESG checklist. It is promoting diversity and safety, making massive changes in its operations to ensure that its business is environmentally sound, and has even committed to going carbon neutral by 2050 or sooner. It\u2019s no surprise that shareholders are loving its forward-thinking approach. Canadian companies are doing their part as well:  Telecom giant Shaw Communications Inc (TSE:SJR.B) is a great example. Shaw is taking a leadership role among Canadian telecom providers through its use of renewable energy, In fact, it is one of the biggest customers of Bullfrog Power which sources its electricity from a blend of wind energy and hydropower. It is also building its own portfolio of clean energy investments. In addition to its green energy investments, it\u2019s also embarked on an initiative to power its data centers with renewables and even implemented software to create more efficient routes for its drivers which will reduce BCE Inc (TSX:BCE)) is another Canadian telecom giant going to great lengths to reduce its carbon footprint. In fact, the company was named one of Canada\u2019s greenest employers in 2019. For the past 25 years, BCE has been at the forefront of the environmental movement. Their environmental management system (EMS) has been certified to be ISO 14001-compliant since 2009. In addition to its sustainability push, BCE is also a great place to work. It\u2019s one of the country\u2019s top family-friendly employers and has magnificent hiring practices, making it a great pick for ESG investors. Boralex Inc. (TSX:BLX) is a homegrown Canadian renewable firm. It has had a great influence in the adoption of renewable electricity domestically, and it\u2019s even branching out into the United States, France, and the United Kingdom. The company\u2019s primary energies are produced through wind, hydroelectric, thermal, and solar sources and help power the homes of many people across the world. Canada\u2019s Silicon Valley is joining the ESG race, too. Shopify Inc (TSX:SH) Canada\u2019s own e-commerce giant helps users build their own online stores. It has huge clients \u2013 everyone from Tesla to Budweiser are on board. And the company is beloved by millennial investors. In addition to its revolutionary approach to e-commerce, Shopify is playing an increasingly active role in creating a greener tomorrow. It has committed to spending at least $5 million annually to help combat climate change. It\u2019s even making cuts throughout its own operations, decommissioning its data centers, and sourcing renewable power for its buildings. By. Michael Kern **IMPORTANT!

The commission's ambitious agenda for updating and expanding the EU's digital rules framework, means criticism of GDPR risks taking the shine off the DGA before the ink has dried on the proposal document -- putting pressure on lawmakers to find creative ways to unblock GDPR's enforcement \"bottleneck.\" (Creative because national agencies are responsible for day-to-day oversight, and member states are responsible for resourcing DPAs.)

This includes concerns of the Irish DPC making unnecessary \"information and admissibility checks;\" as well as rejecting complaints brought by an interested organization on the grounds they lack a mandate under Irish law, because it does not allow for third party redress (yet the Dutch consumer organization had filed the complaint under Dutch law which does \u2026). The report also queries why the DPC chose to open its own volition inquiry into Google's location data activities (rather than a complaint-led inquiry) -- which Beuc says risks a further delay to reaching a decision on the complaints themselves. It further points out that the DPC's probe of Google only looks at activity since February 2020 not November 2018 when the complaints were made -- meaning there's a missing chunk of Google's location data processing that's not even being investigated yet. The report also points out the inherent imbalance of GDPR's one-stop-shop mechanism shifting the administration of complaints to the location of companies under investigation -- arguing they therefore benefit from \"easier access to justice\" (versus the ordinary consumer faced with undertaking legal proceedings in a different country and (likely) language). \"If the lead authority is in a country with tradition in \u2018common law,\u2019 like Ireland, things can become even more complex and costly,\" Beuc's report further notes. Another issue it raises is the overarching one of rights complaints having to fight what it dubs \"a moving target\" -- given well-resourced tech companies can leverage regulatory delays to (superficially) tweak practices, greasing continued abuse with misleading PR campaigns. (Something Beuc accuses Google of doing.) DPAs must \"adapt their enforcement approach to intervene more rapidly and directly.\" it concludes. \"Over two years have passed since the GDPR became applicable, we have now reached a turning point. The GDPR must finally show its strength and become a catalyst for urgently needed changes in business practices,\" Beuc goes on in a summary of its recommendations. \"Our members experience and that of other civil society organisations, reveals a series of obstacles that significantly hamper the effective application of the GDPR and the correct functioning of its enforcement system. We reached out to the Commission and the Irish DPC with questions about the report. But at the time of writing neither had responded. We've also asked Google for comment. Update: The DPC's deputy commissioner, Graham Doyle, told us the reason it chose to open a \"forward-looking\" inquiry into Google's location practices in early 2020 was it wanted to be able to investigate \"in real time\" rather than try to go back and replicate how things were. Doyle also said the location-related Google complaints had been lodged with different DPAs at difference times -- meaning some complaints had taken considerably longer to reach Ireland than November 2018, raising questions about the efficiency of the current procedures for European DPAs to send complaints to a lead supervisor. \"The complaints in question were lodged with different Supervisory Authorities on different dates from November 2018,\" he said. \"The DPC received these complaints in July 2019, following which we engaged with Beuc. We then opened an own-volition inquiry in February 2020 in a manner that will enable us to undertake real-time testing in order to evidence our findings.\" It also said that it would \"continue to use all the tools at its disposal to foster compliance by member states with their obligations\" -- including, potentially, instigating infringement procedures if necessary. Additional follow-up actions related to \"implementing and complementing\" the legal framework that it detailed in the report included supporting \"further exchanges of views and national practices between member states on topics that are subject to further specification at national level so as to reduce the level of fragmentation of the single market, such as processing of personal data relating to health and research, or which are subject to balancing with other rights such as the freedom of expression;\" and to push for \"a consistent application of the data protection framework in relation to new technologies to support innovation and technological developments.\"  The commission also said it would use the GDPR Member States Expert Group to \"facilitate discussions and sharing of experience between member states and with the commission,\" with a view to improving the regulation's operation. In the area of GDPR's governance system, EU lawmakers committed to continue to monitor the effectiveness and independence of national DPAs, and said they would work to encourage cooperation between regulators (\"in particular in fields such as competition, electronic communications, security of network and information systems and consumer policy\"), while also supporting the EDPB to assess how procedures related to cross-border cases could be improved."

Technology has reached a point where it is leaving no stone in the global economy unturned, and this has become increasingly apparent in healthcare. More specifically, a confluence of mobility and high-speed internet access, cloud computing, and analytics have made remote care via phone or teleconference a reality -- and it turns out a pandemic is all that was needed to spur mass adoption. Image source: Getty Images. In 2015, a very small company named Teladoc pioneering a novel means of delivering care via the internet made its public debut. Fast forward a few years, and Teladoc is quickly becoming a well-known name in the medical sphere. But with a market cap of $28 billion in a global industry that accounts for trillions of dollars in spending every year, Teladoc is still in the very early chapters of its growth story. \u00a0 In short, while the pandemic might be inflating the growth figures for Teladoc this year, virtual care has real benefits for patients. It increases patient access to primary care and specialty medical professionals, adds convenience to the equation (fewer trips to the doctor and less waiting around), and in turn, saves on cost. There is a long runway of growth ahead of this tiny industry. The potential for further shake-up of the global healthcare landscape is massive, and this is still a small-ish company that has the early lead in the race. I think I'll remain a buyer for the long term. Much like Teladoc, Amwell is also getting a boost in activity on its platform due to the pandemic. During the third quarter, total visits exploded to 1.41 million, compared to just 255,000 a year ago. Total revenue also increased 80% to $62.6 million. With respectable expansion during its first quarter as a public concern, why have shares pulled back? \u00a0 For one thing, Amwell is smaller than Teladoc, so expectations may have been set that its growth trajectory would outpace that of its larger peer. It's also worth noting that Amwell still operates at a loss. Free cash flow (revenue minus cash operating and capital expenses) was negative $94.1 million through the first nine months of 2020. Gross profit margin also fell to 32.7% for Amwell during the last quarter (down from 45.1% last year) because of lower-margin patient visits related to the pandemic. For the sake of comparison, Teladoc's gross margin was 62.7% over the last 12-month stretch.\u00a0  Stock Advisor launched in February of 2002. Returns as of 11\/28\/2020."

    "article_text":"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Hopes that vaccines will soon replace economic lockdowns as our best defense against the coronavirus have stirred speculation that value stocks will regain favor among investors. A guy who until recently oversaw $1.6 trillion has a strong argument that growth stocks will continue to be a better investment. Hiro Mizuno was chief investment officer of Japan\u2019s Government Pension Investment Fund for five years until the end of March. Now a Tesla Inc. board member and special adviser to Japan\u2019s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, here\u2019s what he tweeted at the weekend: Pitting the disruptive vision of entrepreneurs against the hopes of uncovering a real find amid the clutter of beaten down stocks provides a compelling way to frame the debate about whether growth stocks, classified as shares of companies with accelerating revenues, can keep outpacing value stocks, equities whose value is deemed not to reflect some measure of underlying worth. It seemed like the equation might be changing. Value stocks enjoyed a renaissance this month when vaccine euphoria prompted investors to rotate into shares trashed as the pandemic crimped the global economy. Their returns beat their growth counterparts by five percentage points in the first three weeks of November. That\u2019s sparked talk of a global revival. On Tuesday, Bank of America Corp. strategist Savita Subramanian recommended U.S. financial and energy stocks as her top two \u201cunapologetically cyclical and value-focused\u201d sectors. Strategists at Barclays Plc, led by Emmanuel Cau, on Wednesday recommended investors in European shares should overweight value versus growth. And John Woods, Credit Suisse Group AG\u2019s Asia Pacific CIO, said Asian value stocks will outperform in the next six months provided a vaccine becomes widely available. So could it finally be value stocks\u2019 turn in the sun? Investment advisers who\u2019ve called for a reversal of that trend have been proven wrong time and again. In the chart above, the biggest stocks in the Bloomberg Value Index include investment bank JPMorgan Chase & Co., telecoms operator AT&T Inc. and energy company Exxon Mobil Corp. The growth index is dominated by the FAANGS: Facebook Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Apple Inc., Netflix Inc. and Google\u2019s parent, Alphabet Inc. The picture doesn\u2019t change no matter the time period. So far this year, growth stocks have gained about 24%, while value stocks are down by 5%. In the past 12 months, growth is up by 28%, value down by 2.5%. Over three years, growth delivers 66% versus just 12% for value. And since early 2007, when the index histories begin, growth is up more than fourfold while value has a bit more than doubled in value. But hope for value stocks seems to spring eternal. A net 24% of investors overseeing $526 billion expect value to outperform growth the coming year, according to Bank of America\u2019s November survey. That\u2019s the most bullish call for value in the monthly poll since February 2019. Mizuno says that investment style fails to capture disruptors that sacrifice earnings early on to build a dominant market share. Jeff Bezos\u2019s Amazon is probably the best example of that kind of company. \u201cGrowth investing for me is to bet on the ability of CEO and his\/her staff to deliver more than people (including myself) can imagine,\u201d Mizuno also tweeted. By contrast, trying to identify value stocks takes a cocky \u2014 and risky \u2014 self-assurance that the wisdom of the investing crowd has missed something fundamental about a company\u2019s worth. If a share is cheap, it\u2019s probably cheap for a reason. You could even stretch the argument to cover the recent enthusiasm for Bitcoin versus gold. As my colleague Lionel Laurent recently pointed out, the digital currency barely figures in buying and selling in the real world and yet its gains have rapidly outpaced the yellow metal this year.Gold has real-world applications that make it inherently valuable, but many investors still view it as nothing more than a pet rock, limiting the potential universe of buyers. To its fans, Bitcoin represents a transformative technology with the potential to dislodge fiat currencies as a means of payment. In effect, it\u2019s a bet on the future of finance with a side wager that its momentum will continue apace \u2014 like a disruptive growth stock. The current enthusiasm for value stocks may well have further scope to run. But in the longer term, the trend that\u2019s been your friend seems likely to persist. Even once the pandemic is over, backing entrepreneurs will prove more profitable than buying allegedly undervalued equities in the hope that mean reversion will rescue them from the bargain basement.

    "article_text":"Corporates\u2019 relationship with renewable energy might not be as straightforward. For many companies, the cost of climate change, not\u00a0a change of heart, could be what has been forcing them to restrategize and reduce carbon footprints or think about reducing fossil fuel consumption. Nevertheless, corporate organizations have emerged among the biggest buyers of renewable energy. When it comes to which corners of the corporate world have been buying the most renewable energy, well, there are no surprises here as Big Tech easily takes the cake.\u00a0 However, the big surprise is that Big Oil, a sector that is frequently castigated for its outsized role in climate change, is beginning to make its presence felt here in a big way, too. Source: BNEF Big Oil to rival Big Tech\u00a0 Over the past half-decade or so, tech giants Google, Amazon, Facebook, and Microsoft have been dominating clean energy procurement and are looking to continue being renewable energy\u2019s biggest customers. These four internet giants operate massive, power-hungry data centers that have been blamed for their copious greenhouse gas emissions. It\u2019s, therefore, probably not surprising that they are putting some effort into ameliorating at least some of the damage. Big Tech might be the clear leader in the renewable energy space, but Big Oil might soon rival it. Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY), Chevron (NYSE:CVX) and Energy Transfer Partners (NYSE:ET) all signed solar contracts in 2019, following in the steps of ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM), which signed several large PPAs in 2018. Robust clean energy demand BNEF says that sustainability commitments as well as the powerful ESG megatrend will ensure that clean energy procurement from corporations continues to thrive. In fact, the energy watchdog estimates that last year\u2019s 221 RE100 companies will need to purchase an additional 210TWh of clean electricity in 2030 to meet their targets, which in turn will catalyze an estimated 105GW of new solar and wind build globally and nearly $100B in clean energy infrastructure. Source: BNEF But with RE100 membership expanding at such an impressive clip, you can bet the actual clean energy and infrastructure figures are bound to be 2-3x higher than BNEF estimates.

The outages were also making it harder to post updates to a closely watched status page, the company said. The failure affected the ability of customers to use roughly two dozen services, hitting streaming hardware maker Roku, software seller Adobe and digital photo service Flickr. \u201cKinesis has been experiencing increased error rates this morning in our US-East-1 Region that\u2019s impacted some other AWS services,\u201d a company spokeswoman said in an emailed statement. \u201cWe are working toward resolution.\u201d AWS is the largest provider of rented computing power and software services, and its data centers serve as the invisible foundation of much of the internet. That gives failures in its services an immediate visibility that rivals like Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google sometimes don\u2019t face. AWS is a collection of more than 175 software services, from data storage to a range of databases and machine-learning software. Customers often use more than one, linking them together in ways that can cause a failure in one system to cascade across multiple programs. The Seattle-based company operates those services from 24 regions, or clusters of data centers, geographic redundancy designed to station computing power close to customers while limiting the chance that a failure in any single region will result in permanent loss of data. U.S. East-1, which relies on data centers clustered in northern Virginia, is among AWS\u2019s most important regions, analysts say. Kinesis Data Streams, the service at the root of Wednesday\u2019s outage, captures and performs analytics on data, including social media feeds, dumps of public records and internal application usage logs, which can be then be fed into a variety of other software programs. Jaspreet Singh, chief executive officer of Druva Inc., a data backup and disaster recovery software maker that uses AWS services, said his engineers first noticed the outage early Wednesday morning when the flow of notifications from an AWS data monitoring service were disrupted. While the outage didn\u2019t completely sever access to a critical AWS service, it seemed to touch more products than previous outages, Singh said. \u201cTypically what tends to happen is one service goes down\u201d for a half hour or so, he said. \u201cThis is a different kind of issue.

    "article_text":"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Soccer fans are fortunate to live in a time when two superstars are simultaneously making the claim to be the best player in the history of the sport \u2014 and more fortunate still that we can watch the contest between Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo play out, week in and week out, live before a global audience of billions. Thanks to YouTube, I can watch high-quality videos of their most compelling performances, and of every goal they\u2019ve ever scored. When Diego Maradona was staking his claim to the title of best ever, most of the world could only get a quadrennial glimpse of his genius, when he turned out for Argentina in the \u201982, \u201986, \u201990 and \u201894 World Cups. Growing up in India during that period, I never saw highlights of his performances for FC Barcelona or Napoli (a city where he\u2019s still regarded as part deity, part royalty). Obituary: Maradona, Soccer Icon Who Led Argentina to Glory, Dies at 60 There are now some video highlights online that preserve a grainy record of him in his pomp \u2014 including THAT goal against England in the Azteca Stadium on June 22, 1986. But these only hint at what he was capable of. They don\u2019t constitute sufficient supporting evidence to the argument that he was the best ever. What makes it harder still is the even scarcer evidence for claimants of previous generations: Hungary\u2019s Ferenc Puskas, Spain and Argentina\u2019s Alfredo di Stefano, Brazil\u2019s Pele, the Dutchman Johan Cruyff, Germany\u2019s Franz Beckenbauer, et al. That they played under different conditions and rules, and in different positions, makes the argument moot, anyway. We can\u2019t, then, know if Maradona was technically the best to have kicked a ball. Nevertheless, I\u2019m here to argue that he was the greatest of all time. And my case rests on the simple fact that he, more than all the other claimants named here, came closest to defying the dictum that soccer is a team sport. For most of his career, Maradona played in teams that lacked any other world-beating players. Run your eye down the list of the Napoli squad with which he conquered Italian soccer in 1986-87, and there\u2019s not a single other player who would make it to a Serie A hall of fame. He had a slightly better supporting cast in the Argentina sides that he took to two World Cup finals \u2014 winning it in \u201986, and coming agonizingly close in \u201990 \u2014 but nobody would argue that Jorge Valdano was to Maradona what, say, Jairzinho was to Pele in \u201970. It is one thing to be a brilliant player surrounded by other brilliant players; in this regard Messi and Ronaldo have been exceptionally fortunate with their club teams. But Maradona made magic out of mediocre materials. What makes this even more remarkable is the weight of expectation he carried on his diminutive frame. When he signed for Napoli in 1984, the club had never won the Italian league, and yet its fans immediately began to dream of championship glory. The \u201cpibe de oro,\u201d or golden boy, was as much talisman as captain and player. Other footballers \u2014 Messi among them \u2014 have since had to cope with comparable pressure, but modern superstars are surrounded by a scaffolding of public relations professionals and psychiatrists to help them. Maradona, lacking support off the field as he did on it, nonetheless delivered the \u201coro\u201d for club and country over and over again. Until he didn\u2019t. It was probably inevitable that the burdens of his genius would eventually crush him, and they did so in spectacular fashion. But he withstood them long enough to cast in bronze \u2014 like the plaque commemorating THAT goal outside the Azteca Stadium \u2014 his claim to being the greatest of all time.

    "article_text":"That's because in the past 10 years, \u201csight tech\u201d has taken off. What we might have once called \u201cassistive\u201d or \u201cspecial needs\u201d technology has gone mainstream \u2013 and the technology developed by and for people with disabilities is now used by you, your kids, your grandparents \u2013 regardless of whether you identify as having a disability or not. Inventions to help the blind \u201csee\u201d have quietly been spurring innovation for decades. Often, idealistic inventors create with a charitable mindset \u2013 to help the needy or return something lost \u2013 but the real technological advances in sight tech have done a lot more than simply suggest a cure for human disability. They\u2019ve created new abilities for everyone, and opened new doors to unpredictable innovation: The 12-inch record, the computer keyboard, and the text recognition software that laid the foundation for the modern database were all brought to market, initially, for blind consumers. There was a time when a personal assistant, someone to read to you or a car at your door, were once thought of as \u201cspecial\u201d \u2013 but no longer. Today, every device shipped by Apple, Amazon, Google and Microsoft includes these capabilities and more, not as a bonus but as a necessity to compete in today\u2019s competitive hardware and software markets. So whether you use your phone in dark mode or talk to Siri while you\u2019re driving, you too use \u201csight tech\u201d that was invented initially for the visually impaired. Over and over again, designing for blind consumers has shown an ROI far beyond helping the needy. Audiobooks, which were heavily resisted by publishers when first developed for blind readers in 1934, now are the book industry\u2019s only growing business. Likewise, coding your website for a blind person\u2019s screen reader might seem like extra work until you realize it optimizes your SEO and makes your website more usable to about a billion other non-standard device users, as well. The world of sight tech is absolutely full of these types of happy surprises; unexpected synchronicities and wide applicability that started with designing for a seemingly small group. For most, the self-driving car is a long-promised luxury. For those of us who can\u2019t get a driver\u2019s license, it\u2019s the key to an unprecedented level of independence. Researchers at Waymo are intent on making sure that, when the first self-driving taxi arrives on your doorstep, it shouldn\u2019t matter whether you can see or not: You should be able to hop in and take a ride. Similarly, maps are much more than just a handy tool for those of us with visual impairments. In many cases, they\u2019re the only option for finding your bearings \u2013 the difference between independence and codependence. Blind and sighted inventors alike have been pushing for better, more exact navigational tools for decades, and today the team at GOOD Maps has harnessed the power of lidar, data and and faster-than-ever processors to make sure that someone with no sight can get themselves within arm's reach of exactly what they\u2019re looking for. Join product managers from Waymo, Waymap, Goodmaps and more to hear about the future of getting from point A to point B. Since the late 1980s, companies like Freedom Scientific and Humanware have laid the foundation for accessible computing, writing software and building devices that can convert visual information into sound or touch. Those devices were operating computers, rendering digital Braille and delivering audio books to readers long before there was an app for that. Today, mainstream tech giants Apple, Amazon, Microsoft and Google are creating screen readers and assistive devices of their own, not to mention the thousands of third-party apps for navigation, sensory optimization, recognizing text and images and more. And with this new functionality native to operating systems, established assistive tech companies are evolving, too. We\u2019ll take a deep dive into what\u2019s next for the \u201cscreen reader\u201d \u2013 and how new tech from AI to AR, and headgear to haptics are shaking up interfaces and reshaping paradigms across our industry. Over the course of two days, we\u2019ll be hearing from the accessibility leaders at Apple, Microsoft, Google, Vispero, Humanware, Amazon and more. Even the greatest new tech creates great new problems. And as AI swoops in to save the day, allowing blind and visually impaired people to overcome barriers in their work and social lives, AI can also introduce new biases that we never expected. When training our systems to recognize, categorize and interact with real people, how do we account for disability and a diverse range of functional needs? How do we make machines that don\u2019t inherit our own cultural prejudices? We\u2019ll also be joined by some of the blindness and disability community\u2019s greatest advocates: people like Lainey Feingold, Haben Girma and George Kerscher, who will take a hard look at access to information as a civil right, how far we\u2019ve come and how far we have to go in the era of AI. \u00a0 \u00a0"

    "article_text":"Considering the COVID-19 pandemic is still wreaking havoc on the financial statements of Corporate America, Lores\u2019 position at HP is not a bad one to be in right now even if things aren\u2019t 100% perfect at the computing giant. \u201cI think we are showing good performance across many businesses of the company. And clearly the pandemic has reinforced the businesses that we have on the consumer side and help us in that direction,\u201d Lores told Yahoo Finance Live in the wake of a 10 cent fourth fiscal quarter earnings beat Tuesday evening. \u201cAt the same time, we continue to make progress executing all of our strategies, whether it is to advance the leadership that we have in PCs and print to create new categories, but also to transform the company and become more efficient,\u201d said Lores. \u201cSo we will look at the impact that all of those things are having as what is behind the success and the progress we are making, as reflected in our results.\u201d Here are HP\u2019s fourth fiscal quarter results, compared to Bloomberg estimates: Total Revenue: $15.3 billion (sales fell 1% from same time a year ago) vs. $14.69 billion Non-GAAP EPS: 62 cents vs. 52 cents First Fiscal Quarter EPS Guidance: 64 cents a share to 70 cents vs. 54 cents Sales at HP\u2019s personal systems and printing segments were unchanged and fell 3%, respectively, from the prior year. Sales growth was notched inside the consumer segments of each division, reflecting consumers buying notebook computers and printers to work from home. Commercial sales dropped as workers have migrated from offices where large printers and desktops reign supreme \u2014 hence less desire by businesses to buy new hardware. Operating profits at HP\u2019s personal systems segment fell slightly on a sequential basis, but rose 260 basis points at the printer business. Lores told Yahoo Finance the printer business bottomed in the third fiscal quarter. The Street very often has a lot to weigh on HP. The company isn\u2019t exactly a high growth tech juggernaut like any one of the FAANG stocks. But, Lores continues to gain high marks on the Street for his management of the business during the pandemic \u2014 which includes a very watchful eye on expenses and a push to innovate in both the printer and computing sides of the businesses. HP has frankly just done good amidst the pandemic to build goodwill among households, moving quickly to support the computing needs of students. And now with expense tailwinds at his back supporting margins, Lores looks ready to become even more aggressive on the cash deployment front to drive a higher stock price. \u201cIf I look at what we did in the third quarter and fourth quarter combined, we bought back close to 10% of the outstanding shares of the company. I would say this is a fairly remarkable number,\u201d Lores told Yahoo Finance. \u201cAnd we have also announced that going forward, we are going to buy at least $1 billion of shares per quarter. And we also have announced that we are going to be increasing our dividend by 10% in 2021. So we remain fully committed to returning capital to shareholders. We have done that during the last two quarters, and we will continue to do that in the coming quarters.\u201d Again, not a bad position to be in for Lores and his shareholders.

    "article_text":"Returns as of 11\/28\/2020 Returns as of 11\/28\/2020 Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. November has seen an abundance of well-known tech companies like Affirm, Airbnb, and DoorDash file to go public. However, the IPO investors should be most excited about is Roblox. The gaming platform for individual creators has a long runway for growth and looks similar to YouTube a decade ago. Here's what investors need to know about the company. Image source: Getty Images. Roblox has a similar strategy, except with gaming instead of video. It describes itself as a \"global platform where millions of people gather together every day to imagine, create, and share experiences with each other in immersive, user-generated 3D worlds.\" In layman's terms, Roblox users build games that other Roblox users can play. The company makes money by selling its virtual currency called \"Robux\" to users. Users can then spend Robux on experiences and features built by the developer community, which then can be exchanged for real-world currency. It also offers Roblox Premium, a subscription service where users can get Robux at a discount to the company's internal exchange rate.  Through the first nine months of 2020, Roblox posted $589 million in sales and a $206 million net loss. However, that loss is a bit misleading. Net bookings, defined as sales before any non-cash adjustments, were $1.24 billion in the same period, up 171% from 2019. Why such a large discrepancy between bookings and sales? Because when Roblox sells users Robux, it can't recognize that as revenue until the users spend those Robux on something. This makes it seem like the company is losing a ton of money, when in fact it has generated $292.6 million in free cash flow so far this year.  Roblox is currently focused on building a platform for kids. Some 54% of its 31.1 million daily active users (DAUs) over the last nine months were under the age of 13. This may concern investors, because young kids are usually not high-paying users. However, Roblox's 17-24 age group, while only 16% of overall users, is growing faster than its core under-13 demographic. Eventually, Roblox wants to enable content development for older age groups, stating in its S-1 that it is working to host experiences for gamers of all types.  Another concern among investors is that Roblox is getting a temporary \"COVID bump\" that is not indicative of its long-term growth. While it is true the pandemic accelerated bookings growth to 171% in 2020, the company was still growing at a healthy 39% rate in 2019. Even if growth reverts back to mid-double-digits in 2021 or 2022, that seems like nothing any potential shareholder would need to worry about.  Investors should expect bookings growth to remain strong, given the size and growth of the overall gaming industry. Estimates peg the market size at around $150 billion and on pace to grow around 12%-13% over the next decade. Given this long runway and the fact Roblox is already cash-flow positive, investors should keep a keen eye on this company as it nears the public markets. Stock Advisor launched in February of 2002.

    "url":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/video\/colin-kaepernick-not-play-nfl-133901017.html",
    "article_text":"In this episode of Influencers, Andy Serwer speaks with former NFL player and 'Uncomfortable Conversations with a Black Man' author, Emmanuel Acho, about Colin Kaepernick's future in football and what NFL owners can do to address racial tension within the league. ANDY SERWER: When you had Roger Goodell on, Emmanuel-- I think it was in August-- he offered an apology to Colin Kaepernick. But Colin Kaepernick still has not been signed by a team. Is this collusion? Do you think he'll ever go back to the NFL? EMMANUEL ACHO: No, I don't think Colin Kaepernick will play in the NFL, but there are so many variables to this. What do I mean by that? In the NFL, every organization runs a cost-benefit analysis. How much will it cost us to have you on organization, and how much will you benefit us? So if you're an NFL organization, especially four years removed, in regards to Colin Kaepernick, now you're weighing the risk-reward. He'll come in, and obviously, he'll be anywhere from a second- to a third-string quarterback right now. Is having Colin Kaepernick as a second- or third-string quarterback worth the questions that every player will now get asked, that we will now get asked, and is it worth the distraction that the media will create? Not Colin Kaepernick, necessarily, but the media will create. So, because of that, I don't think that Colin Kaepernick would get signed. I also think that-- I don't know-- sometimes there's an impasse. Remember. Let's talk Cam Newton for a second. Cam Newton didn't want to be a backup quarterback. He wanted to be a starter. And as a result, there was only one team that wanted to make him a starter. Eric Reid, someone who has been proudly known to be standing by Colin Kaepernick, very justifiably so-- the Washington Football Team-- they offered him a place on their practice squad. Eric Reid turned it down because Eric Reid views himself as a starter. And so, just because you want to play doesn't necessarily mean that the position will be offered to you that you do, in fact, want. So, because of all the nuances regarding that, I personally don't see Colin Kaepernick playing in the NFL. - So it was the situation where the owners didn't want him for a while, and now Father Time has entered into the equation as well a little bit, perhaps, too. EMMANUEL ACHO: I would say it's a combination of everything. The owners don't want what the media will bring with that, number one. And number two-- it's so detailed, and it's so multifaceted, but until the owners can also get their fans to understand it wasn't about disrespecting the flag-- it was about a just cause-- then the owners, who were always worried about bottom line, who were always worried about their dollars, now are gonna run the risk of losing their dollars for the sake of Colin Kaepernick. And unfortunately, owners just aren't that selfless. You don't become a billionaire by being selfless. That's not how it works. - And as you were saying, too, Emmanuel-- different cities, different owners, different politics. It's all part of that equation, as you said. You mentioned the 32 owners. Only two of them are people of color, and only three non-interim head coaches are black. Wow. Seems like there's a long way to go there, too, right? EMMANUEL ACHO: Yeah, but the issue, Andy, is that so many people think the NFL is a meritocracy. However hard you work, you'll earn your success. It's not. It's really based off nepotism and cronyism. Nepotism, you hire your family, and cronyism, you hire your friends. Historically, if the NFL was founded by white men, white men are hiring their family-- nepotism-- white men. They're hiring their friends-- cronyism-- white men. So how do you think that the NFL will change if it's historically founded by white men who are looking out for other white men? It won't. And so, that's why it's not a coincidence when you see only 3 out of 32 coaches, full-time, who began the season, or whatever the statistic may be, are black. That's not a coincidence. That's just the way in which our world at large works, and the NFL is a reflection of that."

    "article_text":"  The French government has sent notices to multinational internet companies that they should pay the country\u2019s digital tax in December, a finance ministry spokesman said on Wednesday. The government canceled a few weeks ago its earlier decision to suspend the collection of the controversial levy. The outlook: The Trump administration may now choose to go ahead with the tariffs in its last two months in power, but whatever it decides or not, the situation will have to be dealt with by incoming president Joe Biden and his team.  The clear hope of European governments is that the U.S. will rejoin the OECD talks, so that an international agreement on global tax can be struck next year. This should not be too difficult: Even the companies targeted by the measure have indicated their preference for a global tax, which would spare them the compliance costs of having to deal with many different national ones.  The OECD talks had made serious progress on the technical level and were seen to be nearing a positive conclusion. With the coronavirus recession and governments strapped for cash, tax avoidance on the level used by big multinationals has become politically indefensible. A deal shouldn\u2019t be too hard to find next year, making the current Franco-American skirmish obsolete."

    "url":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/south-korea-unveils-ai-chip-063000516.html",
    "article_text":"(Bloomberg) -- South Korea is adding a new artificial intelligence chip to its arsenal of semiconductors as the nation seeks a bigger slice of the global tech market and an upgrade of its industrial capabilities. The Sapeon X220, unveiled Wednesday by the largest local carrier SK Telecom Co., is designed to speed up servers that cater to a growing number of mobile devices -- from drones to self-driving vehicles -- that perform better with AI. It\u2019s the latest product of the nation\u2019s decade-long push to broaden its dominance beyond memory chips, where Samsung Electronics Co. and SK Hynix Inc. control roughly two-thirds of the global market. South Korea sees data-processing chips as a major engine for future economic growth, along with fifth-generation wireless networks. The government has provided more than 600 billion won ($542 million) in support to develop such chips and plans to invest another trillion won over the next decade, viewing them as crucial in automating factories and improving the competitiveness of the country\u2019s exports. \u201cAs we teamed up with the government, we said, \u2018Let\u2019s make AI available and affordable for all of our companies,\u2019\u201d said Lee Jong-min, an SK Telecom vice president overseeing the chip development. \u201cSouth Korea has the demand, the full stack of tech needed to meet the demand, and the ability to take it to the next level.\u201d Semiconductors account for about one-fifth of South Korea\u2019s exports, most of them memory chips. The country is now turning to application-specific integrated circuits, or ASICs, such as the X220, which is tailored for AI operations. It follows a similar $1 billion investment plan announced by the U.S. government this summer, which also emphasized AI and public-private collaboration. As the first country in the world to roll out commercial 5G last year, South Korea believes it also can lead in adopting and optimizing AI by virtue of the nation\u2019s compact size, wide broadband coverage and smartphone penetration. Competition is heating up in the AI semiconductor space, with the likes of Amazon.com Inc. and Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google investing in their own bespoke server silicon. As more devices than ever come online, companies are betting they can unlock value and insights from the resulting trove of data through machine learning and analysis at scale. Like SK Telecom, U.S. competitors offer such cloud services to other companies, and the investment in designing the chips makes sense when factoring in the cost of electricity and the chips\u2019 ability to handle greater volumes of data more efficiently. Read more: Chip Industry Sees Danger of AI in Explosion of Electricity Use SK Telecom\u2019s chip, the size of a postage stamp, is the first Korean ASIC for data centers to be commercialized, according to the company. It represents the latest push by the Seoul-based carrier to expand beyond its traditional mobile and broadband businesses and keep up in an era of AI-driven innovation. The global AI chip market is currently led by Nvidia Corp., a graphics-card giant whose market value has eclipsed that of Intel Corp., the company historically most associated with semiconductor breakthroughs. Demand for Nvidia\u2019s GPUs has spiked in recent years, as the perennially increasing demands of high-resolution video games have been joined by a boom in cryptocurrency mining and other data-intensive applications that benefit from massively parallel processing. Even smartphone processors from the likes of Apple Inc. and Huawei Technologies Co. now come with dedicated cores for handling AI tasks, and the need for more ASICs like the Sapeon X220 is forecast to rise as artificial intelligence gains more ground in global technology. \u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P."

Lewis: Yeah, you know, Jason, we do S-1 shows all the time and I think they're fun in general, because it's a first look at a business, we really get to dive into everything that they're disclosing, and that's fantastic. But it's particularly fun for a company that we know so well; and in my case, I've used plenty. So, I think, probably most of our audience is going to be familiar with Airbnb, but we should do a quick little rundown on who they are and what they do. For folks that are unfamiliar, it is an online vacation rental marketplace. And folks who have a property can make it available for short-term rentals. Typically, short-term rental nature, usually weekend trips or multi-week vacations. They can be used for longer trips as well, though it's a bit less common. And some quick history on the business, it was founded in 2008 by roommates and former classmates Brian Chesky and Joe Gebbia. And it started out as AirBedandBreakfast.com. It was their answer to the absurd accommodation shortage in San Francisco. Fun fact, Jason, if you go to AirBedandBreakfast.com, it takes you to Airbnb, they still have that URL. Hall: Of course it does, it makes sense. Absolutely, it makes sense. And here's the funny thing about, I think it's interesting, because it was an airbed. They were literally renting out airbeds and their apartment for people that were coming for a conference. I think they rented airbeds to three or four different people in their little two-bedroom apartment in the Bay Area. And now what the business has become today is like the law of unintended consequences, right? This is not a business of [laughs] people renting out airbeds in their living room and in their dining room, this is a completely different business model. Lewis: This reminds me a little bit of the \"necessity is the mother of invention\" quote, where, [laughs] you know, this is perhaps a problem that is very unique to very specific markets, and San Francisco, obviously, being one of them, where people are willing to accept very barebones accommodations because things are so expensive there, it's in so high demand. [laughs] They've grown far beyond their origins here, but I think that they tapped into something and then realized very quickly that there's probably a more refined version of this that scales really well. And as it turns out, it is a pretty viable business. I am a customer, and I think the value prop here is one that you recognize as well, Jason. Hall: Oh, no doubt about it. I'm also a customer. As a matter of fact, I'm married and we have a young child, and we almost exclusively use Airbnb for leisure travel, just because it's easier, right? It's nice to have some privacy when you have a young kid, because with a hotel, you don't know who's going to be next to you and how late they're going to be up and how much noise they are going to be making, even if they're watching the TV, you can hear. It's nice to have the kitchen there to throw some cereal in a bowl for the kid, that sort of thing. And actually, we started using Airbnb years and years ago, before having kids. We have some close friends that -- I'm in Southern California now -- we have some close friends that we met here, they actually ended up moving to the D.C. area. And within a year or so of their moving, we decided we would start planning a trip every year together. And we always travel around the July 4th weekend, the July 4th holiday. And we go for a week. And we started doing international travel. We went to Peru. We went to Iceland, and we've done a few other things too, and we always did Airbnb, every single time. And it just worked out incredible. Lewis: Yeah, I think just to use my hometown and, kind of, The Fool's hometown of D.C., as an example for why it's so compelling as a customer. You look at a map of D.C., and most of the stuff is downtown. You know, you have the museums, you have the archives, you have access to the mall and, obviously, the White House and all these things. And that's where all the hotels are. Unfortunately, you have the restaurants that are down there, you have some parks down there, but it's not a very vibrant late-night scene. And I know personally, you know when I travel, I like to be somewhere that feels a little bit more like where I'd live if I was in that city, and just be able to kind of explore it in what feels like a little bit more of an organic way. And so, for D.C. that tends to be Mount Pleasant, Columbia Heights, and those types of neighborhoods where I live. And so, there aren't really a lot of hotels around there. If that's the vibe [laughs] you're going for, you need an Airbnb. And I think that they managed to scratch that itch really well. I think what they also offer a lot of people is just flexibility on how they're traveling, to your point, about having a kid with you and just being able to easily throw meals together, and have a full kitchen where you're staying. You know, I know people that do family reunions and they get a big Airbnb, they do a barbecue, they have a big yard, all those kinds of stuff. I think it just gives you a little bit more wiggle room with a lot of the things that you might want with travel but often have to sacrifice. And I mean, that's really valuable to people, and on the flipside, if you're a property owner or you have a lease that allows you to do it, to be able to say, yeah, I'm not going to be here for two months, I'm traveling for work. You know, it's nice for people who have properties to be able to make some extra money. It's kind of a nice little win-win. It has created [laughs] a little bit of a side market where people are intentionally buying places and then basically exclusively using them as Airbnbs, which creates some housing supply issues and some regulatory issues that we might touch on later. But I think, by and large, when this is used the right way, it's a really wonderful solution for a lot of people. Hall: Yeah, it is, and we'll touch on a little bit more, but it's created an entire cottage industry, really, of companies, businesses that exclusively buy properties in all kinds of different areas, and that's all they do, is operate these Airbnbs. Lewis: Yeah. And I think in a perfect world, you know, I like to stay in someone's house, but at the same time, it's nice to stay at a location where, you know, if my friends are going to be nearby, we can easily be half-a-block away, not have to worry quite so much about finding hotels and all of that stuff. Clearly, Jason, you and I are not alone in thinking that [laughs] this is a good concept. And you know, you don't get a start with a B. unicorn valuation without getting a couple fans along the way. This company, prior to early 2020, was growing like crazy. You look at their results for the full-year for 2019, some of the key metrics that they look at their gross booking value, kind of, similar to what we look at for a lot of these payments companies, you know, with what they process, up 29% year-over-year to $38 billion; that is a very big number. Hall: Yeah, that's enormous, right? And obviously, what they get is a smaller percentage of that, but that's the amount of money that people are willing to go to their platform and spend, [laughs] and that's telling. And just, I think, for some context here, Marriott International did about $14 billion in revenue last year. So, again, revenue doesn't exactly translate to this, but Marriott is a big hotel operator, so they collect the vast majority of those revenues that come in as bookings, so context. This is a great, big business. Lewis: It is. And I think their full-year revenue for 2018 was about $4.8 billion, which actually puts [laughs] them ahead of Hilton in annual revenue, which is hard to believe because this is a company that is still pretty early on in its growth stage. But it has a concept that works, and I think it's created such a market around it that it's been able to enjoy a lot of growth along the way, because the rest of that market is just trying to catch up. There are competitors, however, I think that they operate in, kind of, a slightly different space than the hotels. They're catering to different customers. So, really, a lot of their main competition is going to be people in this rental market, this kind of more specified house rental market and vacation rental market, like the VRBOs [Vacation Rentals by Owner] of the world. Hall: Right. Lewis: Putting some more numbers to the business. That $4.8 billion in revenue basically tracks year-over-year in terms of growth with that annual gross booking value. There are going to be some slight puts-and-takes there, but by and large those numbers are going to trend together. So, up 30% year-over-year. Operating loss of about $500 million on that. Total loss of $674 million. And we're focusing, [laughs] Jason, on the 2019 full-year numbers, because I think, in some ways, the company kind of gets a Mulligan in 2020. You know, they were thrown such a [laughs] difficult and, really, business model-bending series of events, as a lot of companies were in 2020, that it's kind of hard to get a really good sense of what's going on with this business if you're looking at anything from the past six months. Hall: Yeah, I agree. But in some ways, I think it's obviously still going to be worth taking a look at the numbers, because I think in some ways, Airbnb may have been more resilient than more traditional, again, we're going to comp it to hotels in a lot of ways, because that's kind of the obvious comp, and it's clearly taking business from that market, but I think in ways it's been more resilient than a lot of hotels. Lewis: Yeah. So, I know some listeners are going to be there being like, why are you talking 2019? We'll get to 2020 too, we'll talk about it, but I think just to kind of give you -- Hall: It's a better baseline. Lewis: It is. It gives you a better sense of, like, when things are generally going OK, you know, what are we seeing here? And I mentioned that loss, just kind of a sense of where the money is going, the cost of revenue about $1.1 billion, which means that if you put some quick math to it, the gross margins for this company are about 75%, which is darn high and [laughs] can create a very compelling investment opportunity very quickly. However, those margins are getting eaten up, because they are spending heavily in operations, product development, and general administration. All of that together winds up being somewhere in, like, the $2 billion-something range. But really, Jason, the biggie here is sales and marketing, that's $1.6 billion on its own. I'm guessing that's not going anywhere anytime soon. Hall: I would expect not. Again, the bottom-line is, with a business like this, you want to see them spending on these sorts of things, because they're establishing dominance, they're building a market presence, so that the network effect of their scale is attractive to all the stakeholders. And at some point, what you just want to see is that the cash flows, the acceleration of cash flows, becomes bigger than the acceleration of spending on this, that's kind of the strategic thing that you want to be looking at. But, no, it's going to get bigger. Lewis: Yeah. And it's early innings in the space that they're into, I think that this is very much a market that's in landgrab mode, and so for them, to be the first choice for customers who still haven't come online to doing vacation rentals and are maybe still hotel-stayers, to be able to say, like, we're the one for you, ignore Vrbo, [laughs] you know, ignore some of those competitors out there, because that's valuable customer acquisition. And if you can become the definitive, the default for them, that's going to pay off long-term. We should talk a little bit about what we've seen so far, and I said it before, but COVID-19 really threw the numbers for this business out of whack. We look at the first nine months ended September 30th, 2020, Jason, revenue was $2.5 billion, down from $3.7 billion in the same period a year ago. That is a pretty significant haircut. Hall: It is. And I mean, the bottom-line is that, that's what happens when you lose basically two months entirely, just you know, if you look it's interesting, you start looking at some of the data in the S-1 where they talk about their bookings and you see negative numbers, because they had so many bookings that they had more cancellations than bookings they got in that same period. I mean, [laughs] the meter literally ran backwards for 2.5 months. Lewis: Yeah. And it's nice to see that they were able to survive it. They did have to make some pretty dramatic changes, and they wound up having to trim costs pretty dramatically. So, I think they laid off about 25% of the global workforce. They weren't producing salaries that executives were receiving. The sales and marketing budget took a dip; I imagine, as things return, that that's going to go right back up. But they also issued some debt financing to make sure that they were in a relatively good position from an operating standpoint, which thankfully, they were in a position to do. You see a much higher debt burden on the books for them now than you might have back in 2019; and I think it's because they wanted to make sure that they had access to cash. Hall: That's, I guess, one of the reasons that they're really looking to try to do an IPO relatively soon, as they want to make sure that their balance sheet is as bolstered as possible. Because again, as much as the spending on sales and marketing is happening, when you have to cut 25% of your workforce and you are a tech company, and you're building out an infrastructure, that makes it harder to grow. Now, it's going to be even harder to replace the staff that you lost, right? So, it's really important that they make sure they have as much capital accessible as possible. And my understanding is that the debt that they took on, I think, all of it is convertible. So, I think at some point that that debt is most likely going to get turned into shares down the road. So, it's one of the things investors need to be aware of. As we start getting more pricing and that sort of thing, as we get closer to an IPO, what is the impact of that debt on the future -- what's the word I'm looking for here? Lewis: Shareholders? [laughs] I mean, really, like, it's a dilution thing, right? Hall: \"Dilution,\" that's the word, yeah, exactly. So, you have to be aware of it, right? Lewis: Yeah. And then so, I mean, if you look at the books and you can, kind of, look at this debt a little bit differently, depending on how you're playing out the first 12 months or so of them being a public a trading company, but my count in the S-1, $3 billion in cash and long-term debt of about $1.8 billion; a hefty amount of convertible notes in there, TBD on how that actually turns out. But even at that point, Jason, that's a net cash position, they're going to be in a spot where they can pretty comfortably weather some uncertainty for a while. And I think what's kind of interesting is to look at some of the commentary that we've seen from management about how COVID has affected usage on their platform. One of the things that really stuck out to me was, they have seen bookings within 200 miles of users go from about a third to half of their overall bookings. And what they're seeing more and more of is people [laughs] just getting out for short periods of time, you know, and maybe not even going very far, but just kind of needing a change of scenery. Hall: Well, anecdotally, I can tell you we've done that twice, and we'll do it one more time before the end of the year. We have a couple of family groups that are kind of part of our cluster, I guess, you could describe it. Our kids are in day care together, so we really have exactly the same risk profiles already. And we rented a house, a gigantic huge place that had a full playground, and a big pool and all this stuff. And I think it cost each family a couple of hundred bucks a night and we did it for a four-day weekend back in, like, May. And it was just a great way to get away, and look at different walls, right, and let the kids get out and stretch out, play. And then we did a little trip to the mountains, a couple of -- maybe two months ago. It was a smaller thing and it was just our family, but same thing, you know, these were all driving distance away. And we plan to do something for New Years as well, just our family. So, yeah, I think, it's like we've seen with a lot of other parts of the economy, where people that are still earning money and still working have a lot more disposable income right now that they're not using to go out to eat every Friday night with friends, they're not taking that big family vacation to Hawaii or the Bahamas or whatever. So, there's that extra disposable income, and right now Airbnb is in a great position to be a beneficiary from that. Lewis: Yeah, and that's kind of an interesting take on a trend that they were already benefiting from, because, you know, you rewind the clock to February of 2020, and the narrative, for the most part when it came to consumer spending is that people are spending more on experiences, were moving a little bit away from spending on things. And I think Airbnb, in particular, because they offer remote locations, exotic locales, interesting spaces, also really benefits from this kind of social media-fication of everything. And you know, it's much more fun, I think, to be in a spot that is kind of Instagram-able, whether that's your MO or not, than to be in a hotel. And for them, to be able to offer unique experiences that feel a little bit more curated, feel more local, you know, craft is such a big part of what we're going for these days, they're already benefiting from that. And then you put people who are still making money in a position where, frankly, a lot of those purchases otherwise aren't really happening. You aren't really going out to eat nearly as much, you're probably not buying as much because you're very keenly aware, if you're like me, of all the stuff you already have in your house and you're trying to work through that rather than clutter things up. So, I think they're fairly well-positioned, given what a massive shock this was to their business. Hall: Yeah, there's no doubt about that. And again, I think it's one of those things where, you know, you think about, like, the Lowe's and Home Depots of the world, that have gotten this big benefit of people doing home improvement projects and things that could have near-term implications, for maybe their business won't be as great when we do go back to normal, I don't think that's the same for Airbnb, I think maybe to the contrary maybe more like e-commerce, where a lot of people have used e-commerce that weren't planning to ever user e-commerce, and they're going to keep using e-commerce. I think, maybe Airbnb might be the same thing, people that, still, they were loyal to Hilton, because they got their Hilton Rewards, right? Maybe they decided, I don't feel comfortable in a hotel, but we need a weekend getaway, so we're going to go and we're going to rent a house somewhere, and they did it through Airbnb, and they had a great experience. And so, now [laughs] they're Airbnb customers. So, I think that that's what we're going to see, is that it's just -- because again, this is such a young industry, it's not mature, and they're still in that landgrab phase. Yeah, I think it's a really, really interesting time right now. Lewis: Yeah, I think that the timing of this is really interesting with where this industry is, Jason. Because Airbnb, in a lot of ways, had a pretty big lead here. And there's Vrbo, and we can talk about them a little bit, but they're owned by HomeAway, which is then bought by Expedia. So, if you're interested, there's a publicly investable player in the space already, but you know ... Hall: But it's not a pureplay, right? [laughs] And there's plenty of other problems worse we could talk about with the Expedia business. I can say this, just real quickly on it, I was originally pretty loyal to Vrbo when Airbnb was really just kind of getting a little bit of a critical mass, just because Vrbo was the one that was there. And they were started in Europe, a little bigger in Europe, and became a little more available in the States, mainly because there were a couple of areas that we were doing family gatherings and we needed a big space, and there were things on Vrbo. But within a year, I just stopped even looking at [laughs] Vrbo and just shifted to Airbnb, because of availability everywhere, and it just became easier. Lewis: Yeah, I think that's right, and they benefit a little bit from that Kleenex effect or the Google effect, I've seen it called too. Where it's like, when you think of this category, you don't think of Vrbo, you think of Airbnb. And they've really been able to cement themselves as the consumer brand in this space. What I'm curious about with the timing of this is, you know, they're like, I said before, still kind of in landgrab mode, there are a lot of people that aren't using these, still using hotels and are customers to be won, so to speak. You know, does this put them in a spot where they lose a little bit of that first-mover edge because the industry has been halted, and it gives some of the other players a little time to catch up? Hall: You know, I don't know if that's going to be the case, just because the playing field is pretty leveled right now in that regard, everybody is affected similarly. And I think simply the fact that they do have such a -- not a first-mover, but a most-mover advantage, because they're the pureplay and this is where all the resources are focused right now. And if you think about other companies that are trying to get into it, a lot of them are doing it defensively, because [laughs] they're trying to protect their entrenched interests in the short-term stay, which -- I mean, that's the big market, right, the long-term addressable market is pretty small, this is the short-term market really where this is focused. I really think that they still come out of this as, if not the winner, I think they are probably going to be \"the\" winner, they're certainly \"a\" winner, because they have the resources, they have that, like you said, the Kleenex effect, it's not just the name that people looking for a place think of, it's the name that people that are thinking about it as a source of income and they own a property or thinking about investing a property, it's the name that comes to mind for them as well. Lewis: Yeah. And I think that this is probably a winner take a good chunk market, [laughs] but I think there are probably a couple of winners here. And one of the main reasons is, you know, this is definitely an industry that benefits from network effects, but there isn't any exclusivity to those network effects, which is kind of hard. And so, for the likes of Airbnb, like, you can list on there, but then you can also list on Vrbo. And so, yes, those platforms benefit from there being more consumers and more property owners, but there's nothing to keep people from operating in both spaces. And in that sense, it does feel a little bit like Uber and Lyft and some of the rideshare market dynamics, where, yes, you've built out this wonderful network, but now [laughs] we're in a spot where other people can also benefit from this wonderful network that you've created. Hall: Yeah, I think so. I think maybe another way to think about it is, like, Visa and MasterCard. You have Visa that is much larger, if you think about it, in the consumer space, for consumer spending than MasterCard, but you have two companies that have done extremely well. And, yeah, there's more friction, you have to go to the bank and get one or get the other, actually just go online, [laughs] you don't actually have to go to the bank anymore, but at some point you end up with a Visa and a MasterCard both in your wallet. And to a certain extent, the one that you use is just the one that you use. I mean, there may have been a reason that you started out that way, but at some point, it just becomes, [laughs] that's where the momentum is. And I think that's most likely what we're going to see. And we could see, like, some incentive wars at some point, and that's what -- like, I use my Costco Visa a lot, because I get a lot of rewards there. But then when I shop at Amazon, I use my Amazon Visa, because I get rewards there. So, at some point, we could see something like that happen, right, where there's loyalty programs and that sort of thing that kind of drive the market, but I think at this point there's just such, they have such a head start and there's so much mindshare with the brand that it's going to be tough for anybody to really meaningfully catch up, because again, nobody else is really pure playing this in the same way that Airbnb is. Lewis: One of the other, kind of, main topics that I think we need to hit as we're kind of running through some of the existential questions facing this business is, you know, how does the regulatory picture come together in this space? You know, this is a gig economy company in a lot of ways but it faces a very different set of regulatory risks than the likes of Uber and Lyft. You know, it's not a labor-based thing that's going to dramatically affect their costs, it's like a local municipality thing, and it's much more regionalized. Hall: And it costs the company more money to figure it out. You go on Airbnb's website and you look at Ventura County, which is where I live, just outside of L.A., we actually border L.A. County, you won't find an Airbnb. They can't do them here; our local regulations don't allow for it. You know, that's a perfect example. And, I mean, California alone has dozens of counties, and within those dozens of counties you have a couple of thousand municipalities that can individually have different laws. And I think one of the things that you've seen, and this is interesting, that I learned earlier this year when we booked a place, the place we booked was in Fullerton, California, which is kind of down near -- sort of, close to Disneyland, in that area. And when that individual property owner, they marketed that space as a great place for, like, a big family reunion that's also close to theme parks, [laughs] obviously, Disneyland is not getting a lot of traffic, so they kind of rebranded how they were doing it, but what I found was that the City of Fullerton actually had no way to regulate that industry, there was not a single written piece of city code for them to be able to use to regulate it. So, they literally couldn't do anything about it. Their City Council was going to be meeting the week after our stay, and it was the No. 1 thing [laughs] on their agenda to identify. So, it's been that wild west, right, because a lot of places haven't regulated it, because there was no reason to. But that's changing. So, that is a big risk factor that's industrywide. Lewis: Yeah. And I think it winds up showing up in a bunch of different ways. I've seen some municipalities put rules on who can offer Airbnbs and they're only allowing it if it's owner-occupied and it's part of the home, or it's a unit within a home that's owner-occupied. And a really big part of that is the fact that -- we were talking about it before, there are these cottage industry businesses that have bought up a bunch of spaces or have entered long-term leases and operate them as Airbnbs, and while that's really great for travelers, if you live in that city what it does is it artificially raises the price of property and puts people that may already be price-squeezed out of neighborhoods, even more so in that position. And so, I think it's a really challenging thing, because we have all these local municipalities, all these jurisdictions, that are handling it slightly differently. And the net effect is, it might be that less properties are available on Airbnb. Hall: I may be one of the most hypocritical people on the planet when it comes to it. You know, I describe myself as exclusive Airbnb user for leisure travel, yet I also recognize there is this enormous -- you know, I'm a little older than you, Dylan, but I think for people your age and a little bit younger that are really looking to try to get into houses, millennials, like this is the time that millennials are buying houses. And affordable housing is a generational problem, there is not enough affordable housing, and it's compounded as these things tend to work out, in some of Airbnbs most interesting, compelling markets. Think about places like Austin, you think about the Bay Area, housing is already incredibly expensive there, those are also the places that you see this cottage industry having formed, of these businesses that buy a bunch of condos in the nicest areas and in the most appealing areas. And so, they immediately soak up more of that residential supply that's already in high demand, and they're exclusively for these short-term Airbnb rentals. So, it's really interesting how this is going to play out; we'll see what happens, but it's interesting. Lewis: Yeah. And if you're thinking about the risk that all of these individual markets pose to Airbnb as a business, it is worth looking at the revenue diversification. Because they do say that, you know, they operate in, like, 100,000 cities, none of those cities are responsible for more than 2.5% of their revenue, so they are spread out wide. I think that the danger for them comes more in someone finding something that's very restrictive and seeing that it works exactly the way that they're planning on having it work, and then other [laughs] cities just saying, well, that looks pretty good, I think we're going to use that same policy. My hunch is that won't happen anytime soon, because the lag on seeing the effects of policy alone will take a while. And really, you know, what we're seeing here with most of the stuff is, we have an innovative idea, we see people use it in this really great way, we see a marketplace emerge that kind of changes the way that everyone thought the rules of engagement worked, and now we need to kind of step in and start putting some rules down. And there's always going to be a bit of a timeline there, there's always going to be some time between the idea happening and us figuring out exactly what the best execution of this thing is for all parties. Hall: Yeah, that's the key. And it is good that they're so diversified. And to your point, I don't think it's likely that a lot of municipalities are going to go backwards, where they've already become entrenched. It's really, really hard to go the other way once those things get established. There is one other risk factor I wanted to point out that I read that it's just worth knowing about. The company is calling out a tax liability risk that could cost the company more than $1 billion in taxes going back to 2013, that could be -- it's still working through the details on that right now, but it could have to cough up more than a $1 billion in its liquidity to cover past tax expenses. So, that's substantial, so that's one of those things you got to kind of be thinking about. Lewis: Yeah, particularly for a business of this size. I mean, I think even with an IPO, what we're talking about in terms of capital being raised here, is in the low single-digit billions. So, talking about that net cash position before, they're going to get some more, but that would be a significant hit to their net cash position. And they're not like, you know, a Facebook or Google [Alphabet] that could take a fine and [laughs] then cover it basically with a quarter's profits, this would be a sizable thing for them to have to deal with. Hall: Yeah, it could be, and another thing that's worth understanding too, is that a lot of their cash, because they've grown so much overseas, almost $1.5 billion of their cash is overseas. So, any domestic expenses that their domestic capital doesn't cover, they would have to repatriate that money and there's more tax implications that come along with that. So, there's complexity, kind of, in their overall financial situation and nuance that's worth at least understanding. Lewis: Jason, we obviously don't know valuation yet, and we won't until shares are available and we see something priced, but how do you look at this business? I mean, is this something that you're watching that is going on the watchlist that you are eager to buy shares of, like, totally ignoring, how are you feeling about it? Hall: You know, I am really, really interested. Again, personally I use the business and I love it. And if there's a business that I use and love and that is growing at a very high rate and is proven to be very disruptive, it's very interesting; it is very, very interesting. The reality of those that, you know, even a great investment is a dumb investment at the wrong price, so that's the thing that I'm watching most closely. I can tell you this, I can tell you somebody that is very interested in this IPO that I've been hearing about constantly for six months, that's our colleague Nick Sciple. Like, I think he might go all-in on Airbnb. Lewis: You know, I love that, because, for folks that don't know Nick well, I think Nick defaults to skepticism. Hall: He does. Lewis: And so, when Nick gets excited about something, I immediately pay attention. Hall: Turns on the lights, really does. Yup. Lewis: [laughs] Yeah. I think for me, Jason, what's really appealing about this is its marketplace. We saw that high gross margin figure. And so, at scale, and bringing some of those expenses down, this could be a very profitable business at some point. There's a lot to like there. I think that the valuation exercise is [laughs] going to be really interesting for them, given how totally out-of-whack their financials have been in 2020. And you know, I mean, there's no certainty about when we'll get back to a period where they're more or less at cruising altitude and starting to get back into some serious growth. And I think that that's a major question mark for the business. So, I mean, if you're watching this company, you're interested in this company and you think that you might be wanting to scoop up some shares early, we say this a lot with IPOs, but I think it's particularly true here with all the uncertainty ahead of this business, it's worth taking a very small position to start. Hall: I agree. And that's most likely what I'll do pretty close to the IPO, is get some skin in the game. But if I could say this, the two metrics I'm going to be paying the most attention to, and it's to your point, are gross margins and revenue growth, because if it can hold those kinds of gross margins and continue to deliver double-digit revenue growth, it's more like a SaaS stock, it's more like a cloud stock, because you see all of the spending into developing that infrastructure to get to critical mass, and then those big losses, and it feels like overnight all of a sudden it starts pumping out these massive amounts of free cash flow. It's just incredible how these businesses, when they scale, how they do this. And I think that's what this could potentially be. Lewis: Yeah. I think during some of its more recent private valuation rounds, we've seen a valuation somewhere in the mid-$30 billion for this company. You know that would put them, based on some of their recent sales figures, at 7X sales. We're obviously going to see them probably priced well above that, but we're not getting into absurd land in valuation as a multiple of sales, even if it winds up going at quite a premium, based on that gross profit number. Hall: Just for some context, Hilton Worldwide Holdings is worth about $29 billion, and Marriott International is worth about $39 billion, so that's kind of where it puts it. And yeah, I don't think that's necessarily an extreme stretch considering how early it is in its business and how much it could continue to scale up. Lewis: Yeah. I think the viability of that really hinges on, OK, what does growth return to when we're back to normal? You know, is it in the 20s, if so, like, it deserves a premium valuation. If they're struggling to bring people in and it winds up being in the teens or low single-digits, then I think that that valuation comes under a lot more pressure. Hall: Yeah. And that's something we won't know for two years. Lewis: [laughs] Yeah. No, I mean, it's the ultimate waiting game debut. And I think some people are probably, honestly, kind of curious that they're even going public. And I wonder how much of that is cash needs and how much of it, frankly, it's just they were going to do it anyway, so they figured we're in a position where we can, we might as well. Hall: I don't think it's about time to do it, I think it's smart. I mean, you think about the amount of cash that the Fed has pumped into the economy, you think about where interest rates are, there's a lot of interest in stocks and this is going to fall right in the sweet spot of the information economy. I think it's smart to do it now. Lewis: Well, Jason, hopefully we'll be able to come back together again and [laughs] talk through some details once we have some firmer details on this issuance and on this stock, but until then, great talking with you, thank you so much for joining me on today's show. Hall: This was fun. Thanks, Dylan.

    "article_text":"By Elizabeth Culliford Nov 24 (Reuters) - YouTube said on Tuesday it had barred the right-wing outlet One America News Network from posting new videos for a week after it broke the site's rules against content that claims there is a guaranteed cure for COVID-19. A spokeswoman for YouTube, the video-sharing platform owned by Alphabet's Inc's Google, said OAN had also been suspended from monetizing its videos due to repeated violations of the COVID-19 misinformation policy and other rules. OAN will have to reapply to be allowed to monetize again. President Donald Trump has promoted OAN, calling it a \"great alternative\" to Fox News in a tweet this month. The outlet has amplified Trump's unsupported claims of voter fraud in the U.S. presidential election. YouTube said it has a \"three-strikes policy\" before an account is removed and this constituted OAN's first strike. OAN did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. The YouTube spokeswoman said an OAN video, now removed, had violated its coronavirus misinformation rules by claiming that hydroxychloroquine, an anti-malarial drug touted by Trump despite a lack of scientific evidence, was a cure for COVID-19. YouTube and other major online platforms are under scrutiny from lawmakers and researchers to curb misinformation on their sites. Following the November election, Reuters identified several YouTube channels making money from ads and memberships that were amplifying debunked accusations about voting fraud. At a congressional hearing last week with the CEOs of Facebook Inc and Twitter Inc, Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal criticized Google, YouTube's owner, saying it had been given a \"pass\" and was being rewarded for its \"timidity\" in content moderation. Four Democratic senators also sent a letter on Tuesday to YouTube's Chief Executive Officer Susan Wojcicki urging the video platform to remove content that they said spread misinformation on election results and pressing for information on measures taken ahead of the runoff U.S. Senate elections in Georgia.

After a channel receives three strikes, YouTube terminates it altogether. YouTube, part of Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google, is also suspending advertisements from the network for violating other unspecified policies. One America News, or OAN, is a favorite of U.S. President Donald Trump and its online audience rose this month after some Trump allies turned against Fox News, the conservative cable standard-bearer. Several OAN clips on YouTube falsely told viewers Trump won the Nov. 3 presidential election. YouTube removed ads on some of those clips, citing rules against \u201cundermining trust in the electoral process.\u201d But the company kept the footage up, an approach now facing criticism in Congress. YouTube says it does not consider OAN one of the authoritative news sources it surfaces to viewers. The network had more than 8 million views on YouTube the week of Nov. 9-13, more than its viewership in all of October, according to the analytics firm SocialBlade. In March, YouTube outlawed videos that promoted medically unsubstantiated advice about the coronavirus. Axios earlier reported YouTube\u2019s decision about OAN. \u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P."

    "article_text":"Apple AAPL recently asked a federal judge overseeing the Alphabet-owned GOOGL Google antitrust case to hide sensitive information from Google, per a Reuters report. Access to Apple's data could put the iPhone maker at a disadvantage when forging future deals with Google.The iPhone-maker and a number of major companies including Microsoft MSFT, Amazon AMZN, AT&T, Comcast, Duck Duck Go, Oracle, Sonos and T-Mobile among others have asked judge Amit Mehta of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia to designate certain data used in the Justice Department case as highly confidential.Notably, on Oct 20, the Justice Department issued its antitrust lawsuit against the search giant, suggesting that the company is unlawfully maintaining monopolies in the markets for general search services, search advertising, and general search text advertising in the United States.Alphabet holds a commanding lead in both search and video. The company dominates the search market \u2014 with roughly 90% of the world\u2019s Internet searches conducted on its platform \u2014 and roughly three quarters of American adults turn to YouTube for video, as The Wall Street Journal reported.Apple has already disclosed terms of its relationship with Google and expects to be asked for additional information. The company has urged that only Google's outside counsel be allowed to see any highly confidential data and not any in-house lawyers. Apple Inc. price-consensus-chart | Apple Inc. Quote Meanwhile, Apple\u2019s shares have returned 55.1% year to date compared with the Zacks Computer - Mini computers industry\u2019s growth of 54.2%.Apple, which does not have its own search engine, struck a multiyear deal making Google the default search engine on all iPhones and other Apple products. The company\u2019s web browser Safari, voice assistant Siri and device query feature, Spotlight all made Google the default choice.However, the lawsuit could prove more damaging for Apple in the immediate term if the agreement between the two companies is compromised.Markedly, Google pays Apple an estimated $8 billion to $12 billion a year, which makes up about 15% to 20% of Apple's global net income to be the default search engine on iOS devices by using its profits to maintain an edge over its rivals.The filing cites that Google estimates that 50% of its search traffic comes from Apple devices and the ad dollars that result from the relationship likely account for an even higher percentage of Alphabet\u2019s revenues.Any limitation on Apple's strategic relationship with Google or the potential loss of Google revenues will have a negative impact both in the immediate and longer term. However, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company is speculated to build its own search engine and sell search ads to make up for the loss in the future. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Moreover, Apple\u2019s services revenues (22.5% of total sales) have risen steadily and were up 16.3% in the last reported quarter to $14.55 billion, playing a big part in the company\u2019s top-line growth. But the Justice Department lawsuit reveals that nearly a quarter of that comes from Google, threatening the growth of the company\u2019s new cash-cow besides increasing scrutiny and legal woes over App Store.Meanwhile, Apple\u2019s App Store has been facing backlash from third-party developers over the past year for forcing them to pay a 30% cut and only use the company's own in-app purchasing system.

And some people have compared them not being paid, which is then-- and they're largely Black players too-- sort of a slavery system or at least being insensitive. Is that right to say? EMMANUEL ACHO: It's a little hyperbolic, probably a lot of hyperbolic to compare really anything to slavery. But comparison is having workers make minimal to no money, while those who may or working for are benefiting severely off the labor of the employees, as really the same parallel that's been drawn in the NFL. You have your owners making billions of dollars and your players on average are making $800,000. Well, you're making $800,000. How can you compare this to slavery? Because look at 800,000 compared to a billion, right. That would be $0.08 or something like that onto the dollar or 0.00, whatever the case may be. And so it's always hyperbolic when you're making the slavery comparison, but I do think that college players should be paid. ANDY SERWER: Right. It's just-- it's inequity, whether it's inequity in college or the NFL. What about corporate America, Emanuel? What can business people learn from sports in terms of addressing racial injustice? EMMANUEL ACHO: Business people can learn to create the common goal. What is the common goal? And you don't even have to think about football. Think about the Olympics. That's something we all get behind. At the Olympics, you'll see people decked out in their USA gear and whatnot, cheering on athletes that they don't know, women's soccer, men's soccer, track and field. Why? Because they're all banding behind the country to win over another country. You figured out the common opponent. What-- what corporations can realize is, wait a second, what is our common goal?

Malaysia's Transport Ministry this month overturned a so-called cabotage exemption granted in 2019 by the previous government that allowed the use of non-Malaysian vessels. Without this waiver, foreign vessels must apply for domestic shipping licensing exemption (DSLE), leading to longer repair times, the companies said in a letter to the Malaysian premier, which was cited by Malaysiakini in a report on Monday. \"It does not project regulatory stability or a policy environment that is conducive to foreign investment,\" the tech giants were quoted as saying by Malaysiakini. Reuters was unable to confirm the letter or details of the Malaysiakini report. Spokesmen for the Prime Ministers' office and the Transport Ministry both declined to comment. Facebook and Alphabet's Google declined to comment on the letter. Malaysia Internet Exchange, which the group agreed would communicate on its behalf, did not respond to requests for comment. Transport Minister Wee Ka Siong told parliament on Tuesday the decision to lift the cabotage exemption takes into consideration the outflow of foreign money via freight payments. \"The Transport Ministry's responsibility is to protect the interests of Malaysians and foster the domestic shipping industry, this was not a unilateral decision,\" Wee said.

The pending legal actions follow an antitrust lawsuit filed by the U.S. Justice Department against Alphabet's Google in October. The bipartisan group -- made up of Colorado, Iowa, Nebraska, New York, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Utah -- is sometimes referred to as the Colorado\/Nebraska group and has said it planned to combine its case with the federal government's. Google has broadly denied wrongdoing in response to the government's lawsuit and other probes, and the company said that its search engine and other products are dominant because consumers prefer them. Two people briefed on the matter said the Colorado\/Nebraska group planned to file their lawsuit around mid-December, with one of the people saying a filing was expected in federal district court. Texas led a group of attorneys general from 50 states and territories which announced a probe of Google in September 2019. Fast forward a year, and Texas is leading a group focused on online advertising technology while the Colorado\/Nebraska group has a broader probe under way. The Texas effort may be slowed by turmoil in the state attorney general's office. One source pointed to disruptions after recent media reports said the FBI was investigating accusations that Attorney General Ken Paxton abused his office to help a political donor. Several of Paxton's aides, who had become whistleblowers, resigned or were fired, including people who were key to the Google investigation. Texas has been aiming to find replacements, and it has promoted Shawn Cowles to be the deputy attorney general for civil litigation. But the turnover has led to delays. The Texas attorney general's office could not be reached for comment. The Colorado\/Nebraska group states' broader inquiry contrasts with the Justice Department's relatively narrow lawsuit, which focused on Google's efforts to build and retain its dominance in search and its search advertising business.

The states' expansive inquiry contrasts with the Justice Department's relatively narrow lawsuit, which focused on Google's efforts to build and retain its dominance in search and its search advertising business.

    "article_text":"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- What if your investing process was to start with the premise of finding attractive companies with the greatest growth potential \u2014 regardless of style, size, or location \u2014 and then buying those stocks? Figuring out the best home for them would seem almost secondary. Surprisingly, this is the opposite philosophy of how mutual funds typically operate. Most have preordained and well-defined parameters that limit what they can buy. Dennis Lynch, head of the Counterpoint Global group at Morgan Stanley Investment Management, has embraced the less common process. https:\/\/megaphone.link\/BLM2839849811 Counterpoint Global is a \u201cfirm within a firm\u201d at Morgan Stanley, managing about $130 billion. Several of the funds Lynch and his team manage \u2014 Inception, Discovery, Growth, Insight, Advantage & Permanence \u2014 have doubled in value this year and their long-term track record has been similarly outstanding. Lynch describes the group\u2019s process as somewhat unusual: Their 19 products are concentrated in just 200 companies. And they even use personality tests to shed insight into their stock-picking and decision-making. Lynch says the relative momentum of technology stocks during the big market drop in February and March was strong, and quickly translated into absolute strength as the market began to rally. He does not expect the torrid pace of growth to continue indefinitely, though he remains a long-term bull on technology and growth names. And while it\u2019s assumed that the economy will be substantially larger in 2022 than it has been during the pandemic and lockdowns, those expectations are reflected in current asset prices.

    "article_text":"  The U.K. competition regulator is considering a formal investigation into Google\u2019s new digital advertising tool, following a complaint from a group of online businesses that called on intervention to block the launch of the technology. On Monday, the Competition and Markets Authority acknowledged a complaint from Marketers For An Open Web (MOW), a consortium of \u201ckey stakeholders involved in web advertising\u201d including publishers and marketers. The Privacy Sandbox would replace cross-site tracking through cookies, which are pieces of data downloaded from sites when users visit them, and eventually remove the ability for third parties to track users with cookies. MOW is calling on the CMA to legally block the rollout of the Privacy Sandbox in 2021, which it says will move the online advertising industry off the open web and onto Google\u2019s dominant Chrome web browser, which would be beyond the reach of regulators. The changes that would be ushered in by the Privacy Sandbox include blocking online news publishers access to the cookies they require to target ads on their platforms, MOW said. This would cut revenues for publishers by up to two-thirds, the group said, citing a study by the CMA last summer on digital platforms and advertising. \u201cWe take the matters raised in the complaint very seriously, and will assess them carefully with a view to deciding whether to open a formal investigation under the Competition Act,\u201d said the CMA. \u201cIf the urgency of the concerns requires us to intervene swiftly, we will also assess whether to impose interim measures to order the suspension of any suspected anticompetitive conduct pending the outcome of a full investigation,\u201d the regulator said. James Rosewell, the director of MOW, said that the efforts of regulators to temper Google\u2019s online dominance will be in vain if the Privacy Sandbox is launched before changes to law. \u201cIf Google releases this technology they will effectively own the means by which media companies, advertisers and technology businesses reach their consumers and that change will be irreversible,\u201d said Rosewell. The CMA has recommended that the U.K. government introduce a new, pro-competition regulatory regime specifically targeting Google and Facebook\u2019s market power. By the end of the year, the regulator will advise the government on how the regulatory regime for digital markets should be designed. Google pushed back on the allegations made by the consortium of online businesses, citing the role the Privacy Sandbox will play in facilitating transparency around user data, but didn\u2019t address the competition concerns. \u201cThe ad-supported web is at risk if digital advertising practices don\u2019t evolve to reflect people\u2019s changing expectations around how data is collected and used,\u201d Google said. \u201cThat is why Google introduced the Privacy Sandbox, an open initiative built in collaboration with the industry, to provide strong privacy for users while also supporting publishers.\u201d"

    "article_text":"  Google Cloud is joining with a small British bank to develop a new type of platform that mixes the personal relationships of traditional banking with the technology and infrastructure of new digital banks. Cynergy Bank says that its partnership with Google Cloud and information technology services provider Wipro will allow it to become a \u201cdigital relationship bank.\u201d The banking platform that Cynergy says will be \u201ca seamless blend of a face-to-face relationship that is enabled by the latest digital technology\u201d is set to launch in February or March 2021, and is targeted at fast-growing small- and medium-size businesses. While the bank wouldn\u2019t disclose the value of its deal with Google Cloud, Cynergy Chief Executive Nick Fahy, told MarketWatch that \u201cour investment is tens of millions of pounds.\u201d The bank said that it will fill a gap between digital banks, like Monzo, which are focused on app-based delivery, and large retail banks that use what Cynergy calls a \u201cone size fits all approach\u201d to small and medium-size commercial clients. Cynergy will rely on the platform from Google Cloud to allow clients to do much of their banking online, including speaking with bank representatives, while still keeping the option for in-person and over the phone meetings with advisers. Fahy said that bank relationship managers currently spend around 30% of their time dealing with clients and 70% on internal processes, and the new model hopes to flip that ratio on its head, allowing bankers to spend the majority of their time in client-facing work. Other goals of the new platform include scaling fast and efficient lending decisions, and developing a new range of digital lending and savings products. Fahy said the bank hopes the new platform and services will boost its customer base from 80,000 to between 300,000 and 500,000 within the next three years. Cynergy Bank was formerly the U.K. wing of the Bank of Cyprus, and was sold in 2018 to a group of private investors for \u00a3103 million ($138 million). Google Cloud said that \u201cthe exciting part\u201d of the partnership is that the novel banking model will mix elements of traditional banking with the infrastructure of a digital bank. \u201cThis is ideal for small and medium businesses that need the capability and capacity to grow fast,\u201d said Adrian Poole, head of financial services at Google Cloud Platform for the U.K. and Ireland. The partnership between Google Cloud and Cynergy Bank comes as cloud services, dominated by tech giants, are increasingly becoming critical to financial services companies. Last week, Alphabet said that it would allow customers to apply for digital bank accounts through the Google Pay wallet."

    "url":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/snap-pay-1-million-day-140000603.html",
    "article_text":"(Bloomberg) -- Snap Inc. is rolling out a new tool for its Snapchat app to feature popular videos, called Spotlight, and said it will pay out $1 million a day to creators of the top-performing posts. To earn the money, video submitters to Spotlight don\u2019t have to have large followers -- or even have public profiles. Instead, an algorithm will determine what to show Snapchat users based on how often others view the post. If others view the same video repeatedly, for instance, that\u2019s a signal it\u2019s catching on and will spur the algorithm to distribute it more widely. The new feature will help Snapchat in a competitive market for posting entertaining videos online, dominated by Facebook Inc.\u2019s Instagram and Google\u2019s YouTube, with China-based ByteDance Ltd.\u2019s TikTok rising fast among younger audiences. Snap Chief Executive Officer Evan Spiegel has eschewed public metrics, such as likes and follows, that drive the market for influencers, the most-followed users on photo-sharing apps. On Snapchat, which hit 249 million daily active users in the third quarter, likes are private, there is no re-sharing of videos and displaying follower numbers is optional. Without those metrics, though, it\u2019s harder for users to get popular, noticed by brands and hired to create sponsored content -- the main way young social media stars make a living. Spiegel wants Spotlight to reward popular videos without their creators having to worry about consistency or the number of followers. Social media platforms are striving to attract the makers of quality content. TikTok plans to spend more than $1 billion in the U.S. in the next three years on video-makers. Instagram has been paying some of TikTok\u2019s top stars to test out its TikTok copycat feature, Reels. Instagram also recently started for the first time sharing revenue on video ads with creators, like YouTube does. It\u2019s unclear whether the random chance for a big payout will pull users\u2019 great ideas away from TikTok and Instagram, but Snap provides a unique option: a video\u2019s maker can choose to be private, offering a break from influencer culture. Snap has previously benefited by betting on a product that lowers pressure for users. Stories, the Snapchat videos that disappear after 24 hours, became so popular that the product has been copied by Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter Inc. Other companies have tried the payout strategy in the past, including the game-show app HQ Trivia. But most users don\u2019t win those prizes, and the novelty of competing for them can wear off quickly. Snap shares have almost tripled this year to a record $45.38 earlier this month as young people turn to Snapchat to message friends videos during the coronavirus. The app also features television shows and magazines designed for a young audience on mobile. Spotlight will start in the U.S., Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the U.K., Ireland, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Germany, and France, the company said. \u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P."

    "url":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/digital-marketing-firms-file-uk-134636289.html",
    "article_text":"\"[Our] letter is asking for the introduction of Privacy Sandbox to be delayed until such measures are put in place,\" they write in a press release. The group, which is badging itself as Marketers for an Open Web (MOW), says it's comprised of \"businesses in the online ecosystem who share a concern that Google is threatening the open web model that is vital to the functioning of a free and competitive media and online economy\". The CMA confirmed to us that it's received MOW's complaint, adding that some of the coalition's concerns reflect issues identified in a detailed review of the online ad market it published this summer. However it has not yet taken a decision on whether or not to investigate. \"We can confirm we have received a complaint regarding Google raising certain concerns, some of which relate to those we identified in our online platforms and digital advertising market study,\" said the CMA spokesperson. \"We take the matters raised in the complaint very seriously, and will assess them carefully with a view to deciding whether to open a formal investigation under the Competition Act. \"If the urgency of the concerns requires us to intervene swiftly, we will also assess whether to impose interim measures to order the suspension of any suspected anti-competitive conduct pending the outcome of a full investigation.\" Although the regulator chose not to take any enforcement action at that point -- preferring to wait for the UK government to come forward with pro-competition legislation. In its statement today, the CMA makes it clear it could still choose to act on related competition concerns if it feels an imperative to do so -- including potentially blocking the launch of Privacy Sandbox to allow time for a full investigation -- while it waits for legislators to come up with a regulatory framework. Though, again, it has not made any decisions yet. Reached for a response to the MOW complaint, Google sent us this statement -- attributed to a spokesperson: Also commenting in a statement, MOW's director Roswell said: \u201cThe concept of the open web is based on a decentralised, standards-based environment that is not under the control of any single commercial organisation. This model is vital to the health of a free and independent media, to a competitive digital business environment and to the freedom and choice of all web users. Privacy Sandbox creates new, Google-owned standards and is an irreversible step towards a Google-owned \u2018walled garden\u2019 web where they control how businesses and users interact online.\u201d One component of the UID2 proposal consists of a \"Unified ID Service\" that it says would apply a salt and hash process to the PII to generate UID2 and encrypting that to create a UID2 Token, as well as provision login requests from publishers to access the token. The other component is a user facing website that's described as a \"transparency & consent service\" -- to handle user requests for data or UID2 logouts etc. However the proposal by the online ad industry to centralize Internet users' identity by attaching it to hashed pieces of actual personal data -- and with a self-regulating \"Trusted Ads Ecosystem\" slated to be controlling the mapping of PII to UID2 -- seems unlikely to assuage the self-same privacy concerns fuelling the demise of tracking cookies in the first place (to put it mildly). Trusting the mass surveillance industry to self regulate a centralized ID system for Internet users is for the birds. But adtech players are clearly hoping they can buy themselves enough time to cobble together a self-serving cookie alternative -- and sell it to regulators as a competition remedy. (Their parallel bet is they can buy off inactive privacy regulators with dubious claims of 'transparency and consent'.) So it will certainly be interesting to see whether the adtech industry succeeds in forcing competition regulators to stand in the way of platform-level privacy reforms, while pulling off a major reorg and rebranding exercise of privacy-hostile tracking operations. So that's one bit of strategic pushback. A flagship online ad industry tool for gathering web users' consent to tracking is also under attack and looks to be facing imminent action under the bloc's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Last month an investigation by Belgium's data protection agency found the IAB Europe's so-called Transparency and Consent Framework (TCF) didn't offer either -- failing to meet the GDPR standard for transparency, fairness and accountability, and the lawfulness of data processing. Enforcement action is expected in early 2021."

    "article_text":"(Bloomberg) -- Google\u2019s planned changes to advertising data were targeted by a group of rivals who pushed U.K. regulators to make the company a top antitrust priority. Marketers for an Open Web is asking the Competition and Markets Authority to temporarily halt Google\u2019s rollout of so-called privacy sandbox technology next year, it said in an emailed statement on Monday. The group said the changes will curb members\u2019 ability to gather information on web users, which helps them offer more valuable advertising. It\u2019s urging the CMA to use its power to protect smaller media companies at risk of losing as much as 75% of their revenue. Google upended the advertising world with its decision earlier this year to phase out third-party cookies that help advertisers pinpoint customers with ads for websites they previously visited and monitor which ads convinced them to buy. Google\u2019s Chrome is used by the majority of internet users and the changes will be followed by browsers based on Google\u2019s Chromium technology such as Microsoft Corp.\u2019s Edge. The CMA said it took \u201cthe matters raised in the complaint very seriously and will assess them carefully with a view to deciding whether to open a formal investigation. \u201cWe will also assess whether to impose interim measures to order the suspension of any suspected anti-competitive conduct pending the outcome of a full investigation,\u201d the regulator said in a statement. Google said the ad-supported web was \u201cat risk if digital advertising practices don\u2019t evolve to reflect people\u2019s changing expectations around how data is collected and used.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s why Google introduced the privacy sandbox, an open initiative built in collaboration with the industry, to provide strong privacy for users while also supporting publishers,\u201d the company said in a statement. Online advertising that fuels tech giants\u2019 massive revenues and market power is already a focus for the U.K regulator. The CMA will become a key antitrust authority for global firms when the transition period following the U.K.\u2019s departure from the EU runs out at the end of the year. The regulator said in a July report that phasing out of third-party cookies could hurt publishers\u2019 ability to make money and invest in online content. It\u2019s used Google data to estimate that U.K. publishers \u201cearned around 70% less revenue overall when they were unable to use third-party cookies to sell personalized advertising but competed against others who could.\u201d Google has more than a 90% share of the 7.3 billion-pound ($9.7 billion) U.K. search market, the CMA said in July. The regulator has pleaded for a new digital markets taskforce to tackle \u201cwide-ranging and self-reinforcing\u201d concerns in online advertising. Marketers for an Open Web said Google\u2019s changes will deny news publishers access to the cookies they use to sell advertising. It also complain advertisers and publishers will learn less about web users from Google\u2019s push to encourage users to sign in to Chrome instead of individual website. The complaint says data collection will move from the open web -- where it\u2019s used by a number of companies -- and \u201cinto the walled garden of its Chrome browser.\u201d French online advertisers last month asked the French antitrust authority to act on Apple Inc.\u2019s planned move to limit the collection of iPhone users\u2019 data.

    "article_text":"(Bloomberg) -- Foxconn Technology Group plans to assemble key components for Google servers from its plant in Wisconsin, people familiar with the matter said, finally breathing life into a factory Donald Trump hailed as crucial to bringing manufacturing back to the U.S. The Taiwanese company has decided to locate production for this new contract at the existing complex rather than make the components at home or in China, the people said, asking not to be identified discussing a sensitive move. The under-utilized factory should start mass production in the first quarter, timed with the release of Intel Corp.\u2019s Ice Lake server chips, they said. Foxconn is setting up surface-mount technology assembly lines that it will use to place semiconductors onto circuit boards, they added. Foxconn, known also as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., is one of several Taiwanese firms exploring ways to expand in America and lessen a reliance on Chinese production bases. The company has also sought to diversify a business that counts on Apple Inc. for half its revenue, including by courting more American clients. On Thursday, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. won city-level incentives for a $12 billion chip plant in Phoenix, another step toward bringing high-tech manufacture back to the U.S. and addressing security concerns over the industry\u2019s supply chain.

Taiwan counts Washington as an essential diplomatic, economic and military ally amid rising tensions with Beijing. Foxconn, which operates most of its factories in central and southern China, won Google\u2019s business because it was the only contract manufacturer capable of establishing a surface-mount technology line on American soil, one of the people said. Shanghai-listed Foxconn Industrial Internet Co., its cloud business unit, will oversee the server business in Wisconsin, another person familiar with Foxconn\u2019s operations said. The plant in Wisconsin was unveiled to much fanfare in 2018 by Foxconn Chairman Terry Gou and Trump, who called it \u201cthe Eighth Wonder of the World.\u201d Once envisioned as the centerpiece of a Made in America effort that would create 13,000 jobs for the Badger State, it instead succumbed to delays and switched directions several times after local officials slashed subsidies. The company missed its first-year hiring target by a wide margin, ending 2018 with just 178 full-time employees. And rather than the promised large-sized display panels, it began churning out face masks and ventilators this year. Yet its location in the heart of America is now a boon to Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google, which is trying to win lucrative contracts for its server-dependent cloud business. The U.S. company considers it an important area for the company\u2019s growth, but one in which Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft Corp. dominate. An American base could help Foxconn court U.S. government contracts, particularly as Washington ramps up scrutiny over a largely Chinese-focused global electronics supply chain. \u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P."

    "article_text":"In this episode of Influencers, Andy speaks with former NFL player and 'Uncomfortable Conversations with a Black Man' author, Emmanuel Acho, about opening a dialogue about race and addressing the issue of racism in America. ANDY SERWER: America is in the midst of a racial reckoning, fresh off of a wave of protests in the summer and a divisive election in the fall. With tensions at a boil, opponents dig in, and dialogue stops. Emmanuel Acho wants to keep the conversation going. The Fox Sports host and former NFL linebacker invites people, especially white people, to talk about race on his YouTube show, \"Uncomfortable Conversations with a Black Man.\" His 65 million views and counting have made the show an instant success. And with help from Oprah Winfrey, he just released a book by the same title. On this episode of \"Influencers,\" Emmanuel Acho joins me to talk about which questions white people are afraid to ask, why he rejects cancel culture, and whether the perception of the NFL will change after the Trump presidency. [MUSIC PLAYING] Hello, everyone, and welcome to \"Influencers.\" I'm Andy Serwer. And welcome to our guest, Emmanuel Acho, who is a former NFL player, host of Fox Sports 1 \"Speak For Yourself,\" and author of the new book, \"Uncomfortable Conversations with a Black Man.\" Emmanuel, great to see you. EMMANUEL ACHO: Andy, good to be seen. Good to be talking to you, my friend. ANDY SERWER: Thank you. So you started this off, conversations-- \"Uncomfortable Conversations with a Black Man\" as a YouTube show, and it amassed more than 65 million views from when you started it in June. What were you hoping to achieve when you started that, and why do you think it's resonated so widely? EMMANUEL ACHO: Man, great question, Andy. I was hoping to act as a bridge for racial reconciliation. Andy, I went to an affluent white school from grades five through 12, and I was immersed in white culture. But then, Andy, I got offered a scholarship to play football at the University of Texas, and then I go to the NFL. So now I'm immersed in Black culture. Andy, what I've realized is there is a communication difference between white people, white culture, and Black people, Black culture. Because I've been immersed in both cultures, I understand, Andy, there is a difference. And that communication barrier is playing a factor in our racial tension right now, a huge factor. Sure, we all speak English. But make no mistake about it, there are differences in ways we communicate and interpret things. So I said, you know what, Andy? I'm going to preemptively answer questions that I know my white brothers and sisters have but either are too afraid to ask or don't have a Black person to ask or Black people to ask, such as, wait a second, how come white people can't say the n-word but Black people can? Wait, Emmanuel, but what about Black-on-Black crime in Chicago? OK, what's this concept of white privilege? But Emmanuel, what about reverse racism? Black people get a Black History Month. White people don't get a White History Month. OK, but isn't affirmative action just the same thing as, like, the Jim Crow laws? So I preemptively said, you know what, Andy? Let me answer so many of these questions that are leaving my white brothers and sisters in ignorance. ANDY SERWER: Yeah, and then you turned it into this book right here, which has been really resonating with people as well. And I've been-- I'm in the midst of it right now, and I love the question format. Because you're right, so many people-- white people-- are asking those questions right now, Emmanuel. And-- so are you getting the kind of responses that you hoped to? In other words, are people saying, oh, you know, now I do understand? And how are you-- EMMANUEL ACHO: Oh. ANDY SERWER: --getting that communicated to you? EMMANUEL ACHO: I love that. I really am, Andy. And the best response I got was week one into the episode-- it was a sweet woman named Lynn, 73-year-old white woman. She said dear Emmanuel, I grew up in the South in rural Alabama in the '40s and '50s. I didn't go to school with any Negroes, she said. But after watching your episode, I realized my heart still needs to change. Please don't give up on me yet. I love you, my brother and my son. And Andy, after I got that email, I said, wait a second. The hearts are changing. Hearts are turning. This isn't about clicks. This isn't about likes. This isn't about shares. This is about influencing this generation and the next generation. So let's write a book, which can be passed down from generation to generation and affect true, meaningful change. I don't just want the spoken word, which is sizzle. I need the written word, which is substantive. And that's what will really make a change. So the appetite, Andy, has been insatiable it seems like. The more I give people, the more they want. Emmanuel, make the episodes longer. I wish you could expand on this. And so that's how we're going right now. ANDY SERWER: You know, on the one hand, we're seeing white and Black people come together. But unfortunately, it's on one side of the political aisle. You know, you're seeing a lot of white people at Black Lives Matters protests, more than a lot of people anticipated, you know, in Connecticut and Michigan and Pennsylvania. On the other hand, you have the Proud Boys, a lot of Trump supporters who might not see eye to eye with this still. How can we bring this country together? EMMANUEL ACHO: Well, I would say the first thing, Andy, is we all have to collectively get out of denial. I said this before to Oprah when her and I were talking. Denial, spelled D-E-N-I-A-L-- don't even know I am lying. And you can't fix a problem, Andy, that you don't know exists. So how can we all collectively move forward? Acknowledge a problem exists. You mentioned it at the top of this. I'm a sports guy. Let me talk sports with y'all real quick. In the NFL, the reason that so many people can be of different races, different religions, different backgrounds, Andy, and still come together is because they're fighting a common enemy. When I walk out onto the field, which is 53 and 1\/3 wide and 100 yards long, I remember that, wait a second, me and my brother to my left and my right are fighting a common enemy. So I don't care what my brother looks like. I don't care who my brother worships Because we're on a goal to beat the opponent. In America, Andy, we haven't yet realized we're fighting a common enemy of oppression. We're fighting a common enemy of racism. We're fighting a common enemy of systemic injustice. And as a result, we're bickering with our brothers and sisters to our left and our right instead of realizing, no, it's us versus oppression. It's not Black versus white. It's not white versus Black. It's good versus evil. It's love versus hate. ANDY SERWER: Do you think we can get there? I mean, well, let me hold that one for a second. Social media-- I mean, a lot of people are suggesting that's making the situation-- the divisiveness worse. What's your take on that? EMMANUEL ACHO: Social media does two things. It can make the divisiveness worse because it gives everyone a platform, and they can also hide. And so it gives people a platform that-- but they can also maintain anonymity, and that's the worst part. Like, if everyone on social media had to put their actual first and last name, it'd be a completely different agenda. But social media also has some pros. Again, my-- this-- my show, my concept, my book, it wouldn't have occurred without social media. And I know that that has done plenty of good. So with social media, you have to understand, there's bad, but there is also some good involved. ANDY SERWER: All right, let's get back to that other question, Emmanuel. How optimistic are you about this systemic change that we're trying to undertake? EMMANUEL ACHO: I'm optimistic, Andy, because I finally realized that hearts are ready to change and that it's not so much that I finally realized. The hearts are finally ready to change. After the murder of George Floyd, Andy, it was as though our white brothers and sisters were like, wait a second, maybe Black people haven't been lying this whole time. Maybe there is a problem. Maybe, like, this racial injustice and racially-motivated incidents-- maybe it's not just a coincidence. And so I think the harshness of that tragedy of George Floyd, it woke everyone up. And now it's just a matter of-- now that people are awake and now that the intentions are there, is there direction? See, Andy, intention without direction is meaningless. So there's now intention. And I, with this book and with my series, I'm trying to give people direction. ANDY SERWER: I hear you there. Throughout his presidency, Donald Trump has criticized NFL players. Do you think the perception of the league and its players will shift after Donald Trump leaves office? EMMANUEL ACHO: It's a good question. I think that the perception of the players-- I don't know that it's so much affected by the presidency. What I mean by that is one man nor one woman should be able to dictate your feelings and emotions on oppression, injustice, and racism. Like, these are historical contexts with generational meanings. So what one person tells you, whether it's Emmanuel Acho, whether it's a president, whoever it is, that shouldn't completely dictate your feelings about something. Do your homework. Do your research. Let your own empathy be created through your own understanding. So I don't think one person can single-handedly dictate the emotions about an-- about a collective system or organization. ANDY SERWER: You've said the NFL has the right intentions but needs to take it in the right direction. What concrete steps do you think the NFL should take to support the fight for racial justice? EMMANUEL ACHO: Well, the first thing is everybody has to understand the fight. I sat down with commissioner of the NFL, Roger Goodell. Yeah, he's the commissioner. But to a degree, he can have all the authority and no power at times. Remember, there are 32 organizations, 32 different cities-- different teams, not 32 different cities but enough different cities. The need in the different cities is different. So it can't be just one one-size-fits-all type of mantra. The need in Dallas is different than the need in Los Angeles, which is different than the need in Phoenix or Glendale, Arizona. The individual owners have to collectively realize, what does my city need? But how does that start? It starts by talking to your players. Roger Goodell said, yeah, I heard about the injustice, but it wasn't until I went on a ride-along that I really understood it. These owners, they're hearing things. Oh, I see my players are kneeling, raising a fist. But do they really understand it? It has to go from head knowledge to heart knowledge. ANDY SERWER: And when you had Roger Goodell on, Emmanuel, I think it was in August, he offered an apology to Colin Kaepernick. But Colin Kaepernick still has not been signed by a team. Is this collusion? Do you think he'll ever go back to the NFL? EMMANUEL ACHO: No, I don't think Colin Kaepernick will play in the NFL, but there are so many variables to this. What do I mean by that? In the NFL, every organization runs a cost-benefit analysis. How much will it cost us to have you on our organization, and how much will you benefit us? So if you're an NFL organization, especially four years removed, in regards to Colin Kaepernick, now you're weighing the risk-reward. OK, he'll come in, and obviously, he'll be anywhere from a second to a third-string quarterback right now. Is having Colin Kaepernick as the second or third-string quarterback worth the questions that every player will now get asked, that we will now get asked, and is it worth the distraction that the media will create-- not Colin Kaepernick necessarily, but the media will create. So because of that, I don't think that Colin Kaepernick would get signed. I also think that-- I don't know, sometimes there's an impasse. Remember, let's talk Cam Newton for a second. Cam Newton didn't want to be a backup quarterback. He wanted to be a starter. And as a result, there was only one team that wanted to make him a starter. Eric Reid, someone who has been proudly known to be standing by Colin Kaepernick, very justifiably so, the Washington Football Team, they offered him a place on their practice squad. Eric Reid turned it down because Eric Reid views himself as a starter. And so just because you want to play doesn't necessarily mean that the position that will be offered to you that you do, in fact, want. So become about the nuances regarding that, I personally don't see Colin Kaepernick playing in the NFL. ANDY SERWER: So was the situation where the owners didn't want him for a while and now Father Time has entered into the equation as well a little bit, perhaps, too. EMMANUEL ACHO: I would say it's a combination of everything. It's the owners don't want what the media will bring with that, number one. And number two, this is so detailed and it's so multifaceted. But until the owners can also get their fans to understand it wasn't about disrespecting the flag, it was about a just cause, then the owners, who are always worried about bottom line, who are always worried about their dollars now are going to run the risk of losing their dollars for the sake of Colin Kaepernick. And unfortunately, owners just aren't that selfless. Like, you don't become a billionaire by being selfless. That's not how it works. ANDY SERWER: And as you were saying too, Emmanuel, different cities, different owners, different politics, it's all-- EMMANUEL ACHO: Correct. ANDY SERWER: --part of that equation, as you said. You mentioned the 32 owners. Only two of them are people of color, and only three non-interim head coaches are Black. Wow. It seems like there's a long way to go there, too, right? EMMANUEL ACHO: Yeah, but the issue, Andy, is that so many people think the NFL is a meritocracy. However hard you work, you'll earn your success. It's not. It's really based off nepotism and cronyism. Nepotism, you hire your family. And cronyism, you hire your friends. Historically, if the NFL was founded by white men and white men are hiring their family-- nepotism, white men. They're hiring their friends-- cronyism, white men. So how do you think that the NFL will change if it's historically founded by white men who are looking out for other white men? It won't. And so that's why it's not a coincidence when you see only three out of 32 coaches full time who began the season or whatever the statistic may be are Black. That's not a coincidence. That's just the way in which our world at large works, and the NFL is a reflection of that. ANDY SERWER: You're talking about these owners, these white men, and a vast majority of their political donations went to Republicans. And some of those politicians-- or many of them-- criticized the racial justice protests, including kneeling by NFL players. So this is just part of the politics. You have a lot of Black players and a lot of owners who are white and have, let's just say, not such progressive political perspectives, correct? EMMANUEL ACHO: Yeah, that's part of the-- the real problem is just a lack of understanding. And that's what-- all of this all boils down to-- the nucleus, the crux of the issue is a lack of understanding. Remember, Roger Goodell, he, for so long, said, I didn't realize what the players were kneeling about. Like, Colin Kaepernick, he definitely took some missteps, definitely. He would admit that, I would assume. Like, wearing the pig socks? Not a great idea. But at the heart of his issue was protesting systemic injustice and police brutality. What have we seen come to a head in 2020? Police brutality and systemic injustice. So it-- but it just now took Roger Goodell four years to realize what's really been going on. So imagine how many other people who haven't realized that. Roger Goodell is one of the savviest, smartest, wisest businessmen you'll come across, and he didn't realize what it was about. So how can you expect other people to have figured it out by now? Again, it's all just a communication thing and, to a degree, a denial thing. ANDY SERWER: Is it hypocritical if owners who, on one hand, support Donald Trump over here and on the other hand, make donations to, say, social justice causes? Or is that just-- is that OK? Can you do that? EMMANUEL ACHO: Yeah, I don't think it's hypocritical. Again, support who you support. You have to figure out your motivation for your support, but I will never tell someone what to do. I will tell them why I do what I do and why I think what I do is right. But I'm-- I can't criticize or crucify people for supporting who they support. I would wonder their intentions behind it, and I would ask them the why. But I won't come out and blanketly offer a general statement of you shouldn't support this person or you should support that person. It's really just understanding why you're doing what you're doing. ANDY SERWER: I'm going to leave the NFL and go over to the WNBA, OK? And ask you about Kelly Loeffler, who is a Republican senator from Georgia who owns the Atlanta Dream, who has criticized Black Lives Matters' protesters. Do you think that league should remove her as an owner? EMMANUEL ACHO: I don't think cancel culture, which is what that is essentially alluding to, is ever positive. Because if you cancel somebody, you don't give them the opportunity to grow. You don't give them the opportunity to mature. You don't give them the opportunity to evolve. I think that group-- I think the WNBA should educate her. Now, if she is refusing, like anyone, education, at that point in time, you have to figure out decisions to make. Again, I don't know all the nuances beyond-- with that case, but I don't believe in cancel culture. I believe in education, which breeds growth. Again, there is a difference between Black Lives Matter the noun, the group, and Black lives matter the adjective, simply saying that Black people's lives do, in fact, matter. You will not and you have not ever heard of Emmanuel Acho speak about Black Lives Matter, the group. What I speak about is saying that Black lives do, in fact, matter. And so I don't believe in canceling people, to answer your question, because there's no growth there. ANDY SERWER: Right, makes sense. Let me ask you a little bit about college football and whether the players there should be paid. And some people have compared them not being paid, which is-- and they're largely Black players, to sort of a slavery system, or at least being insensitive. Is that right to say? EMMANUEL ACHO: It's a little hyperbolic-- probably a lot of hyperbolic-- to compare really anything the slavery. The comparison is having workers make minimal to no money while those whom they are working for are benefiting severely off the labor of the employees. As-- it's really the same parallel that's been drawn in the NFL. You have your owners making billions of dollars, and your players, on average, are making $800,000. Well, you're making $800,000. How could you compare this to slavery? Because look at $800,000 compared to $1 billion, right? That would be-- what, $0.008 or something like that onto the dollar, or $0.00, whatever the case may be. And so it's always hyperbolic when you're making the slavery comparison, but I do think that college players should be paid. ANDY SERWER: Right, it's just-- it's inequity, whether it's inequity in college or the NFL. What about corporate America, Emmanuel? What can business people learn from sports, in terms of addressing racial injustice? EMMANUEL ACHO: Business people can learn to create the common goal. What is the common goal? And you don't even have to think about football. Think about the Olympics. That's something we all get behind. At the Olympics, you'll see people decked out in their USA gear and whatnot cheering on athletes that they don't know-- women's soccer, men's soccer, track and field. Why? Because they're all banding behind the country to win over another country. You figured out the common opponent. What corporations can realize is, wait a second, what is our common goal? And let's all, as a company, get behind our common goal. That's the only way people can look past their differences. ANDY SERWER: Emmanuel, what about this crazy new business of yours, which is being a sportscaster, right? I mean, that's got to have its own foibles, problems, issues when it comes to race? EMMANUEL ACHO: Yeah, the-- really, for being a sportscaster is just making sure you don't get boxed in. That's where the beautiful part of me being the host currently with my co-host, another Black man by the name of Marcellus Wiley-- as a former football player, they will just make you an analyst. You're just-- you've got to be an analyst. Break down the tape. You don't see a lot of Black hosts on TV. I think Marcellus and I might be the first combination of Black hosts for a national show on a daily basis. You don't see a ton of Black hosts. And so for me, it's just a matter of not ever getting boxed in because of my former profession or because of my race. ANDY SERWER: I used to watch Marcellus Wiley right up the road here. I'm talking to you from Manhattan. He played at Columbia-- EMMANUEL ACHO: Yeah. ANDY SERWER: --right? Right up here. He was a fantastic football player in the Ivy League, and he was one of the few to get to the NFL, right? EMMANUEL ACHO: Absolutely, and he'll tell you about it every time he gets the chance. But Marcellus Wiley, he's one of those who really-- he put his value on education, and you're seeing the dividend, having just as successful a career after football as he ever did in football. ANDY SERWER: Yeah, some people have criticized, you know, ESPN for-- which is-- you used to work there-- for sticking to sports and not getting into politics. I mean, it's got to be tougher now to do sports than it was, you know, five or 10 years ago where you could just-- you didn't have to pay attention to the social issues at all, right? EMMANUEL ACHO: It's tougher to do everything now. The world we live in is just so incredibly sensitive, and people are waiting with stones in hand to cancel you based on one wrong word, one wrong sentence, one wrong thought, one wrong statistic. So you have to be even more careful. But Andy, I believe to whom much is given, much is required. And so if you're on TV, if you're a sports person, a sports analyst, anything, a lot's been given to you. Therefore, you are required and have a responsibility to, as best you can, be accurate with the information you're given. ANDY SERWER: And you feel comfortable at Fox? I mean, a lot of people would say, wow, you're-- you have these opinions. And let's be honest here-- because that's what you talked about in your book, ask the tough questions. Fox, not necessarily known for the most progressive company in the world. And you feel like you're able to do your job there? EMMANUEL ACHO: Yeah, my job is to positively contribute to society. My job beyond being a sports analyst, beyond being a Black man is being a human being, and my job is to leave this world better than I found it. I try not to put myself in compromising positions. And as you'll notice in the book, \"Uncomfortable Conversations with a Black Man,\" I'm not divisive. Your experience is your expertise. I'm speaking from my experience because that is my expertise. ANDY SERWER: Is there any way you could take this show on the road? I mean, you've got YouTube. You're on Fox right now. But, like, how else have you thought about, you know, bringing your message across? Can you do, like-- well, we can't do in-person things anymore, so we can forget that idea. But just in terms of consulting with CEOs or going to Washington, testifying before Congress, have you had any opportunities to do that? EMMANUEL ACHO: Well, I speak-- I've spoken to probably 80 or so companies already via Zooms, diversity and inclusion speaking. You know, I got called by a four-star general to come speak to a branch of our military. And so I've definitely been reached out to by so many companies, and I encourage them to reach out. Like, don't let the blind lead the blind. Figure out the direction you want to go, and couple that with your good intent. ANDY SERWER: And what kind of aspirations do you have right now for yourself professionally, Emmanuel, in terms of broadcasting or maybe even beyond or doing things in addition to that? EMMANUEL ACHO: You know, Andy, I don't believe in setting goals. I believe in having an objective with no limitations. I got my masters in sports psychology, and my final paper was on having an objective with no limitations instead of setting goals. So my objective is just to continue changing the world, continue trying to be a bridge for racial reconciliation, continue to try to lead to healing and understanding between my white brothers and sisters and my Black brothers and sisters. ANDY SERWER: You want to know something really weird, Emmanuel? We see it right over that shoulder there. You see that animal? EMMANUEL ACHO: So-- it looks like a longhorn. ANDY SERWER: Yeah, well-- yes. So here's the thing. It's a bull because, you know, Wall Street and all that, right? That's me. But it is actually a longhorn, and you're a Longhorn, right? EMMANUEL ACHO: Absolutely. ANDY SERWER: And the last person I talked to, the last interview I did just two days ago was another Longhorn, Matthew McConaughey. EMMANUEL ACHO: All right, all right, all right. ANDY SERWER: Exactly. It's like a whole Longhorn festival going on here with-- the last couple days. So just to wrap things up here, I'm curious about what you think, in your heart of hearts-- what you hope America can look like, say, a few years from now when maybe we're a little bit more together again. EMMANUEL ACHO: Andy, I'll tell you how I end my book. I say that racism is not a-- racial equality is not a finish line that we'll cross. It's a road that we will travel. Unlike in a football game-- the objective is to cross the goal line and get a touchdown and put six points on the board. Racial equality isn't like that. We have to choose to travel the road together. So what does a world with equality look like? It looks like Black people, white people, different cultures, brown people, light people celebrating our accomplishments together, mourning with one another, rejoicing with one another, but doing it in peace and unity and in love. ANDY SERWER: Now, that is a vision I can buy into. Emmanuel Acho, author of the new book, \"Uncomfortable Conversations with a Black Man,\" thank you so much for your time. EMMANUEL ACHO: Thank you, my man. ANDY SERWER: You've been watching \"Influencers.\" I'm Andy Serwer. We'll see you next time."

So it can't be just one one-size-fits-all type of mantra. The need in Dallas is different than the need in Los Angeles, which is different than the need in Phoenix or Glendale, Arizona. The individual owners have to collectively realize, what does my city need? But how does that start? It starts by talking to your players. Roger Goodell said, yeah, I heard about the injustice, but it wasn't until I went on a ride-along that I really understood it. These owners, they're hearing things. Oh, I see my players are kneeling, raising a fist. But do they really understand it? It has to go from head knowledge to heart knowledge."

    "article_text":"By Paul Sandle LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's competition regulator said on Monday it was assessing whether a complaint about Google related to digital advertising warranted a formal competition law investigation. The complaint from Marketers for an Open Web (MOW), a coalition of technology and publishing companies, said it wanted the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) to delay the launch of Google's Privacy Sandbox technology. MOW said the technology would remove features such as login and advertising from the open web and put them under Google's control. \"We take the matters raised in the complaint very seriously, and will assess them carefully with a view to deciding whether to open a formal investigation under the Competition Act,\" the CMA said. \"If the urgency of the concerns requires us to intervene swiftly, we will also assess whether to impose interim measures to order the suspension of any suspected anti-competitive conduct pending the outcome of a full investigation.\" MOW said Google's Chrome browser and Chromium developer tools were being modified to give it greater control over how publishers and advertisers can operate. These changes are scheduled for full implementation in early 2021, MOW said. \"If Google releases this technology they will effectively own the means by which media companies, advertisers and technology businesses reach their consumers and that change will be irreversible,\" MOW director James Rosewell said. Google said the technology will allow people to receive relevant ads - helping to sustain the current advertising model - without tracking users on an individual level. Advertisers would be able to target groups of people without allowing individual identifying data to leave the browser. \"The ad-supported web is at risk if digital advertising practices don't evolve to reflect people's changing expectations around how data is collected and used,\" Google said. \"That's why Google introduced the Privacy Sandbox, an open initiative built in collaboration with the industry, to provide strong privacy for users while also supporting publishers.\" EXISTING TOOLS The CMA has already spent a year looking into digital advertising. The watchdog has said that Google and Facebook have developed unassailable market positions, with the two accounting for nearly 80% of UK's digital advertising spending of 14 billion pounds ($17 billion) in 2019. However, its investigation, which concluded in July, recommended regulatory changes rather than a market investigation. CMA Chief Executive Andrea Coscelli said in a speech in October that existing tools were \"clearly not sufficient to address\" potential harms, although they would continue to be deployed. \"Our key recommendation was that a new regulatory regime is required in the UK to ensure these markets continue to deliver benefits to consumers, businesses and the economy as a whole.\" Rosewell said regulators globally were looking at Google's dominance in search, online advertising and browsers. \"However, their efforts to mitigate this monopoly power will be in vain if Google manages to consolidate its dominance through the introduction of Privacy Sandbox prior to the regulators' recommended changes to the law being implemented,\" he said.

After crashing in March, the broader market has seen high highs and low lows, and the S&P 500 index is up 10% year to date through Friday's close. Etsy's success as an online marketplace for handmade and one-of-a-kind items hasn't gone unnoticed -- certainly not by Amazon, which tried to compete with its own Handmade service. But with great management, an improved platform, and a long lead, Etsy keeps growing. Etsy was well positioned for the pandemic, not only as a fully digital business, but with a community of makers ready to create custom masks and other pandemic paraphernalia. CEO Josh Silverman coordinated a response that spread demand among suppliers to meet increased interest in masks, resulting in millions of new customers, triple-digit sales growth for the past two quarters, and soaring earnings. Image source: Getty Images. And it's far from over. Active customers are also on the increase as Etsy moves from a niche category into the mainstream and challenges the biggest names in e-commerce. The company acquired Reverb, a marketplace for musical instruments, moving into complementary businesses and adding new ways to plump the top line. Etsy's stock has gained almost 240% over the past 12 months (based on Friday's closing price), but it fell after a great earnings report that has investors wondering about the future, and fell again on Pfizer's promising coronavirus vaccine news. While some forward progress was definitely built into its price-to-earnings ratio (P\/E), its recent dip brings it down to a relatively reasonable P\/E of 75, making now a great time to buy in. Square offers payment solutions for small and medium businesses as well as a peer-to-peer payments service called Cash App. But you probably already know that, since Cash App is the most popular peer-to-peer payments service in Alphabet's\u00a0Google Play store. Image source: Getty Images. Square, with $3 billion in revenue, is nowhere near as big as rival PayPal Holdings, which has close to $5.5 billion in revenue, and PayPal's Venmo is the most popular peer-to-peer payments service in the Apple\u00a0store. But Square is growing much faster, with 140% revenue growth. PayPal's maturity means its growth, while consistent, will be less eye-popping. Square's stock has gained about 190% over the past 12 months, but investors can expect to see a lot more upside. Going public in September 2019, just a few months before the pandemic struck,\u00a0Peloton was just in time for a stay-at-home fitness movement that lifted its sales and catapulted it into hot stock territory.\u00a0 Image source: Peloton Interactive. In the third quarter, even after fitness-minded consumers were out and about again, Peloton showed its staying power with a 92% retention rate, 137% increase in connected fitness subscriptions, 382% increase in digital subscriptions, and 232% increase in revenue. In fact, it's growing so fast that it can't keep up with demand, and there's a longer than one-month waiting list to purchase its premium video-connected bikes.\u00a0 Stock Advisor launched in February of 2002.

    "article_text":"Academy Award winning actor, Matthew McConaughey joins \u2018Influencers with Andy Serwer\u2019 to discuss social media and its impact on American society. MATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY: I just got on Instagram I think a year ago. My communication and that platform for me to share parts of myself out with have already been good for me valuably because I have a direct line of communication, and it's not through someone else's filter. It's a direct line. At the same time, it's been good for my business, you know. People check now. I didn't know this until I got on IG. Before you do certain jobs, they go-- let me check how many followers you have. Those followers matter even for business, for advertisers and things like that. What the scary part is that we have to really watch is for the first time in our lives we, especially children and millennials, are getting their entire sense of self based on something they put-- a picture or a phrase, something that they, poof, send out to the world. And they anxiously wait to see what all these strangers are going to say about it. And if the thumbs come back up, I'm going to have a great day. Look at me. I'm popular. If the thumbs come back down, I drop into a depression. Well, that's not healthy. And where's the responsibility lie? I mean, one, it lies with us parents of our children to say, hey, make sure you're not getting all-- your sense of wealth and identity and significance based on just approval or disapproval of the rest of the world because understand that there's a lot of folks out there that are putting the thumb down or writing something negative, and they didn't even read or look at what you wrote, all right? So where-- again, where are we allotting value and where are we allotting what our kids do? I always say this. Kiddos, millennials, all of us, thing you type in there, that comment, what you say, it's going to outlive you. It's going to outlive all of us, so think about it before you press Send and before you write it. And also this-- it's short money-- short money you think that to put you down raises me up. It doesn't. ANDY SERWER: We can come together as a country again, Matthew? MATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY: I know we can, but we're not going to-- here's what I think we have to also watch. We're not going to become a kumbaya. There's not going to be perfect justice across society. We're not going to have a utopia. And I think that it's irrational to think that we are. I think it's actually arrogant sometimes to think that this species-- and you look at-- we could go into the nominations, who voted what and where. We are evolving, but we're never going to be our best. We're not going to get there, and I think that's the point. If we could just do a little bit better, have a small ascension to the quality of our lives and who we are and how we treat ourselves and others in it, then there's a small ascension in our life and in society and in America. America is an aspiration, constantly chasing yet. But we've got to realize, we ain't ever going to get to yet, but that's the point. Trying to get a little bit better is as good as it gets. So join the party."

After run-ups like this, investors invariably wonder if it's too late to buy. In response, I say if Pinterest stock was only good enough to make shareholders money over the last eight months and nothing more, then it's one of the worst stocks I've ever heard of. But the truth is, Pinterest is among my favorite stocks for the long haul. Image source: Pinterest. Recently, a new social media app called Parler raced to the top spot in Apple's and Google's (from Alphabet) app stores. According to the Wall Street Journal, Parler's user base has surged to over 10 million people, most joining in recent weeks. Apparently, the trend is politically motivated. People displeased with fact-checking policies at Facebook and Twitter are looking to Parler, since it expressly won't intervene with what's said or shared on its platform. Parler doesn't yet pose a real threat to Facebook and Twitter -- that's not the point. This simply highlights the negative feelings some people have toward certain social media platforms. By contrast, Pinterest has an opportunity to be a much more positive platform for its 442 million users. In management's own words from the third-quarter letter to shareholders: \"[A]t Pinterest, we continued to focus on what we can control [...] This included giving Pinners and brands a positive place to be online during a divisive election in the United States.\" By avoiding political discussion and advertisements, Pinterest can be a calming place users escape to. This could prove to be a quasi-moat to its business long term. And it might explain why Pinterest's user base is surging like that of Parler. The company has added over 100 million new monthly active users so far in 2020. A growing user base bodes well for Pinterest. But for this to be a market-beating investment, the company must monetize those users better. In 2019, it averaged $0.95 in quarterly global average revenue per user (ARPU). As of the third quarter of 2020, ARPU was $1.03, so monetization is improving, but it needs to continue. And to that end, Pinterest already has some good options it's actively pursuing. Second, Pinterest is trying to educate businesses on how to advertise on the platform. Many already know about Facebook and Google. But when it comes to understanding what kind of return on investment can be expected on Pinterest, there's still a lot of education that needs to happen, especially in international markets. Pinterest is actively producing educational tools to increase awareness.\u00a0 Through these two initiatives, among others, Pinterest can monetize its growing user base and prove to be a market-crushing investment over the next five to 10 years. Image source: Getty Images. By asking if it's too late to buy Pinterest stock, potential investors are actually wondering what the stock is about to do right now. In other words, is it immediately going up, or should investors wait on the sidelines for a cheaper entry point? That complex question requires a more nuanced answer. Pinterest stock could absolutely go down in the short term. Rising coronavirus cases threaten to shut down global economies, which could cause a devastating spike in unemployment. Rising unemployment and locked-at-home consumers could persuade companies to temporarily forego ad spending, as was the case earlier this year. But Pinterest stock could also go up. Perhaps the coronavirus vaccine will quickly end the pandemic, boosting the economic recovery already underway, resulting in Pinterest's best year ever next year. I don't know. No one does.

It might sound unusual to have a country music icon financing medical research. But in fact, Parton has been helping save the world for decades. In parallel with her singing and songwriting career, she\u2019s also worked to create jobs, fund disaster relief and promote literacy. This week\u2019s Conundrum \u2014 which I wrote jointly with Zoe DeStories and my mother, Ellen Dickstein Kominers \u2014 is a way of saying thanks. We\u2019ve imagined a number of ways that Parton and other country stars could use their superpowers to solve big challenges, some more realistic than others. Each clue can be filled in with the name of a country song. Taking the first letters from each song title and putting them in a certain order will give you a two-word phrase that Parton could now add to her CV. That well-earned honorific is this week\u2019s answer. (For consistency, you should spell out all numbers in the song titles even if that\u2019s not the way they\u2019re listed officially.(1)) With thirteen clues, you\u2019ll have a lot of letters to unscramble. But with a little luck, Dolly Parton might even be able to help you simplify that problem. Got the rules? Then here goes: Dolly Parton says \u201cAbracadabra\u201d and moves huge rock formations with a little __. Diamond Rio facilitates a stimulus bill compromise by getting everyone to __. George Strait makes poker interesting again with an __. Dolly Parton promotes world peace with an __. Johnny Cash helps everyone at the campsite roast marshmallows by setting up a __. Martina McBride makes the world believe in love again by sending everyone Sweethearts and a __. Dolly Parton defeats Dracula with a __. Dolly Parton helps people working across time zones trick their circadian rhythms and get some shuteye with an __. Dolly Parton ends Montague-Capulet strife with the help of __. Brad Paisley helps cash-strapped sourdoughs become musicians so they can earn some __. Dolly Parton gives us our lives back by limiting the workday to __. Garth Brooks saves the world\u2019s food supply from Aesop\u2019s fox with a __. Dolly Parton makes kids\u2019 pony dreams come true, with the help of Twilight Sparkle, Rainbow Dash, and __. If you solve this Conundrum of many clues \u2014 or if you even make partial progress \u2014 please let us know at skpuzzles@bloomberg.net before midnight New York time on Friday, November 27. If you get stuck, there\u2019ll be hints announced on Twitter and in Bloomberg Opinion Today. To be counted in the solver list, please include your name with your answer. Programming note: There will be a Conundrum the Sunday after Thanksgiving, November 29. We hope you enjoy the holiday in the meantime! Previously in Kominers\u2019s Conundrums \u2026 Our tribute to Alex Trebek featured seven \u201cJeopardy!\u201d-style clues, with a wrinkle: Each had one word wrong. The goal was to solve the clues and figure out how to fix them; the corrected words hinted at the Conundrum answer, which we indicated was \u201cone of the most important game shows in history.\u201d Here are the clues with their answers (corrected words in parentheses): FAMOUS FOOTWEAR for 100: These sparkly red pumps will take you from &pizza (Oz) to Kansas. \/\/ What are the RUBY SLIPPERS? PLACES for 500: Home of the Nationals, the Manatees (Wizards), and the \u201cCaps,\u201d as well as a football team. \/\/ Where is WASHINGTON, DC?(2) AESTHETIC ARITHMETIC for 100: 28 and 496 are examples of this rare type of integer; it\u2019s a major open question whether any such numbers are hexagonal (odd). \/\/ What are PERFECT NUMBERS? \u201cSOLO\u201d ACTS for 200: When told, \u201cThere\u2019s some chance you shot first,\u201d he might answer, \u201cNever tell me the facts (odds)!\u201d \/\/ Who is HAN SOLO?(3) PLAYTIME for 100: This brick-builders\u2019 amusement park is a flagship property of Nestl\u00e9 (Merlin) Entertainments. \/\/ What is LEGOLAND? QUESTIONABLE ANSWERS for 300: This British rock band is known for hits like \u201cBaba O\u2019Riley\u201d and \u201cPinball Atkins (Wizard)\u201d \u2014 as well as for destroying equipment on stage. \/\/ Who are THE WHO?(4) GAME GEAR for 700: This device keeps track of which monsters you\u2019ve seen, and provides useful information such as \u201cMoltres (Oddish) evolves into Gloom.\u201d \/\/ What is a POK\u00c9DEX? Three of the corrected words directly or indirectly referenced wizards; three others all pointed to the word \u201codd.\u201d And the seventh was \u201cOz.\u201d Together, these suggested the answer \u201cTHE WIZARD OF ODDS\u201d \u2014 where Trebek got his start as a host. But the Conundrum wasn\u2019t quite done there. As we hinted, there was a hidden \u201cDouble Jeopardy!\u201d bonus round. To start solving that, the first thing to notice was that there was information we provided that wasn\u2019t used anywhere in the main puzzle. (If you didn\u2019t solve this part and want to practice your puzzle-solving, maybe go back to the clues now and try to figure out what that extra information was.) Every clue had not just a category name but also a point value. You could drop the zeros from the point value to get a number between 1 and 7, and then look at the corresponding letters in both the answer and the misfit word. (It was the \u201cdouble\u201d round, after all.) Doing this spelled out a hidden message: \u201cRIP ALEX\u201d, \u201c& THANKS\u201d.(5) 100 \/\/ RUBY SLIPPERS \/\/ &PIZZA 500 \/\/ WASHINGTON \/\/ MANATEES 100 \/\/ PERFECT \/\/ HEXAGONAL 200 \/\/ HAN SOLO \/\/ FACTS 100 \/\/ LEGOLAND \/\/ NESTL\u00c9 300 \/\/ THE WHO \/\/ ATKINS 700 \/\/ POK\u00c9DEX \/\/ MOLTRES This was one of our most popular Conundrums ever, with over 225 solvers, 39 of whom also solved at least half of the \u201cDouble Jeopardy!\u201d round. (And of course, we gave kudos to anyone who submitted their answers in the form of a question.) Zoz* solved (both parts) first, followed by Lazar Ilic, Elizabeth Sibert, Michael Thaler, John Owens^, Suproteem Sarkar, Spaceman Spiff, Ellen & Bill Kominers, Eric Price*, AZ*, Adam Green, Taylor Finn & Kylie Wolfe^, Stephanie Spina, Curtis Page, Lucy Smith, and Chris Olds.

(Asterisks indicate those who also solved the full \u201cDouble Jeopardy!\u201d round; carets indicate those who solved half of it.) The full solver list is available here. Several solvers suggested potential alternate \u201cDouble Jeopardy!\u201d answers: Kris Keyser pointed out that \u201cAlex Trebek\u201d himself could be the answer to the question \u201cWho was the Wizard of Odds?\u201d. Martha Moneymaker and Laura Odelius suggested the answer might be \u201cHollywood Squares,\u201d which Trebek had wanted to host but never did. Ashley Helenihi, Ellen & Bill Kominers, Kayla Langborgh & Cody Ruben and Clint Tauscher observed that the sum of the point values was precisely 2000, which is the highest point value in \u201cDouble Jeopardy!\u201d. The Bonus Round Play with this online spirograph (hat tip: Elizabeth Sibert); solve this bugbear puzzle. Self-icing tsunami cakes; election eclipse paths (hat tip: Riddler Zach Wissner-Gross); mathematicians\u2019 favorite chalk (hat tip: Ellen Dickstein Kominers). Google celebrates Mandelbrot, the \u201cfather of fractal geometry\u201d; the Animaniacs catch up on the last 20 years. \u201cMoney, Power, Education And Opportunity\u201d; Scooby Doo Jeopardy!; a Thanksgiving math mystery. And inquiring minds want to know: Why did the turkey cross the road? (1) We don't want to make you have to look up the original albums just to see whether the numbers were spelled out. And we really don't want to get into an argument about whether numbers are letters or not. (2) The \"a football team\" referenced the fact that Washington's football team is currently looking for a new name. (3) Like in \"Jeopardy!,\" the \"SOLO\" in quotation marks in the category name indicated that the answer would contain \"SOLO\". (4) A \u201cquestionable answer,\u201d indeed. Other answers in this category could've included \"What The What?!? Weekend,\" \"The Who, the What, and the When\" and \"The Why Why Family.\" (5) From the puzzle constructor's perspective, there were several other ways to guess that this might be roughly how the \"Double Jeopardy!\u201d round would proceed: First, it was notable that \"700\" is not a normal Jeopardy point score, suggesting that the \"7\"must've been significant somehow. Similarly, \"&pizza\"is a seemingly very specific choice for a word that could've been any location, suggesting that maybe the misfit words were themselves significant.

Fool.com's Healthcare and Cannabis Bureau Chief Corinne Cardina chatted with Lifesum's CEO Henrik Torstensson about the digital health and wellness space and their partnership strategy. Corinne Cardina: Partnership has been a big strategy for Lifesum. The company has developed some really impressive partnerships with big tech companies, notably Amazon recently. Can you tell us more about Amazon Halo? Henrik Torstensson: I'm very happy to be one of the nine launch partners for Amazon Halo, which is Amazon's new health device and program that is coming this fall. They're really interested in taking a very holistic approach to health and we are their nutrition partner on the lab side. Cardina: Great. What does that mean? How does that work in practice? Torstensson: With Amazon Halo, when you want to change your approach to nutrition and food, they have a part of the service called labs where we've made the content and the program that the subscribers and users of Amazon Halo are using to actually go on and change how they eat. Cardina: Okay. It's an education component? Torstensson: It's an interactive education component. You pick something you want to do and then there's this daily guidance to actually help you do that. Cardina: Awesome. That's super exciting for you all. The Amazon Halo, it harnesses artificial intelligence to inform what we know about our bodies. What excites you about artificial intelligence in the healthcare space? Torstensson: What I think is so fascinating and really promising is that there's this great amounts of data, and we collect hundreds of millions of data points every month from our 45 million users, and with artificial intelligence we are able to personalize the experience for individuals and actually dig out what we will learn from others to actually make it easier for everyone to live healthier lives. Cardina: Great. Torstensson: Get sick or get really on the preventive side, which is probably the best thing if you get it right. Cardina: Yeah, absolutely. What might you say to folks who are skeptical that tech companies will protect their most private data, their biometrics, their health information? Torstensson: I can only speak for Lifesum and we always start with users' rights and privacy. We collect the data that the user gives us to actually provide a service, and if they want us to share that with other services to make their lives better, we think that's fine, but it's not for us to go and share that data without user consent. Cardina: Great, very important. I enjoyed looking around that Lifesum social media. It looks like social media is an important component of your strategy, really educating folks on some timely wellness trends, education. I saw an explainer on intermittent fasting, which is something I've been really interested in recently as well. What do you think about social media and the role it's playing in Lifesum's success? Torstensson: To us, it's a digital service, and as eight years old, as a digital-native company with the millennial generation, it's obviously a core part of what we do and how we interact with our membership. It's important, but there are our partnerships as we discussed before. So it's really the mix of finding a great product, great social media, great partnerships, to make the magic source. Cardina: Absolutely. How do you envision the future of digital health? What trends do you think will continue to gain momentum once the coronavirus pandemic subsides? Torstensson: I think one thing that I'm really excited about, what we're doing is actually one of the AI-driven products, it's predictive tracking. By looking at everyone else that's used Lifesum and what you have done before as an individual user, we can actually predict what you're going to eat and that really creates this magical fluent experience. That level of being a daily part of a user's life is really exciting. I think that one segment of digital health that really got this pushed, which I think will stay with us and continue to grow is really telemedicine. I think that's going to stay with us because it's just more convenient for a lot of interactions with our doctors. Cardina: Yeah, absolutely. Lifesum is all about eating, right? Eating is a big part of our lives. When you're ready to make a big change in your life for your health, food has a really big part of that. How does Lifesum help users change their way of living for the better as it pertains to food, nutrition, and eating? Torstensson: We're all about food and nutrition and what we're saying is we want to improve lives through better eating; nutrition is the numbers aspect, but it's really about emotions and actually how we were brought up, our culture that impacts what and how we eat. What we do is we help users and we say it's really about the user. It's about being personalized, which way actually works for each individual. It might be intermittent fasting that you're interested in, that is something that you want to go down that road. Then we bring in the best knowledge, build a great experience, actually make that really, really easy. Cardina: Excellent. What does the interface of Lifesum look like? Is it planned menus? Is it for people to track what they're eating and look at calories and the macro breakdown? I'd love to just hear about it from a user perspective. Torstensson: It's a mix of that. We have a food tracker and you can search, you can use our barcode scanners or our image recognition to actually take a photo of what you're eating to pick that up, and then we'll give you individual feedback on that. That feedback differs depending on what your goal is, if you're trying to lose some weight or if you're trying to eat healthier or if you're trying to build muscle or gain weight, depending on if you're on intermittent fasting or high-protein or a balanced diet, actually what you want is very different feedback and that's what we built with our food rating algorithms. Then we also have recipes. We have plans that tell someone gets going. What we know is that if we look at 30 days of using Lifesum, you really moved. Even if you start out with very little understanding of nutrition and food and how what you eat impacts your health, after 30 days, you have taken an enormous step in understanding that. Cardina: Yeah. I love looking at the data on all of my different wellness apps. When I go for a run, I love to see, did I go a little bit longer, a little bit faster than the last time? I think that touch point probably makes the product really sticky so your users continue to use the app for a long period of time. They don't just forget about it and move on. Is that right? Torstensson: Yeah, absolutely. We have very loyal users. Sometimes people use it for a while. They use it to understand. We're nutrition partners of Nike, and as an example, really, if you're going to run a marathon or longer race, understanding what you eat and how you eat and how that impacts your performance is really critical. Cardina: Yeah, absolutely. Are there any other partnerships beyond Amazon Halo that Lifesum has created that you'd like to talk about? Stock Advisor launched in February of 2002. Returns as of 11\/28\/2020."

    "url":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/cloud-ai-transformation-retail-140057787.html",
    "article_text":"The tech giant\u2019s cloud division commissioned a retail survey from McKinsey & Co., and the results portray a landscape that may be fraught with challenges, but also holds major opportunities for brands and stores \u2014 if they know how and where in their business to apply intelligence. More from WWD The survey\u2019s scope covers 100 retail executives from companies with $300 million or more in revenue across North America, Asia Pacific, Europe, Middle East, Africa and Latin America. Tharp went into a bit more detail in a conversation with WWD: \u201cWe all know that the capital is locked up in the product, and merchants and marketers and everybody in these organizations is very specific on maximizing returns and engaging customers in the most effective way. What really came through in the research is really putting a number to that value,\u201d she said. The numbers are significant. The survey revealed that AI and ML could potentially drive $230 billion to $520 billion in value by 2023 for specialty retailers, including fashion, accessories, beauty and other categories. The figures are even higher for food retailers, drug stores and big box chains. When it comes to AI in retail, the conversation often centers around the flashiest, consumer-facing areas. Think chat bots, personalized product recommendations, conversational commerce, computer vision and augmented or virtual reality. These are important \u2014 increasingly so \u2014 but they are only one part of a much deeper puzzle that extends across both the front and back ends of the business, according to Google. The span is wide and includes 10 areas, including customer acquisition and retention, omni-channel commerce, merchandising, logistics, real estate and other corporate functions. Of these areas, Google Cloud found that a few segments that accounted for an overwhelming share of the potential, representing more than 75 percent. For specialty retailers, those segments are merchandising and assortment, product lifecycle management and logistics and fulfillment \u2014 with the overwhelming emphasis on merchandising and assortment. To be sure, AI and ML can help companies recognize critical patterns often missed by traditional analytics, while powering retail services and other critical features. For instance, Hanes Australasia improved product recommendations and revenue with the tech giant\u2019s Recommendations AI. Vestiaire Collective used the company\u2019s cloud translation tools to translate thousands of descriptions from six languages into English automatically, saving as much as 82 percent over its previous service. Some retail businesses may be reluctant to join forces with the e-commerce giant, which is often accused of competing with its own marketplace merchants. But the truth is that there are plenty of brands and retailers that rely on its cloud services \u2014 including Bonobos, J. Crew, Skechers, Levi\u2019s, Poshmark, Etsy and many others. Its vast retail experience, plus 20 years in AI and machine learning, gives it an informed perspective and no small amount of technical expertise. From AWS\u2019 point of view, retail in the coronavirus era is fixated on one particular area: efficiency. \u201cCloud technologies are really in the forefront now, especially in this pandemic. Retailers are looking primarily at a couple of things,\u201d Tom Litchford, head of worldwide retail at AWS, told WWD. \u201cOne, \u2018how can I basically start cutting costs?\u2019 And number two, \u2018how do I start recovering all that revenue I\u2019ve lost while my stores were closed?\u2019\u201d First and foremost, Litchford believes businesses need to accelerate their cloud migrations and modernization efforts, \u201cincluding moving stuff out of data centers and into the cloud,\u201d he said, which could bring savings of anywhere from 30 to 50 percent. As for AI and ML, he said that every retailer AWS works with has been racing to figure out how to approach it, especially during the pandemic. \u201cSpecifically from a fashion perspective, you\u2019re sitting there on sale merchandise, and you\u2019re trying to figure out how to liquidate, while at the same time, you\u2019re coming into a holiday season trying to get merchandise in for that and planning for your spring merchandise,\u201d Litchford added. \u201cThat\u2019s coming up all at the same time. It\u2019s a harsh scenario, not really knowing what\u2019s going to happen and when COVID is going to be under control and we\u2019re back to some sort of normalcy.\u201d Indeed, apart from efficiency and cost-cutting, the pursuit of deeper customer connections tends to be what drives most intelligence initiatives, regardless of platform or service provider. That has retailers pushing hard for personalization and forecasts, so they can understand their customers better. The goal, of course, is to develop stronger relationships. It\u2019s a scenario Google\u2019s Tharp sees all the time. \u201cMany merchants are so locked up, perhaps, in an Excel spreadsheet with macros,\u201d she said. \u201cThe value of bringing a broader point of view, broader data insights, into an AI and ML-based solution [is that] there\u2019s just a lot of value left to be unlocked. One of the effects is really about \u2018everything customer\u2019 \u2014 so customer personalization, customer 360.\u201d This need is not going to go away, even if COVID-19 does. The Google Cloud executive likens it to the period after 9\/11: \u201cFrom a peak perspective, we\u2019re in it. Much of this year, instead of thinking of the big picture for 2021, a lot of retailers are focused on being ready for battle stations and \u2018what do I urgently need in place?\u2019, focusing on survival and living to fight another day \u2014 in a way that many retailers had to do in the wake of 9\/11,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd so you saw this very focused period on the most critical things. \u201cBut from a bigger picture, when you think about this study, this is really about, it\u2019s never too late,\u201d she added. \u201cIt\u2019s always a good point to start this journey.\u201d Google offers that glimmer of hope, and it\u2019s not just wishful thinking. It\u2019s backed by data. Although the market has undoubtedly contracted for major parts of the apparel industry this year, the search giant found that enthusiasm for fashion is still alive and well. Searches for \u201cfashion online shopping\u201d jumped globally by over 600 percent between March through May versus the same period the previous year. And between June and August, searches for \u201cclothes shopping apps\u201d grew globally by over 200 percent, compared to the year before. In other words, the public\u2019s appetite for fashion hasn\u2019t gone anywhere. Who will be around to meet it when the restrictions lift, economies recover and people are ready again to indulge may be defined by more than just grit and resilience. It will take preparation. And intelligence \u2014 in every sense of the word."

    "article_text":"(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. and other technology companies said confidential material they provided for the U.S. government\u2019s antitrust probe of Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google should not be shared with the search giant\u2019s in-house lawyers because the information is too sensitive. In a filing Friday in federal court in Washington, Apple said it gave the U.S. Justice Department \u201ccompetitively sensitive\u201d documents and that allowing lawyers inside Google to see the information would result in \u201cmaterial harm\u201d to Apple. A similar joint filing was made by Amazon.com Inc., AT&T Inc., Microsoft Corp., Oracle Corp., Comcast Corp., Sonos Inc., Duck Duck Go Inc. and T-Mobile US Inc. Concerns about such disclosures have emerged since the government sued Google for allegedly abusing its power to thwart competition. The Justice Department and Google have clashed over the extent of access to information collected by the government before it sued. The judge overseeing the case, Amit Mehta, has yet to rule on the issue. The Justice Department has proposed allowing companies that provided information to designate their most sensitive documents as \u201chighly confidential,\u201d which would prevent access to Google\u2019s in-house lawyers, according to court papers. The U.S. argues that allowing the search giant to see the proprietary information would give Google even more power in the market than it already has. Google pays Apple billions of dollars a year to make its search engine the default browser option on iPhones and other products, according to analyst estimates. In its court filing, the iPhone maker said the documents at issue relate to its negotiations with Google and other search engines and Apple\u2019s internal deliberations about those discussions. \u201cDisclosure of this information to Google would directly implicate future business dealings between Apple and Google, provide Google with a substantial advantage over Apple in negotiations, and potentially disadvantage competitor search engines that negotiate with Apple and other software providers,\u201d it said.

    "url":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/3-stocks-continuing-shine-overvalued-190007617.html",
    "article_text":"While the pandemic has not had the same effect on all players in the extremely diverse Internet \u2013 Services industry, it\u2019s now clear that those players that were adversely impacted are also climbing out of the blues. However, since this is a capital intensive industry with high fixed cost of operation and the fairly constant need to expand capacity, it\u2019s harder to recover from any drop in demand. Because of the increased digitization and greater reliance on digital services over the past few months, investors have bid up most stocks. So despite the growth prospects, most stocks look expensive. Our picks are The Trade Desk, Alphabet and Dropbox. About The Industry Internet - Services companies are primarily those that rely on huge software and hardware infrastructure, referred to as their properties, to deliver various services to consumers. Therefore, consumers can avail the services by accessing these properties with their personal connected devices from almost anywhere in the world. Companies in the sector generally operate two models: an ad based model where the service is offered free and an ad free model where they charge for the service.\u00a0 Alphabet (GOOGL), Facebook (FB), Baidu (BIDU) and Akamai (AKAM) are some of the larger players in the space while Dropbox (DBX), Etsy (ETSY), Shopify (SHOP), ANGI Homeservices (ANGI), Uber (UBER), Lyft (LYFT) and Trivago (TRVG) are some of the emerging players. COVID has brought mixed fortune for the industry because the wide range of services provided by this group has meant that some services were used more while others were used less. So things that helped people stay home for work, business or pleasure (as provided by companies like Etsy, Shopify, 21Vianet and CooTek) were positively affected, while those that depended on people moving out of their homes (as provided by companies like Uber and Lyft) or those that depended on strangers entering homes (as provided by ANGI Homeservices) were hit negatively. The situation is unlikely to change in the next few months given the new wave of infections and the time lag before vaccines reach the general public. Factors Shaping The Industry Traffic acquisition is one of the most important drivers of revenue, so companies invest in advertising or building communities that can draw more users to their online properties and get them to spend more time there, much like a store owner would try to keep a prospective buyer within the store. Some large players, including those providing infrastructure services, grow by tying up with other such large players for access to their customers. Since the personal touch is absent in an online store, many rely on cookies and other technologies to track users, collect data on them and profile them in order to better understand their needs. As these companies have grown over time, some of them have collected such a wealth of information on their users that the data itself is now helping them build artificial intelligence (AI) to lower cost and generate new technologies and services. As a result, ad-based services are no longer considered free in some parts of the world and the EU in particular has framed a complex law in GDPR that requires service providers to acquire explicit permission from users before collecting their data. The installed base of connected devices continues to grow beyond PCs and smartphones to IoT, automotive and more, creating additional opportunities for targeting. The ownership of multiple devices automatically drives people to use these services more as they increasingly automate routine chores. While not all businesses are built on the same scale or have the same customer reach, the scope for growth is huge. For companies that are already pursuing research in AI, the prospects are even brighter. Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Uncertain Prospects  The Zacks Internet - Services industry is housed within the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector. It carries a Zacks Industry Rank #205, which places it among the bottom 19% of more than 250 Zacks industries. The group\u2019s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates near-term challenges.Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1. The industry\u2019s positioning in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is because of its relatively slow recovery from the pandemic. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, we see that estimates have been rising since July although they still lag the year-ago number. So analysts appear cautious about the group\u2019s earnings growth potential.  The industry\u2019s earnings estimate for the current year is down 10.2% from November 2019. The average earnings estimate for 2021 is down 12.4%. Before we present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let\u2019s take a look at the industry\u2019s recent stock-market performance and valuation picture. Industry Leads on Stock Market Performance While slightly lagging the broader Zacks Computer and Technology Sector through most of the past year, the Internet Services industry remains well ahead of the S&P 500 index as continued revenue growth (net of seasonal fluctuations) was hurt by the pandemic, re-igniting concerns related to the increasing cost of operation\/expansion and rising debt levels. The industry has soared 33.4% over this period compared to the S&P 500 index\u2019s 15.3% gain and broader sector\u2019s 35.2% gain. One-Year Price Performance Industry\u2019s Current Valuation On the basis of forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P\/E) ratio, which is a commonly used multiple for valuing technology companies, we see that the industry is currently trading at\u00a0a 29.75X multiple, which is close to its median value of 29.36X. However, the multiple is above the S&P 500\u2019s 22.41X and the sector\u2019s 26.81X, suggesting overvaluation. Forward 12 Month Price-to-Earnings (P\/E) Ratio \u00a0 3 Stocks With Promise The Trade Desk Inc. (TTD): The company provides a technology platform for ad buyers to create, manage and optimize data-driven digital advertising campaigns involving display, video, audio, native and social media across PCs, mobile devices and connected TV. TTD is benefiting from the huge user shift to digital channels and limited budgets of advertisers. As advertisers look to maximize their ROI, as the data, platforms and volume of users surge, tools like the ones TTD offers are just what they need. This is driving results. After a solid beat of over 159% in the last quarter, the current year EPS estimate of this Zacks Rank #2 stock increased 48.3% from $3.17 to $4.70. The shares are up 235.1% over the past year and up 458.2% from their March lows. Price and Consensus: TTD Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL): Alphabet is primarily known for its search-engine although it has in the last few years branched into many other areas including cloud computing, mobile software and hardware, autonomous vehicles, ad-based video and music streaming, and healthcare. The company is clearly firing on all cylinders as it is particularly well positioned to benefit from an at-home economy. With everyone operating from home, they are using YouTube more, companies are relying on Google Cloud more and advertisers are rushing to both search and YouTube because of the swelling traffic and the company\u2019s AI-based tools. Google Play is of course a beneficiary as well. So after solidly beating earnings estimates by 43.9%, the EPS estimate for the current year increased 13.5% from $44.92 to $50.97. The shares of this #2-ranked company are up 35.3% over the past year and up 66.8% from their March lows. Price and Consensus: GOOGL Dropbox, Inc. (DBX): Dropbox offers a platform which enables users to store and share files, photos, videos, songs and spreadsheets. Dropbox is focused on providing tools for distributed teams to function cohesively. Being a Virtual First company, the pandemic actually played to its strengths, pushing people to use its products and services more. With both individual and corporate investments adjusting to a more distributed remote-working paradigm, there\u2019s unlikely to be a reverse trend in the foreseeable future. Therefore, this company looks really good. The company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 36.8% in the last quarter, after which current year estimates increased 14.3% from 77 cents to 88 cents. The shares are up 2.2% over the past year and up 20.6% from their March lows. Price and Consensus: DBX 5 Stocks Set to Double Each was hand-picked by a Zacks expert as the #1 favorite stock to gain +100% or more in 2020. Each comes from a different sector and has unique qualities and catalysts that could fuel exceptional growth. Most of the stocks in this report are flying under Wall Street radar, which provides a great opportunity to get in on the ground floor. Today, See These 5 Potential Home Runs >>"

    "headline":"Twitter Stock Has Been an Eyesore, But Fleets Could Change That",
    "url":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/twitter-stock-eyesore-fleets-could-183635530.html",
    "article_text":"Source: Worawee Meepian \/ Shutterstock.com As a result, Twitter\u2019s stock has been the eyesore in an otherwise surging social media space. But Twitter may have just solved its \u201cmoney\u201d problem. The company\u2019s newly announced disappearing-content feature Fleets injects much-needed, full-screen visual inventory onto the Twitter platform, which can be subsequently populated with engaging, high-conversion, visual-heavy ads. If that happens, Twitter\u2019s sluggish revenue growth trends could accelerate in the coming quarters, and set the stage for TWTR to break out. Twitter\u2019s a great platform. I use it all the time. So do a lot of my friends and colleagues. It\u2019s an essential and very important part of the fabric of the global digital ecosystem. Despite its global ubiquity, though, Twitter has forever struggled to turn strong engagement into sustained strong ad revenue growth. Why? Because digital ads and text-heavy platforms like Twitter don\u2019t mix well. Imagine you own a shoe brand. Would you want to promote your product through Twitter in a quarter-page ad that sandwiched between two word-heavy tweets? Or would you rather promote your product through a full-screen, visual Instagram Stores or YouTube ad that\u2019s mixed in with other visually engaging posts? The answer is obviously the latter, because a picture paints a thousand words and context matters. The result is that platforms like Instagram Stories and YouTube are stealing ad dollars from Twitter, which has led to sluggish revenue growth for several years, and ultimately weighed on TWTR stock. But Twitter may have finally found an answer to this fundamental problem. Twitter just announced a new disappearing-content feature called Fleets. Fleets appear at the top of your home feed on Twitter in the same way that Instagram Stories or Facebook Stories appear on those feeds. They are disappearing, full-screen content posts that look very much like Stories content, with a visual media focus. Fleets are a big deal for TWTR stock for two reasons: First, they should boost engagement. It\u2019s no secret that digital engagement is shifting rapidly toward visual content. All the trendy social media apps these days are dominated by full-screen visuals. TikTok \u2026 Instagram \u2026 Pinterest \u2026 YouTube \u2026 etc. Fleets puts Twitter on that same playing field. Second, they should boost advertiser demand. Now that Twitter has inventory for full-screen visual content, they can launch full-screen visual ads with brands. That should attract more advertisers to the platform. Then, as those ads show high conversion rates (as they should), more and more ad dollars will come flowing into the Twitter ecosystem. In this sense, Twitter Fleets could actually end up saving Twitter \u2014 and spark a big breakout in TWTR stock. From a pure valuation perspective, at 10-times trailing sales, TWTR is as cheap as it gets in the social media space today. Facebook sports a similar multiple, and Pinterest and Snap trade near 30-times sales. Twitter\u2019s cheap valuation has made sense for so long because of the lack of financial firepower at the business. But that cheap valuation will start to look like a bargain if Twitter acquires more financial firepower thanks to Fleets and a potential subscriber business that could launch in 2021. So, if Twitter\u2019s revenue growth rates do start to accelerate meaningfully in 2021, Twitter\u2019s stock will benefit from both multiple expansion and higher moving forward earnings estimates. That\u2019s a winning recipe for big gains. Twitter has been an eyesore in the red-hot social media space for so long, it\u2019s hard to think of it differently. But that narrative could change soon thanks to Fleets and a potential new subscriber business. If so, Twitter stock could go from zero to hero.

    "url":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/facebook-and-twitter-should-move-to-a-subscription-based-models-scott-galloway-175349945.html",
    "article_text":"\u201cWhen you have an ad-based model, it goes to the lowest common denominator, and rage is a fantastic way to get engagement and serve more Nissan and opioid-induced constipation ads,\u201d Galloway said. \u201cSocial media is nicotine, it's addictive, but it's not necessarily bad for you. The thing that gives you cancer, the tobacco here, is the ad model, because it leads to algorithms that want to put people in a left or right positioning and then enrage them.\u201d For his part, Galloway said the platform is yet another symptom of the divisions of the business model created by social media platforms. \u201cI think we need something to skim the waste, and the toxicity off of the pool of information here and dispose of it somewhere and if Parler ends up being the septic tank for the misinformation and conspiracy theories more power to them,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn't have the scale, the requisite scale of a Facebook or a Google, to be in the ad-supported business, but it does have so many influencers \u2014 whether it's from media, the economy, or celebrities \u2014 they need to better monetize it through subscriptions,\u201d Galloway said. Galloway suggests a scenario where the Twitter users with the most followers are charged the highest premiums. \u201cSay 0 to 10,000 followers are free. 10 to 100,000 are $10 or $50 a month. And anyone above a million followers pays $1,000 to $10,000 a month. There\u2019s tremendous value when you have that type of influence and followership on the platform,\u201d Galloway said. The marketing professor said Apple\u2019s moves to up its subscription services is a good predictor of his hypothesis. \u201cApple hasn\u2019t increased its earnings, tangibly, nor its top line revenues, but its stock has doubled over the last 18 months. Why? Because they\u2019ve moved from 9% of revenues that are subscriptions to 24%,\u201d Galloway said. Another way Twitter could additionally grow its revenue is through a series of verticals, according to Galloway. Even a dip in revenue, Galloway said, would be a worthwhile tradeoff for the company\u2019s long-term future. \u201cYou could see its revenues decline 10% or 20%, but you could see the stock double,\u201d he said, if the company were willing to exit the advertising industrial complex."

In its most recent quarter, Google brought in $37 billion in ad revenue, accounting for almost the entirety of the company\u2019s revenue overall. As part of the deals with the French publishers, all will also be featured in News Showcase, a new product that Google revealed in October, limited to Germany and Brazil and now France. Future countries to be part of the product include Canada, the U.K. and Australia. When and if it will come to the U.S. is unclear, but leaders of major American publishers, including The New York Times, Washington Post and Wall Street Journal, have all noted at one time or another their gripes with going wholly unpaid for Google Search and News, beyond the traffic they get from the engine.  Showcase is set to pay involved publishers via licensing deals for content they either create or package specifically for the platform optimized for mobile users. It is starting out as a mobile-only feature of panel-style news that offers bullet points of information and promotes related articles, but the plan is to eventually work it into Google Search and News. Video, audio and briefing components are set to come down the line as well. \u201cThis approach is distinct from our other news products,\u201d Google ceo Sundar Pichai said in October, \u201cbecause it leans on the editorial choices individual publishers make about which stories to show readers and how to present them.\u201d"

    "article_text":"While these stories are told to everyone to show how America gives everyone equal opportunity, and success only depends on hard work, this theme falls afoul of the fallacy known as the survivorship bias. What survivorship bias means is that we tend to focus on the success stories i.e. those who made it rather than those who did not because of a lack of visibility. This is despite the fact that the vast majority comprises of those who have not made it, and that there are unique conditions that have led to success in these cases, including a huge amount of luck, which has no logical explanation behind it. Pixabay\/Public Domain The wealth distribution in America is incredible for all the wrong reasons. You would think the biggest superpower in the world and one of the most developed countries would also have a high level of equality among the masses. The truth is a complete 180 turn, with wealth inequality in the US being incredibly high. The wealthiest 1% of Americans hold an amazing 40% of all wealth. The bottom 90% hold less than 25% of the total wealth. 25% of the total families in US don't even have $10,000. And this isn't a common theme throughout history, it has actually increased significantly over time. In 1989, the bottom 90% had a third of all wealth, now down to a quarter. The wealth of the top 1% was 30% then, still a lot, but at least 10% below what it is now. 84% of the families in the US have less wealth than the mean for the country. Why that is, I will explain later on in the methodology section. In fact, this high concentration of wealth and relative inequality is why many propose a strict progressive system for taxation, to increase the tax on ultra high net worth individuals, which has of course been strongly opposed since these are the men and women who directly or indirectly, exert a huge amount of influence and control.

    "article_text":"\u201cStays of longer than a few days started increasing as work-from-home became work-from-any-home on Airbnb. We believe that the lines between travel and living are blurring, and the global pandemic has accelerated the ability to live anywhere. Our platform has proven adaptable to serve these new ways of traveling,\u201d the prospectus states. With major companies like Google, Sony Music, RBS, and Group Nine Media pushing back a return-to-office until at least 2021, and tech leaders like Twitter, Facebook, Shopify, and Slack establishing permanent remote work indefinitely, COVID-19\u2019s long-term impact on expectations for the workforce has the possibility of normalizing work-from-anywhere for the white collar world. Yahoo Finance DC correspondent Jessica Smith and her husband Travis Perry, a certified financial planner, gave up their apartment at the end of September and have been road tripping and working at various Airbnbs across the country. Smith says after crunching the numbers, she and her husband were able to find several Airbnb properties that would allow more space and more peace of mind and actually save them money in the process. \u201cWe paid less for Airbnbs than we would have for rent. We made that a rule and found Airbnbs that fit the budget. We did buy a car, but that was something we were thinking about and saving for anyway. Since we aren\u2019t paying for cable, the gym, parking, internet, utilities, or renter\u2019s insurance, it gives us a little cushion for more takeout,\u201d she said. Still, not everybody has the freedom to work remotely. Those who do work remotely, for now, may one day have to return to the office, especially once a coronavirus vaccine is available. Indeed, Glassdoor senior economist Daniel Zhao says remote work will not be a permanent norm. While the number of permanently remote job openings was up 61% year over year, according to Zhao, he noted that the vast majority of workers are tied to a physical space. In somewhat of an ironic twist, Airbnb lists its own work-from-anywhere policy as a potential downside for the business. Read more:"

    "article_text":"Chicago, IL \u2013 November 20, 2020 \u2013 Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Alphabet Inc. GOOGL, Microsoft Corp. MSFT, Texas Instruments Inc. TXN, NVIDIA Corp. NVDA and Skyworks Solutions Inc. SWKS. The year 2020 is likely to remain coronavirus-stricken as the availability of a vaccine by this year-end and its global implementation looks unlikely. Despite this gloomy picture, Wall Street has recovered impressively from the pandemic-led bear market. At present, all the three major stock indexes \u2014 the Dow, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite \u2014 are in positive territory year to date. In fact, the Dow and the S&P 500 posted fresh all-time highs this week. Notably, the predominant force behind Wall Street's impressive recovery was the technology sector. However, during the last two and half months, the technology sector lost its pace of growth due to market participants' concern over the sector's overvaluation and the possibility of the availability of a COVID-19 vaccine that shifted investors' preference from growth-oriented technology stocks to cyclical reopening stocks. \u00a0 Consequently, several large-cap technology stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank are currently available at lucrative valuation. At this stage, investment in these stocks is likely to be prudent. The technology sector pulled down the overall market in September and October after being the predominant driver of the impressive showing from April to August. It was technology that had helped Wall Street to exit a coronavirus-induced short bear market and form a new bull market. However, on the due course of the market's V-shaped recovery from its trough on Mar 23, technology stocks got overvalued, as stated by many financial experts. Moreover, positive late-stage clinical trial data released by a few pharmaceutical and biotech companies\u00a0 for their potential coronavirus vaccines significantly strengthened investors' confidence in reopening stocks. Year to date, the technology sector has jumped 33.3% compared with 10.4% of the benchmark S&P 500 Index. However, in the past three months, the technology sector has gained 4.6% as against 5.3% of the benchmark. In the past month, technology dropped 1.1% compared with a decline of 1.2% of the S&P 500 Index. In the long term, the technology sector will remain the predominant force to drive the market. We must not forget that the growing demand for hi-tech superior products has been a catalyst for the sector in an otherwise tough environment. A series of breakthroughs in 5G wireless network, cloud computing, predictive analysis, AI, self-driving vehicles, digital personal assistants and IoT, have boosted the overall space. As social distancing is keeping near and dear ones away, people, especially the citizens of the emerging and less-developed countries, are reaching out more than ever with smartphones, tablets or notebooks. The thrust for digitization is likely to come from two sides. Individuals who enjoy immense benefits of digital platforms are less likely to go back to their old habits. The new way of connecting has opened up a new world for them. Also, business entities will be more interested in cloud computing, automation and artificial intelligence to establish smooth supply chain systems. \u00a0 We have narrowed down our search to five technology stocks based on four criteria. First, we have selected tech behemoths (market capital > $20 billion) as these companies have a well-established business model and strong brand value. Second, these stocks have strong short-term and long-term (3-5 years) growth potential.

    "url":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/graphic-french-italian-economies-hurt-104744896.html",
    "article_text":"By Leigh Thomas PARIS, Nov 20 (Reuters) - Lockdowns in France and Italy are weighing down public mobility more than in other European countries, according to high- frequency data compiled by Reuters that suggest the two economies will take a correspondingly bigger hit. Data ranging from use of Apple maps apps to Google's user location history are proving vital tools for governments, central bankers and investors trying to gauge the economic impact of restrictions, weeks in advance of conventional indicators like consumer spending or industrial output. The French official stats agency INSEE has found that the data Google can collect on how much time people spend at home is particularly closely correlated with how much an economy has slowed during the crisis. And while the impact is nowhere near as pronounced as during the first set of more draconian lockdowns this year, that data suggest that people in France, Italy and Britain are currently seeing the biggest increases in the time spent at home. Paris and Milan have also seen the sharpest reductions in traffic congestion, and Italy the steepest decline in public transport usage, ahead of the Netherlands, UK and France. Germany's \"lockdown lite\" imposed on Nov. 2 has left indicators of activity holding up much better than in countries that have gone for tougher measures, such as closing all but essential shops and services. Spain was among the hardest hit in the first wave, but its activity also appears be resisting better after it imposed a six-month state of emergency at the end of October, giving its regions legal backing to implement curfews and restrict travel. Overall, countries are seeing less of a blow to activity than in the first wave of lockdowns after governments calibrated restrictions this time to limit the economic fallout. For comparison, mobility is around the same levels as seen in May. In a case in point, France has seen a sharp fall in activity since the government was one of the first in Europe to put the country back under a full lockdown on Oct. 30. However, the drop is not as dire as in March and April with the new French lockdown allowing considerably more flexibility for companies and schools left open. Other real-time indicators like electricity consumption also show little impact from the new wave of restrictions across Europe, although colder weather is also fuelling demand heading into the winter. Meanwhile, governments have largely spared their industrial sectors under the new restrictions, as the service sector bears the brunt of the fallout. The German official stats agency's truck toll mileage index https:\/\/www.destatis.de\/EN\/Service\/EXDAT\/Datensaetze\/truck-toll-mileage.html, which it says is a bellwether for industrial production in Europe's biggest economy, is currently running at levels on par with those seen before the coronavirus crisis broke out. While overall economic activity has cooled once again heading into the year end, some traditional indicators of economic health such as unemployment and bankruptcy filings are still not flashing red. But that is likely to be because of government support measures like subsidised furlough schemes and state-guaranteed bank loans to companies are keeping consumers and businesses afloat - at least for now.

    "article_text":"Companies that launch robotaxi services in California will be able to charge for and offer shared driverless rides as long as they can navigate a new government approval process that some in the industry argues adds unnecessary bureaucracy that could delay deployments by more than two years. The California Public Utilities Commission approved Thursday two new programs to allow permitted companies to provide and charge for shared rides in autonomous vehicles. The nascent automated vehicle technology industry has lobbied the CPUC for months to consider a rule change that would allow for operators to charge a fare and offer shared rides in driverless vehicles. The decision was widely cheered with some cautionary caveats. Companies won't be able to start charging for rides tomorrow. Instead, these potential robotaxi operators will have to receive the proper permits from the CPUC and the California Department of Motor Vehicles as well as meet several reporting requirements. Companies can apply offer driverless service with or without shared rides. Participating companies also have to submit a safety plan and quarterly reports to the CPUC with aggregated and anonymized information about the pickup and drop-off locations for individual trips, the availability and volume of wheelchair accessible rides and service levels to disadvantaged communities. Companies also have to supply data such as the fuel type used by the vehicles, miles traveled and passenger miles traveled. \"As it currently stands, the process to acquire both Commission and DMV deployment permits may extend beyond two years \u2014 far too long considering the urgency of the need,\" Cruise wrote in its submitted comments. \u00a0"

    "article_text":"Robotaxi operators will be allowed to charge fares for driverless rides in California under a plan approved by the state Public Utilities Commission on Thursday. But don't expect to hail a robotaxi right away: The CPUC fare plan lays down a lengthy government approval process for each robotaxi operator that could take months or years. Driverless robotaxis have begun operating small-scale commercial services in Arizona, Las Vegas, Shanghai, Singapore and elsewhere. The CPUC ruling would put California on that list. The question is when. Waymo already is running a pilot program in Silicon Valley that ferries Waymo employees from building to building in robotaxis but doesn't charge fares. General Motors' Cruise said it would offer commercial robotaxi rides in San Francisco as soon as the CPUC allowed. \"We are pleased that the CPUC has voted today to approve a state regulatory framework for commercial autonomous ride-hailing,\" Waymo said in a prepared statement. \"This long-awaited agency action will allow Waymo to bring our fully autonomous Waymo One ride-hailing service to our home state over time.\" How much time? In comments and proposals submitted before the CPUC vote, Waymo and other companies took issue with the approval process the CPUC laid out. Waymo already operates a commercial robotaxi service in Arizona. Although states such as Arizona and Nevada have encouraged robotaxi development with streamlined approval processes, companies that want to operate in California must deal separately with two agencies, the CPUC and the Department of Motor Vehicles. The CPUC ruling requires a would-be robotaxi company to receive approval from the DMV before it begins the application process with the CPUC through what's called a \"Tier 3 Advice Letter\" process, the process used to approve rates for energy utilities and water and sewer operations. The process can take months to years. In comments submitted prior to the CPUC vote, several robotaxi companies suggested that the DMV and CPUC processes should occur simultaneously, and that the CPUC handle robotaxi approvals the way it handles ride-hailing services, rather than through the more onerous and time-consuming Tier 3 method. Cruise even submitted a revised order striking out what it saw as red tape. But the CPUC made no major alterations. The vote for the ruling was unanimous. CPUC Commissioner Genevieve Shiroma, who spearheaded the ruling, said the process could be revisited in the future. \"I don't know if I'm terribly cautious by nature,\" she said. But \"we are talking about a new program that will be a paradigm-changing program for us.\""

    "article_text":"\u201cHe should be fired,\u201d Galloway said. \u201cI mean this is a big company with thousands of employees that plays a big role in the discourse of society, and about 1 p.m. every day he peaces out and he goes to another firm.\u201d Twitter and Elliot eventually came to an agreement that left Dorsey in place, and gave Elliot and Silver Lake, which also joined in the scrum, seats on Twitter\u2019s board. Galloway, an investor in Twitter, however, still isn\u2019t satisfied with Dorsey\u2019s divided attention. \u201cThe fact that he's a part-time...renders him totally incapable of providing the attention and leadership that this company needs,\u201d Galloway said. He added that Twitter has failed to innovate and \u201cscarily\u201d looks like it did in 2015, the year Dorsey started his most recent stint as CEO of Twitter. Twitter declined when reached for comment on Galloway\u2019s criticism. \u201cI honestly didn\u2019t think we\u2019d land on Jack when we started unless he could step away from Square. But ultimately, we decided it was worth it,\u201d Williams wrote, explaining that Dorsey\u2019s ties to Twitter inform \u201ca depth of vision and authenticity of voice.\u201d Dorsey\u2019s firing is not the only change at Twitter that Galloway\u2019s calling for. As for systemic changes, Galloway says that Twitter needs to transition away from an ad-based revenue business, and instead institute a subscription model. \u201cThere isn't a single platform that has the influence of Twitter that isn't trading at 20 to 30 times the market capitalization,\u201d he said. Facebook\u2019s market cap as of Thursday was $777 billion, while Google\u2019s sat at over a trillion and Twitter\u2019s was just under $35 billion. While the company may not have the scale to take on the likes of Facebook and Google in advertising, Galloway says the number of big-name influencers ranging from celebrities to experts in the fields of finance and media make it a ripe opportunity for subscriptions. \u201cSay 7,000 to 10,000 followers are free, 10,000 to 100,000 is $50 a month, and anyone above a million followers pays $1,000 to $10,000 per month. There\u2019s tremendous value when you have that type of influence and followership on the platform,\u201d Galloway said. Such a move, Galloway admitted, could cause Twitter\u2019s revenue to decline by 10% to 20%, but, he added, the company\u2019s stock price would double. \u201cWe\u2019ll see if they come through with it, but that\u2019s why I\u2019m a shareholder,\u201d Galloway said. \u201cI think this company has tremendous value to be unlocked via the exiting of the advertising industrial complex and moving to a subscription model.\u201d More from Dan:"

More from WWD The executive died from injuries sustained in a Connecticut house fire, according to press reports citing a family lawyer. Delivering happiness was the executive\u2019s mantra. As he built Zappos, Hsieh\u2019s chief goal was to redefine the meaning of company culture. From the beginning, his singular vision set the company apart as a pioneer in footwear e-commerce and corporate America. \u201cThe world has lost a tremendous visionary and an incredible human being,\u201d said Zappos chief executive officer Kedar Deshpande in a note to employees on Friday. \u201cWe recognize that not only have we lost our inspiring former leader, but many of you have also lost a mentor and a friend. Tony played such an integral part in helping create the thriving Zappos business we have today, along with his passion for helping to support and drive our company culture.\u201d Hsieh, who retired and stepped down from the Zappos helm this past summer, told WWD\u2019s sister publication Footwear News last year how much the company had evolved since it was founded two decades ago. Then, after another call to the Nordstrom department store in San Francisco, Fred Mossler eventually jumped on board, and together the new team set out to change the industry. Zappos was a pioneer in free shipping and returns, and it didn\u2019t take long for the concept to take hold as e-commerce took off. While many market watchers celebrated the marriage, they also speculated that the new parent could impose its own culture on the new division. But true to the initial agreement, Zappos has continued to operate separately from Amazon, maintaining its own leadership team and unique character. Several years into the Amazon partnership, Hsieh launched The Downtown Project, an initiative to revitalize downtown Las Vegas. In 2015, Zappos did away with managers in favor of a form of self-organization called holacracy. In a blog post at the time, Hsieh wrote, \u201cLike all the bold steps we\u2019ve done in the past, it feels a little scary, but it also feels like exactly the type of thing that only a company such as Zappos would dare to attempt at this scale.\u201d Since its early days, Zappos has functioned as something of an incubator for testing theories about corporate culture and productivity \u2014 long before those ideas became the buzzwords they are today. Much of the credit for that lies with Hsieh. \u201cHis spirit will forever be a part of Zappos, and we will continue to honor his memory by dedicating ourselves to continuing the work he was so passionate about,\u201d Deshpande wrote in the note to employees. \u201cOur thoughts remain with him and his loved ones. Zappos is a family, and we will continue to hold Tony close in our hearts.\u201d"

    "article_text":"Here are three factors leading to improved profitability for its online business. Image source: Walmart. Third-party sales were by far the biggest factor impacting Walmart's online operating profits in the third quarter. Management said sales from its third-party marketplace increased by a three-digit percentage, considerably faster than its overall sales. Walmart is also working to copy one of Amazon's most successful third-party services by fulfilling orders for its marketplace merchants. The company introduced Walmart Fulfillment Services in February, and management sees it as an integral part of the e-commerce strategy going forward. A robust fulfillment service similar to Amazon's could attract more merchants to its marketplace, further growing third-party sales. Another key component to Walmart's push toward profitability is its online advertising business. While it's still small, digital advertising also has a very high profit margin for Walmart. It's worth noting, however, that Walmart's online ad sales may cannibalize its in-store advertising in the future. If the shift to online sales is permanent, as management suggests, and people return to their previous shopping habits as restaurants and other smaller retailers reopen, in-store traffic will drop, decreasing the value of in-store advertisements. Last quarter, Walmart's total transactions in the U.S. fell 14.2%, suggesting lower foot traffic as shoppers consolidate their trips. Another factor that's worth pointing out is Walmart's ability to grow its online sales without a massive build-out in fulfillment centers. Walmart has opened just three e-commerce fulfillment centers in 2020, according to MWPVL International. It has just three more in the works, which would bring its total to 28. Instead of using more warehouses, Walmart is leaning on its existing stores for fulfillment. It fulfilled orders from 2,500 stores in the fiscal second quarter but pulled back in the latest period as it was able to open more fulfillment center capacity. The ability to use its stores will cut down the overhead that comes with running a huge number of warehouses. That said, Walmart has hired extra workers to help pick products from the shelves in stores, but it's also using artificial intelligence to help make them more productive. In the long run, Walmart will need to build out additional warehouse capacity if it wants to fulfill orders for third-party merchants. And as online sales continue to grow, it'll need more resources dedicated to online orders. So, limiting fulfillment center build-outs now is pushing it toward profitability, but it's not necessarily best for the long-term goals of Walmart.com. Walmart may move more aggressively with new fulfillment centers as its high-margin marketplace and advertising businesses keep expanding. That will allow it to operate closer to breakeven as it continues to grow. Still, it has a long way to go, and not being as aggressive now could hold it back in the long run.\u00a0"

    "article_text":"2U is in the midst of a massive transformation of its business. Four years ago, it was totally reliant on its graduate programs for revenue growth. This required the company to invest up to $10 million to develop each program with a partner university. As a quality program takes time to develop, it could be a year or more before 2U would see revenue from students. Once the completed online program is launched, it is branded under the university name, and tuition is set by the university as well.\u00a0 A few years ago, the company realized this operating model with heavy upfront investments wasn't sustainable long term. It has significantly reduced the number of high-end programs it was launching and reduced the investment for the ones it did create. Another key part of this transition was two acquisitions: Get Smarter (a short course online development company) and Trilogy (an IT boot camp provider). These investments are focused on shorter learning programs that are quicker to develop and provide a faster return. They also provide 2U's more than 75 university partners a means to expand into new educational non-degree tracks. These could be an attractive alternative for adults wishing to enhance their skills without the cost and time burden of a graduate degree. 2U Metrics Q3 2016 Q3 2017 Q3 2018 Q3 2019 Q3 2020 Total revenue $52.0 million $70.3 million $107.0 million $153.8 million $201.1 million Grad degree revenue $52.0 million $65.9 million $89.7 million $103.4 million $122.0 million Alternative credential revenue N\/A $4.4 million $17.3 million $50.4 million $79.1 million Alternative credential % of total N\/A 6.3% 16.2% 32.8% 39.3% Data source: Company earnings reports. Table by author. You can see in the table above that over the last four years, the top line has almost quadrupled, thanks to a combination of more university partners, more program offerings, and more students. In its most recent quarter, organic revenue growth accelerated to 31% year over year, up from 18% in the second quarter and 17% in the prior-year period. This strength was primarily attributed to its alternative credential segment which surged 57%.

Data from company earnings report. Table by author. Even before the coronavirus, the value of an ever-increasing cost of higher education has been put into question. Tuition costs since 1998 have more than doubled. With COVID-19 driving the on-campus experience online, many students are wondering if an expensive degree is really worth it. For the fall 2020 semester, enrollment for freshman college students is down an unprecedented 16% nationally, according to data from the National Student Clearinghouse Research Center. This deep drop in enrollment is putting colleges that were financially stretched in an even more tenuous financial situation. Image source: Getty Images. But there are even more headwinds for universities. Tech companies are getting in the game with alternative tools and educational opportunities. Amazon provides a platform for educators who want to publish educational material. Google, a subsidiary of Alphabet, provides tools to students and teachers while also offering Google-branded certificates for high-demand jobs like an IT support technician. IBM has its own skills academy, with state-of-the-art technological content provided for free.\u00a0 The coronavirus has accelerated the popularity of college-alternative programs. These less costly, highly-specific offerings will likely continue to attract students even after the pandemic is over.\u00a0 The coronavirus has heightened the acceptance of non-traditional educational paths. With large, deep-pocketed new entrants in the industry, it remains to be seen what long-term impact this increased competition could have. And the company is still heavily dependent on its graduate segment, where its partners control the pricing of programs. If tuition is priced too high, the program may struggle to attract students (resulting in decreased revenue share for 2U). If tuition is cut to make the program a more attractive value, that also reduces 2U's revenue share. This is an especially critical decision now that higher education faces more uncertainty than ever. Management is making all the right moves, but in the end, this company is a service provider, tightly tied to the success of its university partners. I suggest investors stay on the sidelines for now."

    "article_text":"Image source: Getty Images. Let's imagine that Amazon copied Apple's dividend strategy. Reserving 19.2% of its free cash flow for dividend checks, Amazon would spend $4.7 billion a year to finance a quarterly payout of roughly $2.36 per share. That may sound like a lot, but it works out to an effective yield of just 0.3%, since Amazon's stock is trading at nearly $3,200 per share. Copying Microsoft's deeper commitment to dividends would result in Amazon earmarking 31.5% of its cash flows for dividend purposes. That's $7.8 billion, enough for a quarterly dividend of $3.87 per share. The effective yield would rise to 0.5%. Better, but still not terribly impressive. Image source: Getty Images. The thought exercise above is interesting but not very realistic. Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos is well-known for his intense focus on maximum growth. Every day at Amazon is supposed to feel like \"Day One\" at a rising start-up business. Even a small dividend budget would take resources away from that central idea. The day might come where Amazon runs out of high-octane growth prospects and is forced to shift down into the slow but inevitable decline that Bezos describes. That day is not today or any day in the foreseeable future. I would be shocked to see Amazon initiating a dividend policy within the next decade or two. If you're looking for a massive cash machine in the tech sector that can power a solid dividend payout for decades to come, feel free to consider Apple or Microsoft. Amazon won't join that club anytime soon."

    "article_text":"What a difference a pandemic makes. That's the one my kid plays, by the way. Hours and hours a day, adopting, training, and raising exotic pets ranging from dogs to monkeys to unicorns, and then trading them to other players for even more exotic finds. But there are many, many more games than just these few examples, and the offerings are growing all the time as Roblox enables developers to create new games and offer them for play on its site. Simple as the concepts may seem, these games are extremely popular with kids -- a veritable cultural phenomenon. Roblox advertises that the \"majority of our users are under the age of 13\" and, according to CNN, \"about 75% of American children ages 9 through 12 play Roblox regularly with friends.\"\u00a0 If you think that sounds like a good business to be in, you're not wrong. According to Roblox's S-1 filing with the SEC, just released, the company averages 31.1 million daily average users (DAUs), generating $589 million in revenue in the first nine months of 2020. (Games are free to play, but players can elect to purchase in-game currency called \"Robux\" to spend on in-game improvements such as special items and avatar costumes -- that's where Roblox's revenue come from.)\u00a0 Prior to COVID-19, Roblox was growing strongly -- DAUs were up 47% in 2019 and revenue was up 56% -- and growth accelerated as more people stayed home during the pandemic. Year-to-date, DAUs have grown 82%, and revenue is up 68%. From one perspective, however, this rapid growth during the pandemic has come at a cost. With more new users playing Roblox for free these days, or at least spending less on Robux, losses mounted to $203 million in the year's first nine months. That's the bad news. Or put another way: Revenue year-to-date is $589 million. Free cash flow is $293 million. So for every dollar of revenue Roblox takes in, it creates $0.50 in cold hard cash. And yet, even if Roblox is more profitable than any of these other tech companies, it does not necessarily mean that you should buy the Roblox IPO. Precisely how expensive Roblox will end up being is unclear. The S-1 filing it gave us last week was long on words but short on numbers when it came to (a) how many shares it intends to sell at its IPO, (b) what price it wants per share, (c) how many shares it will end up with after the IPO, and, accordingly, (d) the price of the entire company."

    "article_text":"For nearly all of us, getting to play for a professional sports team or writing a best-selling book or winning an Academy Award is just a pipe dream -- it's not likely to happen. But there are still some wonderful life achievements that are within our grasp -- such as retiring a millionaire. Given sufficient time and effective saving, most of us can become millionaires, and we can get there simply by investing in the overall stock market -- perhaps via a low-fee S&P 500 index fund. Your portfolio might grow extra-fast, though, if you include some companies that are growing briskly (and continue to do so). Image source: Getty Images. Before naming any promising companies, here's a look at just what it takes to amass a million dollars. It all depends on three factors: Clearly, the longer your investments can grow, the bigger your nest egg will become. That's why it's best to start early -- even in your 20s -- as that might even permit you to retire early. Finally, how much you invest also matters a lot. The table below shows how much you might amass saving different sums regularly over various periods: Growing at 8% for $10,000 invested annually $15,000 invested annually $20,000 invested annually 5 years $63,359 $95,039 $126,718 10 years $156,455 $234,683 $312,910 15 years $293,243 $439,865 $586,486 20 years $494,229 $741,344 $988,458 25 years $789,544 $1,184,316 $1,579,088 30 years $1,223,459 $1,835,189 $2,446,918 Data source: Calculations by author. For example, it's firing on all cylinders during the pandemic, with net sales in the third quarter surging 37% over year-ago levels to $96 billion, while net income tripled. The company has added a lot more workers and is planning to add 100,000 more permanent workers, who will receive at least the company's minimum wage of $15 per hour. While many, if not most, people associate it just with its online marketplace offerings, one of its biggest cash cows these days is its cloud-computing platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS), which grew 29% to $11.6 billion in the third quarter, and boasts\u00a0a 33% market share in its industry. Image source: Getty Images. These three companies are all doing well, and are positioned to keep doing well for a long time. They're worth adding to your investment watch list, and perhaps even worth buying into now, if you see them as undervalued and you expect to hang on for the long term."

    "article_text":"Dow Jones futures will not begin trading until Sunday evening, along with S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq futures. The stock market rally had a strong week, with the Dow Jones and Nasdaq composite both hitting record highs. But there is a disconnect between the robust, secure action in the major indexes vs. some more speculative names and high bullish sentiment. All four are important in their own right, but they also have a broader stock market impact. Zoom Video earnings and guidance on Monday night, and ZM stock reaction, will be key as looming coronavirus vaccines loom over stay-at-home stocks. Dow Jones futures will reopen at 6 p.m. ET on Sunday. So will S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq 100 futures. Coronavirus cases worldwide reached 62.41 million. Covid-19 deaths topped 1.45 million. Confirmed coronavirus cases in the U.S. have hit 13.56 million, with deaths above 271,000. However, actual U.S. Covid-19 infections reached 52.9 million at the end of September and could be nearly 100 million now, according to a model developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The model assumes most coronavirus cases are mild or asymptomatic and are never tested. Los Angeles County announced a new stay-at-home order Friday as coronavirus cases soar in the nation's most populous county. The three-week order, starting Monday, bans most gatherings and limits capacity in retail stores and other non-essential businesses to 20% occupancy. The stock market rally had a strong week, with the Dow Jones and Nasdaq composite both hitting record highs and the S&P 500 index on the cusp of all-time levels. Zoom Video stock jumped 7.3% last week after an 8.9% rally in the prior week. On Friday, shares broke a rather-steep downtrend, but closing just below its 50-day line. A move above the 50-day would offer a buying opportunity, but not until after Zoom Video earnings Monday night. CrowdStrike stock climbed 3.5% last week to 150.83. It's close to an official 154 buy point. It already triggered an early entry on Nov. 19, when CRWD stock rebounded from its 50-day line and broke above its 50-day line. It cleared another entry at 144.39. CrowdStrike earnings are due Wednesday night, along with Zscaler and Okta, which are also above early entries. Nio is likely to report monthly delivery figures late next week. For the past few months, Nio has released monthly figures on the second or third day of the following month. Production and deliveries have been rising dramatically. That's also true for Xpeng Motors and Li Auto, thought starting from a lower base. BYD is among the very largest EV makers in China. Investors are betting the Nio growth will remain strong. Nio stock has surged 247% since its late October breakout and a whopping 1,551% since May 22. Xpeng and Li Auto stock are up 327% and 243%, respectively, from their late summer IPO prices. In early 2021, Tesla will begin deliveries of the made-in-China Model Y, with the VW ID.4 coming out at about the same time. EV production in China is set to skyrocket. Tesla stock is up 17.8% from its 10-day line. That's not extreme. Also, it comes shortly after a powerful breakout, when hot stocks often can be bolt from moving averages without raising concerns for a while. Apple stock rising would provide a further lift to the market rally. It would be a good sign for Apple iPhone chipmakers such as Qorvo and Qualcomm stock. Both offer tight entries. If Apple stock and other megacaps gained momentum, that would fuel further market gains and bullish sentiment, perhaps hastening a pullback. So in the current climate, perhaps the stock market rally needs lukewarm action from tech giants to keep from overheating. As always, you should analyze your stocks, with a special emphasis on your winners. How extended are they from moving averages. You may want to consider partial profits on stocks that have been going nearly vertical for some time. There aren't a lot of good-looking setups right now, with some of the promising-looking stocks ready to report earnings, like CrowdStrike stock. So cast a wide net for your watchlists.

    "article_text":"Among all the other reasons the year 2020 was one for the record books, investors will remember it as the year of the electric vehicle (EV) stock. It is hard to believe the near-term surge is sustainable, and at some point a lot of these stocks might need time off the road to recharge. But the potential of electrification in the world's largest automotive market is real, and there are going to be some great long-term investments to come of out of this supertrend. Image source: Getty Images. Li is selling one vehicle right now, a family-sized SUV named the Li One. In its registration statement to go public, the company argues that the SUV segment is quickly becoming the largest part of the Chinese automotive market, which is one reason why the company plans to roll out four additional SUVs in the coming years. The Li One also comes with an onboard gasoline generator that supplements the battery and acts as a range extender, giving customers peace of mind when recharging stations aren't available. That's an important selling point in China, where EV sales are booming but charging infrastructure, especially outside of major urban areas, is yet to catch up. As exciting as the potential is, we should note there is clearly a frenzy around EV stocks and the current valuations might not be sustainable in the near term. Li Auto shares are up 142% in just four months since the company went public. Its market cap, at $34 billion, is in line with that of Ford Motor Company despite having one-tenth of the revenue. But even if there could be some near-term turbulence, Li is set up well to be a long-term survivor. It's attacking an attractive niche in the Chinese market, and it has a product out there that seems to be selling well. The company's founder and CEO, Xiang Li, has experience with U.S. public markets through his last start-up, Autohome. And as the owner of 21% of Li Auto's shares, his interests are tied to those of shareholders. There's a lot of risk involved in EV stocks, but also a lot of potential. Li Auto isn't a \"set it and forget it\" style investment and isn't well suited for those with a conservative bent. But a few shares now could be a gift that keeps giving for years to come if the company's business goes to plan. Consider:\u00a0 We all know how Tesla's stock has performed over the last couple of years. That doesn't necessarily mean that NIO's stock will follow the same path, of course. But NIO is the homegrown favorite -- that counts for something in China -- and after a near-bankruptcy experience early in 2020, it's now flush with cash and scrambling to increase production. NIO plans to launch two new electric sedans in 2021, including a production version of the handsome ET7 show car. Image source: NIO. Yes, NIO's stock isn't cheap. But neither was Tesla's at $100, and we all know how that played out. NIO's stock might or might not follow the same path, but the company's future looks quite bright from here.\u00a0 That's pedal to the metal growth, folks. And XPeng isn't just moving metal -- it's breaking new ground in automotive technology, too. Such technological leadership should help XPeng secure a strong position in the Chinese automotive market, where EV sales are expected to grow 43% annually over the next five years. Indeed, by the end of that period -- by 2025 -- investment bank J.P. Morgan projects that 7% of all electric cars sold in the Middle Kingdom will be XPeng electric cars."

    "article_text":"(Bloomberg) -- When the world\u2019s most-famous electric car maker finally joins the S&P 500, it will be bitter-sweet for investors with about $11 trillion in funds tied to the gauge. Their benchmark-hugging bets get some Elon Musk magic at last, but they pay seven-times last year\u2019s price for the privilege. Given the chance, how many would have added Tesla Inc. to their index exposure in January? Or even June, when the shares had merely doubled? Customization is at the heart of a red-hot investing strategy driving two of the biggest deals in asset management this year. Known as direct indexing, it blurs the line between stock-picking and benchmark-following and now commands about $300 billion after its popularity surged in recent years. The idea is simple: Instead of buying shares in a fund that slavishly holds all the companies in an index, investors buy those stocks directly. The index exposure is broadly the same, but the investors are no longer wedded to it. They can make tweaks -- like adding a skyrocketing automaker well ahead of the S&P 500, for example. \u201cThe Tesla issue of the last few months is probably highlighting for the first time to a lot of people that the S&P is not the largest 500 companies,\u201d said Elya Schwartzman, founder of ES Investment Consulting LLC. With direct indexing, \u201cyou can just create your own index and say, look I want the largest 600 companies by U.S. market capitalization,\u201d he added. Direct indexing is a modern twist on separately managed accounts, which have been around for years and are used to build bespoke portfolios for wealthy individuals. The age of zero-commission trading and growing use of fractional shares means similar strategies can now be deployed for smaller investors. It remains a nascent part of the asset-management industry, but the buzz is building. Morgan Stanley\u2019s $7 billion purchase of Eaton Vance Corp. is all about direct indexing -- the latter\u2019s Parametric Portfolio Associates is the largest provider in the field. BlackRock Inc. this week announced a $1 billion takeover of Aperio, a creator of tailored index strategies. The ESG Effect As dramatic as the Tesla example is, the real selling point for direct indexing may turn out to be the ability to remove companies from a portfolio\u2019s exposure rather than add them. In the drive toward investments that meet environmental, social and governance criteria -- which also happens to be one of the tailwinds for Tesla -- huge disagreements exist over exactly what qualifies. Direct indexing allows an investor to make adjustments according to his or her own views, and remove companies not up to scratch. Read more: Record Flows Pour Into ESG Funds as Their \u2018Wokeness\u2019 Is Debated \u201cHaving this additional need for customization is really where we get involved,\u201d said Jeff Brown, director of institutional portfolio management for Parametric. \u201cIf I want market exposure, there are quick easy ways to get it through an ETF, but if I want to customize in any way, shape or form that doesn\u2019t exist in the ETF space, that\u2019s where we can step in to fill that gap.\u201d That kind of flexibility comes with a price, however. While fierce competition among brokers and asset managers has driven down trading costs across the industry -- boosting direct-indexing products in the process -- they still typically charge about 0.15%-0.35%. That\u2019s less than an active mutual fund, but three to five times the price of some equity exchange-traded funds. The fee for the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI) is just 0.03%, for example. \u201cIf direct indexing is going to experience another leg of growth, it\u2019s going have to fan out further to the mass affluent market,\u201d said Ben Johnson, Morningstar\u2019s global director of ETF research. \u201cIt\u2019s going to have to be achievable at a lower entry point.\u201d Until recently, direct indexing tended to be the preserve of high net-worth individuals, according to Tom O\u2019Shea, director of managed accounts at Cerulli Associates. The investing approach offers a huge tax benefit because investors have more losses which they can use to offset gains. ETFs famously do this as well, but direct indexing lets an investor utilize it at an individual stock level, which is estimated to add between 1 and 2 percentage points a year to returns. Making the most of that traditionally required a large number of securities owned outright, putting it out of reach of the average investor. But improving technology and fractional shares offered by brokerages like Charles Schwab Corp. and Robinhood are changing things. \u201cYou\u2019re able to do the same thing with a smaller portfolio,\u201d said O\u2019Shea. \u201cYou can have 200 securities, but you don\u2019t have to have as much money.\u201d Deal Maker A recent study from Cerulli found that 67% of asset-management firms believe direct indexing presents the most-immediate opportunity to manage for both tax and ESG factors, so it\u2019s no surprise to see big names making moves in the industry. The world\u2019s largest asset-manager, BlackRock, said in its third-quarter earnings call that it plans to invest heavily in its separately managed account business. The Aperio purchase will bring its assets in that area to more than $160 billion, the company said. Alongside that and Morgan Stanley\u2019s deal for Eaton Vance, Charles Schwab acquired a firm called Motif this year that offers direct indexing. Schwab CEO Walt Bettinger II has said the strategy will play an important role in the future of the company. Yet there remains plenty of skepticism that growth can meaningfully accelerate. Even customizing to include the surging Tesla ahead of the S&P 500 can\u2019t beat the pure cost-efficiency of an ETF, according to Morgan Barna, an analyst for Bloomberg Intelligence. VTI, which includes Tesla, has only delivered fractionally better performance this year than State Street\u2019s SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust. Meanwhile, for all the hype, the ESG investing phenomenon remains in its infancy. That could be one reason why industry leader Parametric\u2019s direct-indexing inflows total only $15 billion for the past year, while inflows to the ETF business at BlackRock -- the largest issuer in the space -- total $126 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. \u201cThe incremental return would have to be much higher from the sum total of your custom choices to make it worth it,\u201d said Barna. \u201cPeople who felt really strongly either bought Tesla directly outside their index exposure\u201d or bought a broader ETF, where the carmaker was included, she said. \u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P."

We know this because online investing app Robinhood has added millions of new members in 2020, and the average age of its user base is only 31. Image source: Getty Images. Image source: American Airlines. The company's poor financial flexibility was only magnified by the COVID-19 pandemic. With air traffic well below where it stood when the year began, and no clear time frame as to when people will again take to the skies, this high-capital-input, low-margin industry is hanging on by thread and producing massive losses in the process. This industry simply isn't capable of navigating its way through extended economic declines. Image source: Getty Images. Yet unlike Tesla, which doesn't have a proven, time-tested business model, and American Airlines, whose business model is disrupted with even the slightest economic headwind, Intel has demonstrated the ability to remain very profitable in adverse economic conditions. Intel is investing heavily in its future, with the company expecting demand to increase dramatically from its higher-margin data center segment in the years to come. Even the memory and programmable solutions divisions offer decent long-term growth prospects."

    "article_text":"2U is in the midst of a massive transformation of its business. Four years ago, it was totally reliant on its graduate programs for revenue growth. This required the company to invest up to $10 million to develop each program with a partner university. As a quality program takes time to develop, it could be a year or more before 2U would see revenue from students. Once the completed online program is launched, it is branded under the university name, and tuition is set by the university as well.\u00a0 A few years ago, the company realized this operating model with heavy upfront investments wasn't sustainable long term. It has significantly reduced the number of high-end programs it was launching and reduced the investment for the ones it did create. Another key part of this transition was two acquisitions: Get Smarter (a short course online development company) and Trilogy (an IT boot camp provider). These investments are focused on shorter learning programs that are quicker to develop and provide a faster return. They also provide 2U's more than 75 university partners a means to expand into new educational non-degree tracks. These could be an attractive alternative for adults wishing to enhance their skills without the cost and time burden of a graduate degree. 2U Metrics Q3 2016 Q3 2017 Q3 2018 Q3 2019 Q3 2020 Total revenue $52.0 million $70.3 million $107.0 million $153.8 million $201.1 million Grad degree revenue $52.0 million $65.9 million $89.7 million $103.4 million $122.0 million Alternative credential revenue N\/A $4.4 million $17.3 million $50.4 million $79.1 million Alternative credential % of total N\/A 6.3% 16.2% 32.8% 39.3% Data source: Company earnings reports. Table by author. You can see in the table above that over the last four years, the top line has almost quadrupled, thanks to a combination of more university partners, more program offerings, and more students. In its most recent quarter, organic revenue growth accelerated to 31% year over year, up from 18% in the second quarter and 17% in the prior-year period. This strength was primarily attributed to its alternative credential segment which surged 57%. Key quarterly metrics Q3 2020 Q3 2019 YOY change Revenue $201.1 million $153.8 million 30.7% Loss from operations ($45.9 million) ($135.0 million) N\/A Graduate program segment profitability 8.0% 1.2% +6.8 percentage points Alternative credential segment profitability (7.6%) (23.7%) +16.1 percentage points Cash and cash equivalents $481.3 million $154.1 million 212.3% Long-term debt $268.2 million $245.9 million 9.1% Net cash used in operating activities* ($6.9 million) ($85.7 million) N\/A *For the first three quarters of 2020 and 2019, respectively. Data from company earnings report. Table by author. Even before the coronavirus, the value of an ever-increasing cost of higher education has been put into question. Tuition costs since 1998 have more than doubled. With COVID-19 driving the on-campus experience online, many students are wondering if an expensive degree is really worth it. For the fall 2020 semester, enrollment for freshman college students is down an unprecedented 16% nationally, according to data from the National Student Clearinghouse Research Center. This deep drop in enrollment is putting colleges that were financially stretched in an even more tenuous financial situation. Image source: Getty Images. But there are even more headwinds for universities. Tech companies are getting in the game with alternative tools and educational opportunities. Amazon provides a platform for educators who want to publish educational material. Google, a subsidiary of Alphabet, provides tools to students and teachers while also offering Google-branded certificates for high-demand jobs like an IT support technician. IBM has its own skills academy, with state-of-the-art technological content provided for free.\u00a0 The coronavirus has accelerated the popularity of college-alternative programs. These less costly, highly-specific offerings will likely continue to attract students even after the pandemic is over.\u00a0 The coronavirus has heightened the acceptance of non-traditional educational paths. With large, deep-pocketed new entrants in the industry, it remains to be seen what long-term impact this increased competition could have. And the company is still heavily dependent on its graduate segment, where its partners control the pricing of programs. If tuition is priced too high, the program may struggle to attract students (resulting in decreased revenue share for 2U). If tuition is cut to make the program a more attractive value, that also reduces 2U's revenue share. This is an especially critical decision now that higher education faces more uncertainty than ever. Management is making all the right moves, but in the end, this company is a service provider, tightly tied to the success of its university partners. I suggest investors stay on the sidelines for now."

    "article_text":"That was a humbling blow for eBay, the world's first online auction platform for person-to-person transactions. It also explains why Shopify stock has soared more than 3,700% over the past five years. During that same period, eBay stock rose 76% and Amazon stock advanced 375%. Image source: Getty Images. Investors might be reluctant to buy Shopify stock right now, since it trades at over 290 times forward earnings. Meanwhile, eBay stock trades for 14 times forward earnings, which might make it look tempting as a value play. Nevertheless, it's smarter to pay a premium for Shopify than a deep discount for eBay, for three simple reasons. eBay's platform was once considered revolutionary. But today, it faces stiff competition from Amazon's third-party sellers, Etsy, and other similar marketplaces. Social media platforms like Pinterest and Facebook's Instagram are also integrating online purchases into their sponsored posts. Today, Shopify's services are considered disruptive. Instead of providing a centralized marketplace, Shopify's e-commerce tools help over a million merchants set up online stores, process payments, manage marketing campaigns, fulfill orders, and access other services.\u00a0 Shopify's decentralized approach enables merchants to expand online without diluting their identity, and it's easy to scale as a business grows. By contrast, merchants usually need to buy promoted listings to stand out in eBay's crowded marketplace. eBay shrank its business over the past five years. It spun off PayPal in 2015, shut down its fixed-price subsidiary Half.com in 2017, sold its online tickets platform StubHub this February, and plans to sell its online classifieds platform by the first quarter of 2021. eBay also reduced its marketing spending last year. The goal was to boost its profit and take rate -- the percentage of each sale it retains as revenue -- instead of maximizing gross merchandise volume (GMV). Its prioritization of profit over growth, along with its dividends and buybacks, strongly suggest that eBay is a mature tech company with limited growth prospects. Image source: ebay. Shopify has expanded significantly since its IPO in 2015. It acquired the digital consulting and product development firm Boltmade in 2016, the drop-shipping platform Oberlo in 2017, and the\u00a0warehouse automation company 6 River Systems last year. The company has partnered with Amazon to let merchants sell products on Amazon from their Shopify stores. It has added similar integrations with Facebook, Alphabet's Google, Snap's Snapchat, and\u00a0ByteDance's TikTok. It also beefed up its premium Shopify Plus tier for larger merchants. Shopify has also expanded its own payments platform, Shopify Payments, which processed nearly half of its GMV last quarter. It launched its own fulfillment network last year. Finally, it offers additional services via its own app store for online stores. All those aggressive moves indicate that Shopify is still expanding. It's eager to reinvest its cash into itself instead of divesting businesses and cutting costs to protect its bottom line. eBay's revenue rose just 1% last year as its GMV dipped 5%. It blamed that sluggish growth on the reduction of its marketing expenses and higher internet sales taxes in several U.S. states. Its adjusted net income rose just 5%, but big buybacks boosted its earnings per share 22%. This year, eBay expects its revenue to rise 19%-20% after excluding its divested businesses and currency headwinds. Adjusted EPS is on track to grow 18%-20%. Last year, Shopify's revenue rose 47% and its GMV surged 49%, but its adjusted EPS fell 30% as it integrated 6 River Systems into its new fulfillment network. However, analysts expect pandemic-related tailwinds to boost its revenue 81% this year, while adjusted EPS could jump more than tenfold. Next year, analysts expect Shopify's revenue and earnings to rise 32% and 2%, respectively. Investors should expect Shopify to continue generating high double-digit sales growth, but its earnings growth could remain unpredictable due to the ongoing investments in its ecosystem. The e-commerce market is rapidly evolving, and it arguably favors disruptive players like Shopify instead of legacy marketplaces like eBay. Shopify lets merchants build their own online brands and optionally link them to Amazon and social networks. eBay wants to trap them in a walled garden filled with low-priced competitors. Investors seem to believe Shopify's vision for the future justifies its premium valuation, while eBay deserves a lower valuation. Shopify stock will likely remain volatile, but it should keep attracting more bulls than eBay."

    "article_text":"Most people have used PayPal at least once. The payment processing company and peer-to-peer payments service is the dominant player in online payments, which means it was perfectly poised to handle the pandemic and come out on top. I must get an email every single day from another company that's teaming up with PayPal to provide easier payment options. The company has millions of partners in addition to clients. Total payment volume reached a record in the third quarter, increasing 36% as the economy moved online. Revenue also surged 25%. Image source: Getty Images. Shifting shopping trends have made PayPal's sweet spot the new normal. That's great news for shareholders. Adobe Analytics is predicting that instead of Cyber Week this year, November and December are going to be Cyber Months. It's forecasting $189 billion in holiday e-commerce sales, a 33% increase over the prior year. Even when the pandemic comes to an end, digital shopping is not going anywhere.\u00a0\u00a0 PayPal has also done a great job of getting into new businesses. It has acquired various companies to keep it growing in new directions, such as Venmo's popular peer-to-peer payment app and Honey, a price comparison feature.\u00a0 PayPal stock is up 95% year to date. Between its original business and innovative approach to payments, it should continue to rise in the future. Nike is such a dominant brand that it has gone beyond its activewear niche to become the leading U.S. apparel company, with $37.4 billion in sales during fiscal 2020. While it was certainly hurt by the pandemic -- sales declined 38% in the fourth fiscal quarter, which ended on May 31 -- it's also benefiting from the shift to casual wear that intensified during COVID-19. Image source: Nike. Nike flexed its digital muscle over the past few months as shoppers went online, and the company's investments in direct-to-consumer sales became a lifesaver. Sales through Nike's e-commerce business grew 83% in the first quarter of fiscal 2021, and digital accounted for 30% of total sales. Don't worry about Nike's future prospects, either. The company keeps churning out new products and strengthening its community of Nike fans. \"In this dynamic environment, no one can match our pace of launching innovative product and our Brand's deep connection to consumers,\" CEO John Donahoe said in the company's earnings report. \"These strengths, coupled with our digital acceleration, are unlocking NIKE's long-term market potential.\" Nike stock is trading at 79 times trailing-12-month earnings, which is a hefty valuation. But business is improving, and with its strong management, focus on product development, and digital prowess, investors can expect Nike to deliver high gains. Amazon's takeover of retail has been nothing short of spectacular. Expanding from books to practically every product in existence, the company has grown to become the second-largest U.S. company by revenue, right behind rival Walmart.\u00a0 Image source: Getty Images. Amazon has been the go-to shopping destination during the pandemic. Net sales grew 37% last quarter, as Amazon maintained its dominance of e-commerce in the U.S. Profitability grew as well, as earnings almost tripled year over year, reaching $6.3 billion. The online leader has been trying to get into storefronts for many years, specifically grocery: the main spending category for American consumers. It's making progress with its Go and Fresh stores, which feature cashierless technology. It's still working with pilot programs and has a long way to go until consumers fully embrace the concept, but Amazon has the power to keep going and make it work. It's also considering offering the technology to other retailers, giving it more ways to produce revenue efficiently. The e-commerce king branched out into cloud computing over a decade ago with Amazon Web Services, which powers many companies' web offerings. It grew 29% in the third quarter and contributed 12% of sales."

Furthermore, the company saved on sales expenses due to the pandemic, as its .NEXT conference went virtual and it shifted marketing resources to digital channels. As a result, its adjusted loss per share narrowed from $0.71 to $0.44. This topped the analyst consensus, which called for a per-share loss of $0.57.  However, one question more than any other will determine the stock's fate. Image source: Getty Images. Nutanix's bona fides in hyperconverged infrastructure (HCI) -- or the combination of storage, computing, and networking into one function -- are hard to doubt. It's considered a leader in HCI by both Gartner\u00a0and Forrester. It also has a net promoter score of 90, indicating that its customers are overwhelmingly pleased with the product and recommend it to their peers. Nutanix continues to spend aggressively on research and development. Last quarter, 43% of its revenue went to R&D. Moreover, new products like its database management suite Nutanix Era helped drive ACV from new products up 87%. \"This partnership substantially evolves our company strategy, enabling us to provide solutions that deliver seamless application, data, and license mobility, including a singular experience of management across all clouds,\" Pandey explained on Nutanix's earnings call. \"This is a major competitive advantage, as we become the foremost infrastructure software company with bring-your-own-license approach to help our customers in the hybrid computing journey.\" With the Azure partnership, Nutanix looks ideally positioned for adoption of the hybrid cloud, or tools that allow enterprises to shift seamlessly between public and private clouds.

I definitely see where you're going with that. Scott Helfstein: Similarly across all these areas, another one is online retail and I imagine we'll want to jump into some of the names there, but we saw e-commerce as a percentage total retail sales go from 11%to 16%, and new numbers should be out at some point this week. But to give everybody context, it took 10 years to go from 5% to 11%. It took a decade to reach 11% penetration. Ten years. So for all the people who think that Amazon is taking over everything, all of e-commerce is still only 16% of the pie. That doesn't suggest to me that all of a sudden, it's going to go back to 11. There's a whole lot more that it's going to capture and so it's just going to expand, not recede. Cardina: Definitely. So that we can get to all four, I'm just going to kind of speed through these digital consumers. Let's start with Amazon. Amazon stock is up 1,700% in ten years.

    "article_text":"Shorting is an investing concept that isn't well understood by many people, especially those who are new to the stock market. But we've got you covered. In this Nov. 17\u00a0Fool Live video, Fool.com contributors Matt Frankel, CFP, and Jason Hall break down what shorting is, how it works, and what investors need to know about the risks before considering it.\u00a0 Matt Frankel: We're going to start with short selling. I'll give you a quick rundown of what short selling means, and then we'll talk about why it's used and how to do it. I'll punt to Jason for that part. Short selling essentially means that it's a way to bet against the stock. Short selling means that you are literally borrowing shares of stock from your broker and selling them to other investors hoping that they go down, and then you could buy them back at a cheaper price and return them to your broker. If I want to bet against, say, Apple at $120 a share, I could borrow 10 shares of it from my broker, sell it to an investor at $120 a share so I get $1,200. My hope is that Apple goes down. If Apple goes down to $100 and I could buy back those 10 shares at $100 a share and return them to my broker, I've taken in $1,200 from completing the short sale, I can buy those shares back for $1,000, and that $200 difference is my profit. Sounds great, right? Jason, why do people sell stock short? Jason Hall: There's a couple of reasons. Number 1, I want to say that I think short selling is an important part of a healthy market. I think it's a reasonable way to invest. I know a lot of us, we see things on the boards, some Foolish stocks a lot of times get targeted by short sellers and then we get mad about it, and we immediately go to yelling and talking about these bad people and this bad thing they're doing. But I think in general, it's a healthy part of the market. The reason why people do it, and it's something that different Foolish portfolio services have offered, is because it's a way to extract income and profit. The bottom line is that if you see a company that you feel strongly in some reason, or your analysis has led you to believe that the price that investors are willing to pay today is not what investors are going to be willing to pay at some point in the near future, or you truly see some fundamental flaw with the business that's going to erode value and create opportunity, then you may decide to short that stock. Again, like I said, I think it can be a reasonable way to make money. But there's more to it because you also, in addition to the risks which we'll talk about, there's borrowing costs. When you're borrowing shares from somebody, they want something in return. Your broker wants a little piece of the action. So there's costs and interest and that sort of thing because you start taking on margin to short. Matt Frankel: We'll find out Jason's thoughts on margin in just a few minutes. I'll give you a hint; that's going to be the fun part of the show. Spoiler alert. But like you said, there's a few reasons people sell short, just might think the stocks too expensive? Let's just say that I think Tesla was too expensive. Jason Hall: I thought that when I was a Tesla shareholder. Matt Frankel: Let's just say that we think Tesla's too expensive. We would borrow shares, sell them short, and hope to buy them back cheaper. Another reason people sell short is to hedge against their other positions. A lot of people I know buy a short position in the overall S&P 500, for example. They have a portfolio of growth stocks and things like that, but then if the market goes the opposite way and just crashes like it did in March, then that serves as like a backstop and they can limit their losses in that sense. Jason Hall: You can almost treat it like insurance. Buying \"puts\" is another option. It's another thing that can be treated like a kind of insurance. Matt Frankel: Yeah, put options, it's a shorting alternative, I guess I'd call it. It has its benefits, but the mechanics of option trading are for another show for another day. Jason Hall: That's not a 10-minute segment. Matt Frankel: No, it's not. That's a good way to hedge. I've bought S&P puts to edge against market corrections and stuff like that in the past. Jason Hall: You can short an S&P instrument is your point, the same way they create some sort of a hedge. Matt Frankel: Sure, to create a hedge. That's another key point, that shorting doesn't have to be an individual company. You could just short the market, in other words. But shorting, there is a cautionary aspect of it that newer investors need to know before they do it. I like using Tesla as the example because I call it an unshortable stock, especially for newer investors, no matter how expensive you think it is. I mean, Tesla's what, 450 a share right now? Let's say that you think its intrinsic value is 20 bucks. I don't care. Don't short Tesla. The reason you don't short a stock that's volatile like that is because your losses are unlimited when you short. I mentioned my Apple example earlier where I'd say I'd borrow shares, sell them at 120, hope they go down. If Apple goes up to 200, I now have to buy the shares back at $200 a share and I've lost a lot of money. With some of these high-flying tech stocks, there is no real upper limit to how high they can get. Jason Hall: I think story stocks in general creates this additional layer of risk. Really, the best way to describe it is it's so much harder to predict what's going to happen. Sure, one could say, well, everything is a guessing game in the short term, and to a certain extent it is, right? Matt Frankel: Right. I was the guy who called Amazon expensive at $300 a share. People bring that up all the time so I might as well call myself out on it. But let's say I had shorted Amazon at $300 a share. It's now worth $3,000 a share, or even a little bit more. Jason Hall: 3,148 and change. Matt Frankel: Right. So your losses are essentially unlimited when it comes to shorting.\u00a0 Jason Hall: Here's the best way I figured out to describe what shorting really is. It is entirely the inverse of going long in every way, including the risks and the returns, which are inverted, plus fees that you have to pay to actually do the action. So the most you can make is a stock going to zero where you make all of your money less the fees that you had to pay to short. The most you can lose is tied to your ability to continue to watch the stock price go higher before either your broker forces you to close that short position or you realize that you just need to walk away and soak up a large loss."

In addition to selling goods itself, it allows third-party sellers to sell goods on its website. Its business thus mirrors that pioneered by Amazon.com, which went public in the U.S. in 1997. Before making its initial public offering debut, though, Ozon filed an F-1\/A filing with the SEC, laying out its business, its prospects, and its financials for potential investors to take a look. And what do we find in that filing? Let's begin with the basics. However, Ozon is growing -- possibly by taking business from even smaller players. In a market where e-commerce sales grew 51% year-over-year in the first half of 2020, Ozon's year-to-date sales grew 70%. 8,100 sellers use Ozon to sell to customers numbering either 51 million (those who have downloaded its shopping app), 41 million (those who have ever shopped on Ozon), or 11.4 million (\"active buyers\" who have used the service within the past year).\u00a0 About 51% of Ozon's gross merchandise volume, or GMV, are sales directly from Ozon to consumers. 45% of GMV is high-margin sales from third parties to consumers conducted on Ozon's Marketplace. And yet this hasn't yet turned Ozon into a profitable operation. Although sales are growing strongly, and on pace to hit 102 billion Russian rubles this year ($1.3 billion) at the current growth rate, losses are not shrinking much (down less than 2% year-over-year). The result: Ozon has already lost about $170 million so far this year, and is likely to end the year with a net loss. Ozon sold 33 million American Depositary Shares on IPO day, Tuesday. It sold another 4.5 million in a simultaneous private placement, and plans to sell nearly 5 million more\u00a0shares as underwriters exercise their overallotment options. (If you're counting, that's 42.5 million shares, total). At an IPO price of $30, this will ultimately raise close to $1.3 billion to fund the company's continued expansion. According to its prospectus, the company will probably end up with 184.2 million ADSs outstanding after the underwriters exercise their options. And because Ozon shares appreciated sharply after their IPO, rising past $40 a share, the company's total market capitalization is currently $7.4 billion.\u00a0"

    "article_text":"Yes, Tesla does more than make cars. And yes, there's a cult following and intense loyalty surrounding the brand. But ultimately, Tesla is much more an automaker than a tech company. It's valued like Google when it should be valued more like Ford. If this isn't a bubble, then I don't know what is. Image source: GM. GM's plan involves launching 30 electric vehicles globally by 2025, with over two-thirds of those vehicles set to be available in North America. All of GM's major brands -- Cadillac, GMC, Chevrolet, and Buick -- will have EV models available, and GM is promising options across the full spectrum of price points. On top of pouring resources into electric vehicles, GM is already ahead of the game when it comes to driver assistance systems. In October, Consumer Reports concluded that GM's Super Cruise system was at the top of the heap in its test of 17 systems. While Tesla's much-hyped Autopilot scored highly for capabilities and performance, Tesla lost badly to GM in other areas, including keeping the driver engaged, making it clear when it's safe to use, and dealing with an unresponsive driver. Another thing to remember: GM is profitable now, while other EV companies may never stop burning cash. GM produced over $4 billion of net income in the third quarter on $35.5 billion of revenue. GM stock has tripled since bottoming out in the pandemic-driven sell-off earlier this year, and shares still trade for less than 10 times the average analyst estimate for full-year earnings, and less than 8 times the estimate for next year's earnings. If you want to gamble, buy one of the bubble EV stocks that have gotten so much attention this year. If you want to invest, buy GM stock."

    "article_text":"Shorting is an investing concept that isn't well understood by many people, especially those who are new to the stock market. But we've got you covered. In this Nov. 17\u00a0Fool Live video, Fool.com contributors Matt Frankel, CFP, and Jason Hall break down what shorting is, how it works, and what investors need to know about the risks before considering it.\u00a0 Matt Frankel: We're going to start with short selling. I'll give you a quick rundown of what short selling means, and then we'll talk about why it's used and how to do it. I'll punt to Jason for that part. Short selling essentially means that it's a way to bet against the stock. Short selling means that you are literally borrowing shares of stock from your broker and selling them to other investors hoping that they go down, and then you could buy them back at a cheaper price and return them to your broker. If I want to bet against, say, Apple at $120 a share, I could borrow 10 shares of it from my broker, sell it to an investor at $120 a share so I get $1,200. My hope is that Apple goes down. If Apple goes down to $100 and I could buy back those 10 shares at $100 a share and return them to my broker, I've taken in $1,200 from completing the short sale, I can buy those shares back for $1,000, and that $200 difference is my profit. Sounds great, right? Jason, why do people sell stock short? Jason Hall: There's a couple of reasons. Number 1, I want to say that I think short selling is an important part of a healthy market. I think it's a reasonable way to invest. I know a lot of us, we see things on the boards, some Foolish stocks a lot of times get targeted by short sellers and then we get mad about it, and we immediately go to yelling and talking about these bad people and this bad thing they're doing. But I think in general, it's a healthy part of the market. The reason why people do it, and it's something that different Foolish portfolio services have offered, is because it's a way to extract income and profit. The bottom line is that if you see a company that you feel strongly in some reason, or your analysis has led you to believe that the price that investors are willing to pay today is not what investors are going to be willing to pay at some point in the near future, or you truly see some fundamental flaw with the business that's going to erode value and create opportunity, then you may decide to short that stock. Again, like I said, I think it can be a reasonable way to make money. But there's more to it because you also, in addition to the risks which we'll talk about, there's borrowing costs. When you're borrowing shares from somebody, they want something in return. Your broker wants a little piece of the action. So there's costs and interest and that sort of thing because you start taking on margin to short. Matt Frankel: We'll find out Jason's thoughts on margin in just a few minutes. I'll give you a hint; that's going to be the fun part of the show. Spoiler alert. But like you said, there's a few reasons people sell short, just might think the stocks too expensive? Let's just say that I think Tesla was too expensive. Jason Hall: I thought that when I was a Tesla shareholder. Matt Frankel: Let's just say that we think Tesla's too expensive. We would borrow shares, sell them short, and hope to buy them back cheaper. Another reason people sell short is to hedge against their other positions. A lot of people I know buy a short position in the overall S&P 500, for example. They have a portfolio of growth stocks and things like that, but then if the market goes the opposite way and just crashes like it did in March, then that serves as like a backstop and they can limit their losses in that sense. Jason Hall: You can almost treat it like insurance. Buying \"puts\" is another option. It's another thing that can be treated like a kind of insurance. Matt Frankel: Yeah, put options, it's a shorting alternative, I guess I'd call it. It has its benefits, but the mechanics of option trading are for another show for another day. Jason Hall: That's not a 10-minute segment. Matt Frankel: No, it's not. That's a good way to hedge. I've bought S&P puts to edge against market corrections and stuff like that in the past. Jason Hall: You can short an S&P instrument is your point, the same way they create some sort of a hedge. Matt Frankel: Sure, to create a hedge. That's another key point, that shorting doesn't have to be an individual company. You could just short the market, in other words. But shorting, there is a cautionary aspect of it that newer investors need to know before they do it. I like using Tesla as the example because I call it an unshortable stock, especially for newer investors, no matter how expensive you think it is. I mean, Tesla's what, 450 a share right now? Let's say that you think its intrinsic value is 20 bucks. I don't care. Don't short Tesla. The reason you don't short a stock that's volatile like that is because your losses are unlimited when you short. I mentioned my Apple example earlier where I'd say I'd borrow shares, sell them at 120, hope they go down. If Apple goes up to 200, I now have to buy the shares back at $200 a share and I've lost a lot of money. With some of these high-flying tech stocks, there is no real upper limit to how high they can get. Jason Hall: I think story stocks in general creates this additional layer of risk. Really, the best way to describe it is it's so much harder to predict what's going to happen. Sure, one could say, well, everything is a guessing game in the short term, and to a certain extent it is, right? Matt Frankel: Right. I was the guy who called Amazon expensive at $300 a share. People bring that up all the time so I might as well call myself out on it. But let's say I had shorted Amazon at $300 a share. It's now worth $3,000 a share, or even a little bit more. Jason Hall: 3,148 and change. Matt Frankel: Right. So your losses are essentially unlimited when it comes to shorting.\u00a0 Jason Hall: Here's the best way I figured out to describe what shorting really is. It is entirely the inverse of going long in every way, including the risks and the returns, which are inverted, plus fees that you have to pay to actually do the action. So the most you can make is a stock going to zero where you make all of your money less the fees that you had to pay to short. The most you can lose is tied to your ability to continue to watch the stock price go higher before either your broker forces you to close that short position or you realize that you just need to walk away and soak up a large loss."

    "article_text":"But just as investors overreacted to the downside in March on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic concerns, they now appear to be showing signs of overzealousness to the upside. Even though U.S. economic activity is nowhere near its pre-COVID-19 levels, the stock market is hitting new highs, and stocks within select industries are piling up triple-digit year-to-date gains. No matter how well or poorly the stock market is performing, there always seems to be at least one potential bubble waiting to burst. But with exuberance in full force following positive COVID-19 vaccine data, I see three dangerous bubbles waiting to collapse. Image source: Getty Images. One industry within the stock market that's exhibiting exceptionally high levels of irrational exuberance is electric vehicles, or EVs. Just like any next-big-thing investment, EV manufacturers are likely to face production expansion hurdles and competitive concerns as every auto company under the sun tries to get its foot in the door. Image source: Getty Images. As of mid-October, The Wall Street Journal reported that 143 SPACs had IPO'd on a year-to-date basis, with the average SPAC outperforming the broad-based S&P 500 by nearly a factor of four (35% versus 9%). With historically low lending rates and the prospect of a divided Congress likely to send the broader market higher with Joe Biden in the White House, investors have been more than willing to jump aboard the SPAC train.\u00a0 My suspicion is SPAC euphoria is going to produce far more losers than winners. Image source: Getty Images. Since the year began, the big three of crypto -- bitcoin, Ethereum, and Ripple -- have gained 152%, 321%, and 216%, respectively. While it is possible that digital payments are surging because of concerns about using physical cash during a pandemic, it's far more likely that the monster rally in cryptocurrencies is associated with short-term-focused and emotion-driven traders. Take bitcoin and its total market value of $337 billion. With approximately 40% of bitcoin's circulating supply held by investors who have zero desire to put these tokens back into circulation, it means there's only about $200 billion in bitcoin tokens that can be used for day-to-day transactions. This $200 billion might sound like a lot, but it doesn't even account for 0.25% of global gross domestic product. Based on utility, there's not a pathway to broad-based crypto adoption. The point is, a convincing case hasn't been made that world even needs digital tokens like bitcoin or Ripple. We've watched sentiment-driven cryptocurrencies implode before, and we'll almost certainly see it happen again."

    "article_text":"They can be used in portable consumer devices such as smartphones, smart watches, and other smart devices. They are also used in electric vehicles ranging from full-sized vehicles such as radio-controlled toy vehicles. These types of batteries require around 0.15 kg to 0.3 kg of lithium per kWh. As they are designed, these primary systems use a charged cathode which is an electro-active material with crystallographic vacancies that are filled gradually during the discharge. The lithium-ion battery has become the most sought-after battery for electric vehicles because of its lighter weight, smaller size, and longer life capacity than the other batteries that are available in the market. Some of the major manufacturers of lithium batteries include CATL, LGChem, BYD, and Samsung. As we step into the more modern-day in our everyday life, technological advancement is undeniable which is why the lithium batteries demand is expected to continuously increase to about 10 times between 2018 and 2030. The global revenues in 2025, for the lithium-ion market, is expected to exceed US$70 billion. With this growing demand, the lithium-ion battery industry is projected to hit 87.54 billion USD in 2027 at 13% CAGR. The increase in the demand is a result mostly of the projected electric vehicle boom of the world, experts are now projecting electric cars going from 2% market share in the year 2018 to around 25-35% by the year 2030. Added to this demand will be portable consumer devices, other non-car electric vehicles such as the modern-day e-bikes, e-3 wheelers, e-trucks, e-buses, etc, and as well as other energy storage. In 2025, it will have an estimated cost of US$110\/kWh per 1 MWh battery energy storage system. These batteries are used in the most powerful battery-operated vehicles today like the Tesla, which has a powerful battery that is charged by only electricity. This acts as gasoline for the car to run for a certain period of time. In other words, Tesla cars use lithium batteries in order to power up their supercars which is why unlike other cars that require gasoline, Tesla requires no traditional fuel filters, spark plug replacements, or even emission checks. Like electric cars, even brake pad replacements are rare because regenerative braking returns energy to the battery, significantly reducing wear on brakes. Currently, the world mines roughly 400,000 tons of lithium in a year, this is enough to power over around 2 million to 3 million electric vehicles, though only a third of that number goes to EVs right now. That number will have to increase perhaps as much as tenfold to meet Tesla\u2019s goal alone, and this doesn\u2019t even take into account other vehicle makers and lithium battery requirements. Although the lithium and battery industry has weakened during the Covid-19 pandemic brought about by the lower demand in electronic vehicles and consumer decisions of purchasing portable consumer devices, according to a GlobalData survey, the global lithium demand is expected to bounce back from the trauma of the pandemic at an estimated 47,300 tonnes in 2020 to 117,400 tonnes in the year 2024. Below we present to you the top 11 lithium and battery stocks to buy now based on our hedge fund sentiment data. These are the most popular lithium and battery stocks among the 800+ hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey: No of HFs: 0 Total Value of HF Holdings: 0 Piedmont Lithium Limited is an emerging lithium chemical company focused on the development of its Project in North Carolina.

No of HFs: 20 Total Value of HF Holdings: $61 Million Livent Corporation is known as a distributor and manufacturer of lithium chemicals, these lithium chemicals are used for applications in batteries, agrochemicals, aerospace alloys, and other industrial applications. The company has just been recently awarded the 2020 Gold Status for sustainability performance by the Global CSR rating agency, EcoVadis. This placed the company in the top 3 of all the companies that were evaluated in this group. The fund's top hedge fund holder was Robert Karr's Joho Capital which had more than $26 million invested in the stock at the end of September. Joho Capital boosted its stake in LTHM by 32% during the third quarter. No of HFs: 22 Total Value of HF Holdings: $107 Million EnerSys is one of the stored energy solutions for industrial applications. They produce and distribute reserve power and motive power batteries, battery charges, power machines, battery accessories, and outdoor equipment enclosure solutions to consumers worldwide. The company reported a net sales of US$340.8 million, down by 0.6% compared to the previous year during the same quarter. Although the recent pandemic impacted its revenue, the company remained optimistic with a strong cash flow as it exited the second quarter. Here is what EnerSys' CEO said in their press conference: \"We exited our 2nd quarter with a renewed sense of optimism as our incoming order rate approached pre-pandemic levels. COVID-19 adversely impacted our revenue in Q2, but lower costs including commodities led to another quarter of strong cash flow. We generated $217M of operating cash flows in H1. We continue to flex manufacturing capacity to match demand, minimizing manufacturing inefficiency while benefiting from raw material cost reductions. \" No of HFs: 24 Total Value of HF Holdings: $892 Million Johnson Controls International PLC is an Irish-owned multinational conglomerate based in Cork, Ireland, which manufactures fire, HVAC, and building safety equipment. They recently announced a grant by the United States Department of Energy under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) to build domestic manufacturing capacity for advanced batteries for hybrid and electric vehicles. Diversified technology and industrial company Johnson Controls International company Johnson Controls Internaional PLC underperformed after reporting disappointing quarterly results. We continue to believe the stock is trading at a significant discount to our estimate of intrinsic value and that the new management team has an attractive opportunity to grow that intristic value over time through continue operational improvements and shrewd capital allocation. The stock's top hedge fund holder is Ken Griffin's Citadel Investment Group which had more than US$241 million invested in the stock at the end of September. Coming in second is Harris Associates with more than US$237 Million. Johnson Controls for the quarter ending in September 2020 generated US$5.954B in revenue, a 5.1% decline year-on-year. For the twelve months ending September, revenue was US$22.317B, a 6.8% decline year on year."

    "article_text":"While \"recovery\" stocks have been making big moves upwards in November, 2020 has been a year when technology stocks have pulled away from the pack. Yet just because tech stocks have soared this year doesn't mean better things couldn't be in store in 2021. Here are three top tech names that have each beaten the broader market this year, yet which also have 2021 catalysts that could push them to even greater heights.\u00a0 Image source: Getty Images. Speaking of VMware, back in July, Dell stated its intention to spin off the rest of its 80.4% stake in VMware later in 2021.  Based on VMware's valuation of its publicly traded shares, Dell's VMware stake alone would be worth about $48 billion.  Currently, all of Dell is trading for about $52 billion, meaning the market is valuing the rest of Dell at just $4 billion.  Considering that the non-VMware portion of Dell has made $4.9 billion in operating income in the first nine months of 2020 alone, that seems quite pessimistic.  Of note, the spinoff would not become tax-free until September 2021. Still, Dell has been gaining in value relative to VMware as we get closer to that date, and that trend should continue next year. Alphabet doesn't have one specific catalyst like Dell, but rather a few different ones that could come to fruition in 2021. First, Alphabet's search revenue actually fell in the second quarter amid the pandemic for the first time ever, yet it recovered strongly in the third quarter. As the travel and leisure sectors recover after a vaccine is distributed, look for Alphabet's core search ad revenue to grow even more as the economy gets back to full strength. Currently, Prosus trades at a substantial discount to the value of its Tencent ownership alone, despite also owning about $30 billion worth of other international internet businesses in food delivery, online classifieds, digital payments, and education tech.  It's not clear that Naspers intends to cash in more of its Tencent stake when the three years is up. Yet given that Prosus trades at roughly a 30% discount and Naspers trades at a 50% discount to Tencent, management may choose to cash in more of its massive Tencent stake and engage in more financial engineering.  Even if that doesn't happen, however, Naspers\/Prosus management has promised more actions to close the yawning discount going forward. CEO Bob Van Dijk said on the recent conference call, \"what I want everyone to take back from this is we're working as hard on [closing the discount] as we are on the business. It's important to us. It's important for our shareholders and we want to make progress. And when we're ready, we'll come back and say that's where this is.\"  Naspers spun off Prosus in late 2019 and announced its buyback in 2020. Shareholders could look forward to at least one and perhaps more financial engineering actions next year, which will hopefully further close the discount to its prized asset."

    "article_text":"It makes sense that Apple is a popular stock on Robinhood. However, anyone who thinks Apple stock is a safe bet that can't go wrong could be in for a big surprise. Here are three reasons why Apple may not be the best stock to own. Image source: Getty Images. The smartphone market in developed countries is largely saturated. There just aren't many potential new customers who don't yet use a smartphone. This means that Apple's iPhone business in these countries is largely just selling existing iPhone users on new versions. That's all well and good, but it's not going to be a major growth driver for Apple. Apple's iPhone business is dependent on the company convincing users that its latest devices are the next big thing. That gets harder as smartphones get better. Five years ago, the year-to-year leap in smartphone quality was significant. Today, not so much. Yes, Apple can grow its iPhone user base in countries like India where it doesn't dominate the market. But those markets are brutally competitive. Apple currently has a single-digit market share in that country, and inexpensive iPhone alternatives from Chinese manufacturers will make it tough for the situation to change. The iPhone business will ebb and flow, with some year's models proving more popular than others. But it isn't going to be a meaningful source of growth for Apple. Apple has been making a big push into services in recent years, selling its user base on subscriptions for music, video streaming, games, and cloud storage. The company even recently announced an all-in-one subscription that bundles many of its services together. Services have become big business for Apple. In fiscal 2020, Apple generated nearly $54 billion from its services segment. Services are now the second largest source of revenue for Apple, topped only by the iPhone. While the services growth story sounds great, there are a couple problems. For one, Apple generates a huge chunk of its services revenue from a deal with Alphabet's Google that makes Google the default search engine on iOS. This deal, which involves Google paying Apple between $8 billion and $12 billion annually, is being targeted in an antitrust lawsuit against Google. These payments are essentially all profit for Apple, so losing them would take a big bite out of the bottom line. A separate antitrust lawsuit against Apple in the U.S. could be coming as well, focused on the company's policies and fees related to the App Store and payments. If Apple is forced to reduce how much it charges developers or loosen its grip on app distribution or payments, the services segment will suffer. The services growth story for Apple could hit a brick wall if things don't go the company's way on the antitrust front, and earnings could plunge under the worst-case scenario. Despite a largely stagnant iPhone business and a services business that's under attack by antitrust regulators, Apple stock is priced for growth. Apple currently trades for around 36 times earnings; that's down from closer to 40 times earnings a couple months ago, but it's higher than at any other point since the financial crisis. Apple's net income dropped 7.4% in its fiscal fourth quarter, dragged down by a slumping iPhone business. Net income was up just 3.9% in fiscal 2020, despite strong demand for Mac computers, iPads, and other non-iPhone gadgets amid the pandemic. Those aren't the kinds of growth rates that scream \"36 times earnings.\" Apple is already worth around $2 trillion. The pricey stock has provided exceptional returns for shareholders up to this point, but the company may be too big and facing too many risks to do anything but disappoint investors from here on out."

    "article_text":"Stepping into a hot stock at exactly the right time is plenty of fun. The fact is, however, that stock picking should be a relatively boring affair for most of us most of the time. Investors are generally best served by finding quality names and then letting time do the hard work. That's not to suggest investors should limit themselves to just growth or just value. Likewise, a winning portfolio typically consists of dividend stocks as well as stocks of companies that pour every bit of their profits back into their own growth. Above all else, quality is the key. To this end, here's a look four quality names that investors aiming to build a retirement nest egg should consider. They're all quite different from one another, but in all four cases, these stocks could be considered best-of-breed picks within their respective industries. Image source: Getty Images. And Edison International truly is an international play. While U.S. consumers most likely know the company through its Southern California Edison, its Edison Energy arm does business through partnerships in Europe, South America, and Australia as well. This mix has helped smooth out any earnings volatility the company may have otherwise suffered. Prologis isn't just a dividend payer presently yielding 2.3% with no growth prospects, though. While the contagion has slowed its ability to do so, the real estate investment trust is always on the hunt for new properties to purchase and then rent out. What this company lacks in payout potential, though, it more than makes up for in marketability of its products. It's still the premier name in office productivity software, with cloud-based offerings like Office 365 driving a 21% year-over-year increase in revenue during the quarter that ended in September. Skeptics will argue that nothing lasts forever, adding that Alphabet's Google may be nearing its maximum reach. That stance assumes Alphabet won't find new ways to connect with the world's web users, and ignores the company's existing position within the search engine space. StatCounter's Global Stats indicate that Google still fields nearly 93% of the globe's web searches, while its Android operating system is found on 73% of the world's mobile devices. Those numbers have remained relatively steady, too, despite stepped-up competition on both fronts."

    "article_text":"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Having watched warily from the wings, McDonald\u2019s Corp. is finally entering the modern meatless-market with a menu of herbivorous items. Top of the list is the plant-based burger, McPlant: \u201cThere are other plant-based burgers out there, but the McPlant delivers our iconic taste in a sink-your-teeth-in (and wipe-your-mouth) kind of sandwich. It\u2019s made with a juicy, plant-based patty and served on a warm, sesame seed bun with all the classic toppings.\u201d Although McPlant is a notable pivot for a company that grinds through a billion pounds of American beef each year, McDonald\u2019s is being a soup\u00e7on coy: The \u201cother plant-based burgers\u201d to which they allude include Burger King\u2019s Impossible Whopper, Wendy\u2019s The Plantiful, White Castle\u2019s Impossible Sliders, and Carl\u2019s Jr. Beyond Burger \u2014 as well as groundbreaking consumer products from Impossible Foods, Beyond Meat, and Kellogg\u2019s Incogmeato. Because 89% of meatless-burger consumers are neither vegetarian nor vegan, and because the plant-based meat market may soon be worth $35.4 billion, faux-meat firms seem less keen on promoting plants than blurring the plant\/meat divide. This explains their use of beet powder, annatto and heme to simulate the ooze of blood, and the carnivorous tone of their branding. It\u2019s surely no accident that McPlant retains its corporate prefix, that Beyond Meat and Incogmeato deploy a muscular suffix and that Impossible Foods toys with a knowing oxymoron. These modern plant-based brands are a world away from the earnest worthiness of meatless 1.0 \u2014 Quorn, Linda McCartney\u2019s, Turtle Island Foods \u2014 a trick they pull off with all the techniques of \u201cdazzle.\u201d * * * In 1917, in response to the increasing threat from German submarines, the British artist Norman Wilkinson pioneered a counterintuitive form of marine camouflage(1) that he called \u201cdazzle painting.\u201d Recognizing that, even before radar, massive ships could never be rendered invisible, Wilkinson proposed making them harder for U-boats to identify, size, track and target. \u201cSo-called invisibility against submarine attack [he wrote] is not only impossible, but dangerous, and consequently if a vessel can be seen at all, it does not matter how visible she is, providing her course remains a matter of question for the attacker.\u201d Wilkinson fostered enemy uncertainty by painting crazy monochrome zigzags and stripes across every inch of hull, deck and funnel until some 4,000 British and American vessels resembled bizarre aquatic zebras. The tactical twist of Wilkinson\u2019s dazzle was to ensure that what cannot be concealed should confuse: \u201cThe primary object of this scheme was not so much to cause the enemy to miss his shot when actually in firing position \u2026 but to mislead him, when the ship was first sighted, as to the correct position to take up.\u201d Naturally, such ingenious misdirection is readily applicable to branding. * * * Some of the most conspicuous \u201cdazzle\u201d proliferates with \u201chedonic\u201d brands \u2014 those where pleasure-seeking consumers must be persuaded that \u201cbad\u201d is \u201cgood\u201d: That \u201cgood\u201d is \u201cbad\u201d: Or that \u201cbad\u201d is \u201cbad\u201d \u2014 but, hey, what the hell: Modern meatless burgers operate in the intersection of all three dazzles: They are simultaneously meaty (\u201cbad\u201d but delicious), vegetarian (\u201cgood\u201d but boring) and a fast-food treat (\u201cnaughty but nice\u201d)(2). This dazzling triad also distracts from the complex question of whether meatless burgers are as good for one\u2019s wallet, health or the environment as might be hoped. Inevitably, hedonistic dazzle is used by a range of adult brands, not least Las Vegas\u2019s hugely successful \u201cWhat happens here, stays here\u201d campaign \u2014 which slyly encouraged the sins of Sin City, even as it elided the wages of sin. * * * Many brands, most notably in the auto sector, hide behind bait-and-switch safety disclaimers that dangle the rush of danger while evading its results. Given that 1.35 million people died on the roads in 2018 (including 36,835 Americans), the deployment of \u201cdazzle tags\u201d like \u201cProfessional driver on a closed course\u201d and \u201cDemonstration only, do not attempt\u201d seems more akin to using Freddy Krueger to sell kitchen knives than offering a satisfactory deterrent to vehicular mayhem. Indeed, it\u2019s probably no coincidence that health-related \u201cdazzle tags\u201d often achieve the opposite of their purported aim. In 2017, research by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration concluded that snack foods labelled as \u201cvitamin-fortified\u201d confused consumers into making \u201cpoor dietary decisions.\u201d And in 2014, research from Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health indicated that alcohol \u201cresponsibility messages\u201d (\u201cdrink responsibly,\u201d \u201cenjoy in moderation\u201d) were \u201coverwhelmingly used to promote products rather than convey relevant public health information.\u201d One of the oddest \u201cdanger dazzles\u201d was that attempted by Death Cigarettes, a short-lived \u201990s venture that trumped the \u201cdistraction dazzle\u201d of Big Tobacco (cool camels, rugged cowboys, cut silk) with tombstone packs adorned with a skull and crossbones. While traditional cigarette brands attempt to subvert popular culture, Death Cigarettes set up shop where the unstoppable force of addiction meets the immovable object of death. This is not hiding in plain sight, so much as hiding in the spotlight \u2014 and as Rochefoucauld said, \u201cneither the sun nor death can be looked at steadily.\u201d(3) The impact of such blatant dazzle is similar to the optical effect of Anish Kapoor\u2019s deeply pigmented \u201cVoid\u201d sculptures, which draw in one\u2019s gaze while defocusing one\u2019s vision. Kapoor defined the illusion thus: \u201cYou can see it with your eyes. Then you can\u2019t see it. Yet you know it. You know it with your body. Your imagination senses it.\u201d * * * Just as dazzle painting helped warships to conceal their size, so dazzle branding helps underdogs bark above their bite. There are numerous examples of such shape-shifting strategies, including Volkswagen\u2019s 1959 \u201cThink small\u201d slogan, which neatly mocked the muscle car, and Apple\u2019s 1997 \u201cThink different\u201d campaign, which strove to mainstream the marginalized: \u201cHere\u2019s to the crazy ones, the misfits, the rebels, the troublemakers, the round pegs in the square holes \u2026 the ones who see things differently \u2014 they\u2019re not fond of rules, and they have no respect for the status quo.\u201d Such campaigns echo the actions of those animals that change their size and shape in order to deter predators and attract mates \u2014 two goals shared by brands of every dimension. One of advertising\u2019s longest underdog dazzles was that deployed by Avis between 1962 and 2012. Unable to conceal its ranking, Avis sought instead to confuse the idea that \u201cbiggest is best\u201d: Significantly, Avis was not defending its second place status but attacking the market leader for being number one and, by extension, for complacence and slapdashery. So effective was this insurgency that the alpha-brand Hertz felt compelled to respond \u2014 the advertising equivalent of forcing a U-boat to surface. An elegant variation on the underdog dazzle was successfully launched in 2000 by the British Teacher Training Agency. Facing the challenge of luring high-caliber candidates into classrooms, they confronted the sneering clich\u00e9 \u201cThose who can, do; those who can\u2019t, teach\u201d with a splendidly contrarian campaign, \u201cThose who can, teach.\u201d One of Britain\u2019s best-loved adverts arose from a similar desire to upend accepted wisdom. In 1983, unable to conceal that its telephone directory was used primarily for \u201cthe nasty things in life, like a blocked drain,\u201d Yellow Pages ran an advert that was deeply human, sentimental and above all nice. Brands that strongly divide consumer sentiment occasionally use dazzle to negate opprobrium or laugh it off. Marmite\u2019s response to 33% of Brits loathing its yeast-extract spread was not to hug the haters but double down on the hate. In so doing it created the instantly viral campaign, \u201cMarmite: You either love it or hate it.\u201d Similarly, certain fans of the British football club Millwall revel in their unpopularity with the defiant chant \u201cNo one likes us we don\u2019t care\u201d (sung to the tune of Rod Stewart\u2019s \u201cSailing\u201d) which, over time, has evolved into a sub-brand of its own: * * * For obvious reasons, dazzle is a finely honed tool of political communication \u2014 as the BBC\u2019s Yes Minister elegantly satirized: Sir Humphrey: As long as we can head him off this Open Government nonsense. Bernard: But I thought we were calling the White Paper \u201cOpen Government\u201d? Sir Humphrey: Yes, well, always dispose of the difficult bit in the title. It does less harm there than in the text. Sir Arnold: It\u2019s the law of inverse relevance. The less you intend to do about something, the more you have to keep talking about it. This chimes with the Fox News slogan \u201cFair and Balanced,\u201d which was devised by Roger Ailes when he launched the network in 1996. As Gabriel Sherman wrote in 2017, when the slogan was retired: \u201cIn the annals of modern advertising, \u2018Fair & Balanced\u2019 will be considered a classic. The slogan was Ailes\u2019s cynical genius at its most successful. While liberals mocked the tagline, it allowed Ailes to give viewers the appearance of both sides being heard, when in fact he made sure producers staged segments so that the conservative viewpoint always won.\u201d Brands regularly turn to dazzle when they find themselves edging toward the wrong side of history. It is often claimed that Alfred Nobel established his eponymous prizes after reading his own damning obituary (\u201cThe merchant of death is dead\u201d) which was erroneously published after his brother\u2019s demise. Whether or not this legend is true, the legacy dazzle worked: How many more people associate the name Nobel with literature, science and peace than with the invention of dynamite? In 2004, Unilever hired Wolff Olins to transform its impersonal, industrial and Twin Towers-ish identity into something more sensitive, playful and environmentally beguiling: The result \u2014 with its casual script, dazzling sparkles and 24 cute icons \u2014 is more akin to a fossil agglomeration than the branding of a global behemoth that emits 100 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents each year. And this exculpatory effect was surely the point. Similarly, the \u201cgreen rush\u201d of airlines using carbon offsets to sell \u201cnet-zero carbon flights\u201d may be less ecological, than a tactical response to \u201cflygskam\u201d \u2014 the Swedish \u201cflight shaming\u201d trend that has taken wing. The dazzle of consumer carbon offsetting was deftly skewered by Camilla Cavendish: \u201cEasyJet, in pledging to offset the emissions from its flights for what will be less than \u00a31 a ticket, is effectively offering a \u2018get out of hell free\u2019 card. Passengers can tick the \u2018offset\u2019 box and continue on their merry way, unaware that the offer prices carbon dioxide well below its trading value. \u2026 Carbon offsetting is shaping up to be the greatest mis-selling scandal since the Dominican friar Johann Tetzel sold pardons to redeem the dead.\u201d In 2000, Landor helped British Petroleum transition from a \u201cpart of the problem\u201d \u201cbig oil\u201d giant to a \u201cpart of the solution\u201d \u201cleading energy company.\u201d It did so by dumping the company\u2019s 70-year-old shield for a \u201chelios\u201d sunburst, next to which the lower-case, superscript \u201cbp\u201d name is almost an afterthought. This (literally) dazzling redesign stumbled in 2010, when BP\u2019s drilling rig Deepwater Horizon exploded, killing 11 and disgorging 4 million barrels of oil into the Gulf of Mexico. It\u2019s likely nothing could have limited the damage to BP\u2019s brand after such a disaster, but the chasm between the environmental ostentation of BP\u2019s sunburst and the bleak reality of oil exploration added insult to injury, as evinced by the logo-redesign competition Greenpeace launched: (Greenpeace is itself arguably something of a dazzle brand. Although the organization espouses non-violence, given its advocacy of dramatic and sometimes damaging direct action, Greenpeace may be green but it is far from entirely pacific.) Of course, there are limits to what even dazzle can achieve. The story of Monsanto\u2019s brand can be told in three logos: * * * It\u2019s a pleasing coincidence that capitalism\u2019s ultimate dazzle brand dazzles literally as well as metaphorically \u2014 so much so that almost everything consumers know and feel about diamonds was concocted by De Beers and its roster of advertising talent. As Edward Jay Epstein detailed in his legendary 1982 essay and book: \u201cThe diamond invention \u2014 the creation of the idea that diamonds are rare and valuable, and are essential signs of esteem \u2014 is a relatively recent development in the history of the diamond trade.\u201d Although the disco-ball of diamond\u2019s dazzle is multifaceted, a few examples from Epstein and others will suffice: The \u201csalary rule\u201d that an engagement ring should cost one month\u2019s salary was devised in the 1930s to draw the middle-class into diamond ownership; in the 1980s the rate mysteriously rose to two month\u2019s salary, or three in Japan. The image of men surprising women with a diamond was insinuated into Hollywood movies both to associate diamonds with romantic love, and because men spend more on jewels when shopping alone. The \u201ceternity ring\u201d was devised not as a celebration of everlasting love, but to create a new market for a vast cache of miniature Russian diamonds. In addition to emphasizing the emotional resonance of diamonds, the slogan \u201cA diamond is forever\u201d helped discourage women from selling their jewels and thereby discovering that diamonds may not be the appreciating investment they believed. * * * In February, Burger King trumpeted the removal of artificial additives from its sandwiches with an advertisement that depicted a Whopper slowly rotting over 34 time-lapsed days: This unsettling film (more Peter Greenaway than Bobby Flay) proved as contentious as Burger King\u2019s global CMO Fernando Machado clearly intended: \u201cI don\u2019t have the media money to throw something at people that\u2019s not going to stand out or get noticed. In this case specifically, we were expecting some controversy and debate.\u201d Machado also alluded to the power of dazzle: \u201cThe essence of the idea is to show something that you know, in theory, is bad \u2014 mold \u2014 but it\u2019s shown in such a beautiful, stunning way and you\u2019re talking about it as a positive. \u2026 It almost messes with your mind. You know mold isn\u2019t good, but it looks so beautiful!\u201d Burger King\u2019s spot was unarguably a hit, but what actually \u201cmesses with your mind\u201d is the advert\u2019s slight of brand. While eliminating unnecessary additives is admirable, it\u2019s hardly the defining challenge of fast food compared, say, with its role in obesity, diabetes, addiction, academic performance, depression and social inequality. Like an arms dealer singing the praises of a gun\u2019s silencer, the \u201cmoldy\u201d Whopper\u2019s real success may be diverting our gaze from the uncomfortable nutritional truth that even an Impossible Whopper with unsalted medium fries delivers 1,010 calories, 50 grams of fat, 13 grams of saturated fat, 1,440 milligrams of sodium and 13 grams of sugar. Kander and Ebb were right: Give \u2019em the old razzle dazzleRazzle Dazzle \u2019emGive \u2019em an act with lots of flash in itAnd the reaction will be passionateGive \u2019em the old hocus pocusBead and feather \u2019emHow can they see with sequins in their eyes? (1) Although Wilkinson was decisive in the military application of dazzle, the idea of disruptive camouflage owes much to the work of the American artist Abbott Handerson Thayer and the Scottish zoologist John Graham Kerr \u2014 both of whom draw the origins of \u201cdazzle\u201d back to the animal kingdom. (2) \u201cNaughty but nice\u201d was a National Dairy Council campaign to promote fresh cream cakes (!) in the 1970s and \u201980s; the slogan was devised by none other than Salman Rushdie. (3) Le soleil ni la mort ne se peuvent regarder fixement\u201d in the original French. This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.

I want them to be able to type into a search bar and get the answer to a natural language question. That's what QuickSight Q aims to do. It's a direct challenge to a number of business intelligence startups and another instance of the way machine learning and natural language processing are changing business processes across multiple industries. \"The way Q works. Type in a question in natural language [like]... 'Give me the trailing twelve month sales of product X?'... You get an answer in seconds.

    "article_text":"November was an amazing month for the stock market, but investors tried to start December with the same kind of upward momentum. Market participants often look for bullish moves to finish a year, especially when the overall stock market has been on a solid upswing. That's definitely been the case in 2020, as stocks recovered sharply from the coronavirus-inspired bear market in March and have gained ground with only mild corrections ever since. Shares of BlackBerry soared 57% on Tuesday morning. The maker of what was once the most popular handheld mobile device has seen a major shift in its business model in recent years, but a new deal could make the company relevant again in a fast-growing field. The potential uses for BlackBerry's platform are almost limitless. Adverse driving conditions, like traffic or bad weather, could prompt BlackBerry-enabled vehicles to enable safety features, while monitors could check on young drivers for safety considerations or provide alerts when child-safety locks aren't properly engaged. Image source: Sephora. Elsewhere, Kohl's saw its stock jump 15%. The retailer has had a tough year, but a new strategic move could have things looking a lot better for 2021 and beyond. Kohl's entered into a strategic partnership with Sephora to open \"Sephora at Kohl's\" in-store shops. The arrangement will involve 200 stores by the end of 2021, with the goal of expanding to 850 by 2023. Sephora will also appear on the Kohls.com website as part of what it calls \"its unique immersive prestige beauty experience.\" It's good to see a day on which recent IPOs take a backseat to well-established companies. Moreover, it signals a broadening of the bull market, which, in turn, could help investors get even more gains in the future."

With Penney's shrinking footprint, it's not a surprise that Sephora is looking for a new retail partner. With Penney, Sephora demonstrated an ability to drive traffic, and investors are clearly expecting a similar benefit for Kohl's. Kohl's strategy increasingly appears to be tying itself to other brands in order to drive traffic to its stores.

    "article_text":"COVID-19 has changed the way we do our shopping. More people are shopping for more things online instead of going into stores, accelerating the shift to e-commerce. And these changes seem fairly permanent, as the pandemic has brought in new customers and opened new retail verticals for online shopping. With more shopping happening online, marketers are quickly following consumers. That's good for both Google and Amazon.\u00a0 Image source: Amazon. But considering the high purchase intent of Amazon searches, the influx of digital advertising in categories like consumer packaged goods or electronics heavily favors the retailer instead of the general search engine. Amazon has been eating into Google's share of product searches for years. And those searches are some of its most valuable. With Amazon seeing an influx of spending on its marketplace and growth in Prime memberships during the pandemic, investors should expect its share of product searches to have followed suit. And with more searches, there are more opportunities to sell ads. The growth of Amazon's advertising business has supported strong operating margin expansion and ought to continue to support Amazon's bottom line as consumer packaged good ad spending keeps shifting online. But Google is under investigation of antitrust practices in its dealings with Apple. What's more, Apple is reportedly developing its own search engine, which could compete with Google. If Google's forced to relinquish its hold on Safari's default search engine in one way or another, it's not like Google's share of search traffic goes to zero on the iPhone. Google still has many popular services on the iPhone despite competing default services from Apple. Google currently dominates mobile search, thanks in part to its partnership with Apple. If that relationship changes for any reason, it could put a damper on Google's ability to take the majority of search ad growth on mobile as it has in the past. It's worth reiterating the accelerating shift to e-commerce will benefit Google at least some, even if it's not as much as it benefits Amazon. Furthermore, Google and other digital advertisers will see benefits from accelerations in cord-cutting, leading to more marketers seeking digital advertising. In fact, eMarketer now expects search advertising to grow faster long-term than it forecast pre-pandemic. Google still has a lot of growth ahead, but it has a few hurdles in its way. Meanwhile, Amazon's runway is clear for accelerating advertising revenue."

The data analysis firm expects the holiday season will pull in $184 billion in U.S. online sales. The downward revision comes after Adobe said Cyber Monday sales rose 15.1% from the prior year to $10.8 billion, near the low-end of a prior forecast. On the positive side of the ledger, this year\u2019s Cyber Monday represented the largest U.S. online shopping day in history \u2014 that surpassed last year\u2019s record of $9.4 billion hit on Cyber Monday 2019. Adobe\u2019s Cyber Monday online read only serves to crystallize the less than inspiring start to holiday shopping for retailers. The sector is battling the one-two punch of consumers avoiding physical stores amid fear of getting sick and cautious spending online due to rising joblessness. The National Retail Federation said Tuesday, consumers spent $50 less year-over-year on holiday gifts, food and decorations from Black Friday to Cyber Monday. The number of shoppers out and about spending during the Black Friday to Cyber Monday period fell by roughly 3.2 million versus last year. \u201cAlthough stores had limits in terms of capacity, there were no real lines outside of the stores (Best Buy had picked up when we visited Friday evening; but the line seemed to reflect some capacity limits); and finding a parking spot is the easiest it has been in 15 years of store checks,\u201d points out Goldman Sachs retail analyst Kate McShane. Adds McShane, \u201cWe think the lack of crowds was already a strong hypothesis going into Black Friday given the pandemic and the trend towards digital leading up to now; however we think promotions being pulled forward to early October (we think the kick off was Amazon Prime Days on 10\/13-10\/14) likely drove a lot of early and online shopping, resulting in possible reduced demand this holiday weekend.\u201d We would be leaning toward the latter choice.

    "article_text":"Roku's growth accelerated as more people bought its streaming devices to watch shows and movies at home. Disney's growth decelerated as it shut down its theme parks, dealt with theater closures and delayed movies, and continued to lose cable subscribers to streaming platforms. Image source: Roku. Roku generated 71% of its revenue from its platform business in\u00a0the first nine months of 2020. This business generates most of its revenue from online ads and content distribution partnerships on its software platform. The remaining 29% of its revenue came from its player business, which sells its streaming hardware devices. The platform business generates much higher margins than the player business, and it generated 92% of its gross profit during the first nine months of the year. Disney generated 43% of its revenue from its Media Networks (broadcast and cable networks) unit in fiscal 2020, which ended in October. Its parks, experiences, and products division generated 25% of its revenue. Its direct-to-consumer and international (DTCI) unit, which controls its growing streaming unit, accounted for 26% of its revenue. The studio entertainment business, which handles its movie properties, accounted for another 15%. That total percentage exceeded 100% in 2020 due to eliminations between its shifting business segments. Roku's total revenue rose 57% year-over-year in the first nine months of the year, as its platform and player revenues rose 66% and 40%, respectively. Its 57% year-over-year jump in player unit sales during the third quarter notably marked its strongest growth in hardware shipments in over seven years. That robust growth indicates it isn't losing the market to rivals like Alphabet's Google Chromecast, Amazon's Fire TV, and Apple TV. Roku also finished the third quarter with 46 million active accounts, up 43% from a year earlier, and its average revenue per user (ARPU) rose 20% to $27.00 as users consumed more content and ads on it platform. However, Roku's gross margin declined as lower ad sales throughout the crisis reduced the platform unit's margins and offset its improving hardware margins. Its net loss also widened year-over-year from $44.2 million to $84.8 million in the first nine months, but it posted an operating profit in the third quarter as it cut costs throughout the pandemic. Disney's revenue fell 6% in\u00a0fiscal 2020, as rising revenue at its media networks and DTCI segments offset the double-digit declines at its studio entertainment unit and parks, experiences, and products unit. However, the loss of its higher-margin theme park and movie revenue, along with widening losses at the DTCI's streaming segment, crushed its margins and reduced its adjusted earnings by 65%. Image source: Disney. But Disney still faces an uphill battle in 2021. Its parks could close again as COVID-19 cases surge worldwide, and it could take months for a vaccine to be widely distributed. Even if the pandemic ends, the economic fallout could reduce visits to Disney's pricey parks. Its studio business will face tough year-over-year comparisons against Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker and Frozen 2, and its cable networks will likely continue to lose subscribers as it pours more cash into its money-losing streaming platforms. Analysts expect Disney's revenue to rise\u00a05% and for its earnings to dip 3% this year. But next year, they expect its revenue to rise 20% and for its earnings to more than double as its business stabilizes. That outlook seems promising, but there's still too much optimism baked into the stock at over 60 times forward earnings. I've owned shares of Disney for years, but I wouldn't add shares right now. The company isn't out of the woods yet, and the stock's premium valuation doesn't accurately reflect its near-term challenges. Roku, however, has impressed me over the past few quarters. It didn't buckle under competitive pressure from Amazon and other big rivals, and its platform continued to lock in advertisers, partners, and viewers. Roku's stock is still reasonably valued relative to its revenue growth, and its margins could improve again as ad sales accelerate. Therefore, it's still a compelling buy after its massive rally this year."

    "url":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/amazons-cloud-unit-taps-own-170924561.html",
    "article_text":"By Stephen Nellis Dec 1 (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc's cloud unit on Tuesday offered a new supercomputing service based on its self-designed processors, a further sign of how chips based on Arm Ltd's technology are encroaching on Intel Corp and Advanced Micro Devices Inc turf. Amazon Web Services, or AWS, sells its computing services based on the customer's choice of an underlying central processor chip. Software developers have traditionally chosen between Intel or AMD products, but since 2018 Amazon has also offered its own \"Graviton\" chips designed with technology from Arm, which is in the midst of a $40 billion takeover by Nvidia Corp. Arm-based chips have long powered mobile phones because they can operate on very low power levels, but they are increasingly used in data centers where their power efficiency helps control costs. The world's fastest computing system, the Fugaku supercomputer in Japan, is based on Arm chips. Supercomputing helps with tasks such as weather forecasting, medical research and modeling aerodynamics for cars without a wind tunnel. But systems remain expensive and mostly operated by governments and research centers. AWS is hoping to slash costs, saying the new service will get 40% better price-to-performance than its similar offerings from AMD and Intel. AWS's own technology will quickly pass data through multiple Graviton processors, a key supercomputing process in which many chips act as a hive mind to tackle a large task. AWS will rent the service out so that researchers need not build or manage a system. Supercomputing \"is no longer this thing that only governments do,\" Dave Brown, vice president of Elastic Compute Cloud at AWS, said in an interview. \"You can decrease the cost \u2013 you don't need a supercomputer any more. You can spin them up in the cloud and then spin them down.\" (Reporting by Stephen Nellis in San Francisco; Editing by Richard Chang)"

    "article_text":"Nutanix's fiscal first-quarter year-over-year revenue decline of 0.6%, to $312.8 million, seems weak given the attractive market for the hybrid cloud (any combination of public and private cloud) that the company addresses. The research outfit Mordor Intelligence estimates that the hybrid cloud market will have a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 18.7% by 2025. Image source: Getty Images. Nutanix is poised to capture that opportunity. Its hyper-converged infrastructure software simplifies the administration of the server, storage, and networking hardware infrastructures by virtualizing them and making them look like a private cloud. And last quarter, the company expanded its footprint to public clouds thanks to partnerships with Microsoft\u00a0and Amazon, enabling new features such as seamless application mobility between private and public clouds. In the medium term, Nutanix's solutions should allow customers to seamlessly run any workload (cloud applications) on any cloud. Despite its attractive offering, Nutanix has had heavy losses over the last several years. During the last quarter, losses increased to $265.0 million, compared to $229.3 million one year ago, because of huge sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue (82.3% during the last quarter). That poor performance partly explains why management decided to transition its sales strategy from multiyear deals to annual subscriptions in 2018 (the pivot of the tech industry to subscription offerings didn't leave many other options anyway). Revenue will remain less relevant in gauging Nutanix's performance during the transition to a subscription-based business. Therefore, management is focusing instead on metrics that depend on annual contract value (ACV), which corresponds to the total annualized value of a contract, excluding amounts related to professional services and hardware. It also aligned its sales force's compensation scheme last quarter with ACV-based metrics. Usually, I become rather skeptical when executives switch their attention to non-GAAP (adjusted) metrics. But given Nutanix's transition to a subscription-based offering, that decision makes sense. Compared to GAAP revenue, ACV-based metrics better match the ratable nature of subscriptions, which better represents the company's performance as it switches to subscriptions. So looking at the fiscal first-quarter results, the run-rate ACV (the sum of all ACV contracts at the end of the period) grew 29% year over year to $1.29 billion. And management expects run-rate ACV to increase by 25% during the next quarter. Those results indicate the transition to subscriptions is succeeding, and performance seems better than suggested by the revenue decline during the last quarter."

Cyber Monday discounts included as much as 28% off computers. Shoppers should expect discounts to lessen by 5% to 10% across many categories as we get closer to Christmas Day, according to Adobe. Still Marshal Cohen, NPD Retail\u2019s chief industry adviser, notes on Twitter that \u201cCyber Week continues,\u201d as his inbox fills with promotions. \u201c[W]e expect ongoing upside for retail and into next year\nand believe, for the first time in a while, the power lies in the hands of the\nretailers and their inventory management; the question will be who chooses to hold\nthe line versus cross it,\u201d wrote analysts led by Simeon Siegel. So far this holiday season, Adobe says online shoppers have spent $106.5 billion, up 27.7% from last year. Numerator data found Amazon was \u201cthe big winner\u201d for the\nweekend with 19% of total spend, or $1 of every $5 spent. Amazon kicked off its holiday shopping season with a delayed Prime Day shopping event in October. U.S. consumers spent an average of $89.20 per order with New York, Los Angeles and London among the top cities."

    "article_text":"Anaplan's third-quarter revenue increased 28% year over year to $115 million. This figure topped management's outlook from a few months ago for revenue to be as much as $110 million. Customers and prospective customers are still being affected by the pandemic, but Anaplan continues to make progress getting itself back to pre-crisis growth rates. Revenue increased 45% last year, its first full year as a public company after a late-2018 IPO.  Within the quarterly total, subscription revenue to the company's cloud-based ERP software, which an organization uses to plan everything from finances to inventory management to a marketing campaign, grew 31% from a year ago and made up over 91% of total sales. CEO Frank Calderoni said that some 60% of new bookings came from existing customers, reflecting the challenging environment for large organizations trying to free up enough budget to execute on their digital transformation.  It looks like those companies that have already embarked on their new digital journey remain in the best position to engage with Anaplan. But new deal activity is still unthawing after the freeze in the spring during the worst of the economic lockdowns. Calderoni said customers paying Anaplan at least $250,000 a year increased to 417, a 29% increase from a year ago. Image source: Getty Images. In total, Anaplan had over 1,500 customers at the end of Q3. This is still a small firm that competes in a large ERP software space worth tens of billions in global spending every year, with tech giants like Oracle, SAP, and Workday dominating the space. The market could be seeing better times soon as COVID-19 vaccines and treatments could lead to gradual normalization of the economy.  In spite of current challenges, Anaplan is making progress and setting itself up for years of growth in a post-pandemic world. Calderoni and his team said they talk to many executives a week, and end-to-end operational changes to adapt to the new digital era are top of mind for these executives. Anaplan figures to be part of those changes -- both current and future. Its software helps connect data throughout an organization to help planning teams make better decisions and predictions and untether them from reliance on past results in lieu of more timely cloud-based information. It hasn't been only existing customers propelling Anaplan's recent acceleration in growth, though. The company said one of the top 50 largest companies in the U.S. recently tapped Anaplan's ERP software to manage a more than 10,000-member salesforce, with everything from new-hire onboarding to sales forecasting getting plugged into the planning software. A healthcare distribution company with over $15 billion in annual revenue also signed up to update its processes for the new digital era. Besides replacing some of its legacy ERP rivals, Anaplan said some of these new deals are retiring decades-old software developed by IT teams in-house. \u00a0 However, as it focuses on serving large organizations, Anaplan's rebound is still tied to a greater economic recovery. Management had positive news on that front, though. Fourth-quarter revenue is forecast to be as much as 22% higher than last year, but preliminary fiscal 2022 guidance (for the 12 months ended Jan. 31, 2022) was also provided. At $550 million in sales, it implies a nearly 24% increase over this year's forecast results. Again, this is a preliminary estimate for next year subject to change, but it certainly looks like Calderoni and team are upbeat as progress on a vaccine is being made.  With a market cap currently at $9.5 billion, Anaplan stock trades for 21 times current-year expected sales and 17 times the preliminary forecast for next year. Given management's expected growth, shares look like a fair value to me. And if a vaccine means more economic normalization, I think Anaplan's actual results could be even better than projected. The company's balance sheet shows $297 million in cash and equivalents and no debt, a respectable war chest for the company to continue executing on its growth strategy. I remain optimistic on this cloud software vendor's prospects."

Some customers also want to extend the benefit of AWS Outposts to locations that may have constraints on space, power, or networking, or do not need a full rack of capacity. For example, retail stores may need to run their sales or security systems on-premises for low latency and local network access, but still want to aggregate inventory data and analyze customer behavior using data lakes and machine learning models running in an AWS Region. Other customers may have workloads that do not require a full rack of capacity, such as a hospital\u2019s patient portal, a product line-monitoring workload in a factory, or a telecommunications provider\u2019s 5G network management application. Also, for many of these use cases, customers may need to set up servers across hundreds or thousands of remote locations, which can take weeks or months. In all of these cases, customers then need to manage applications across servers, monitor health and performance of the applications and infrastructure, and ensure that the applications have the latest security patches, which is time-consuming and can impact application availability. AWS Local Zones expand to Boston, Houston, and Miami, with plans to launch 12 additional Local Zones across the US in 2021 AWS spans 77 Availability Zones within 24 geographic regions around the world, with announced plans for 15 more Availability Zones and five more AWS Regions in India, Indonesia, Japan, Spain, and Switzerland. The vast majority of customers get the necessary performance for their applications in public AWS Regions. However, for some of the more latency-sensitive and throughput-sensitive workloads (e.g. remote real-time gaming, machine learning inference, and live video streaming), customers want AWS infrastructure closer to their end-users. These latency-sensitive workloads have traditionally required customers to procure, operate, and maintain IT infrastructure in their own data center or co-location facility, adding cost and operational complexity. Customers also had to build and run these low latency application components with a different set of APIs and tools than the other parts of their applications running in AWS. Prior to today, customers could use AWS Local Zones in Los Angeles to deliver single-digit latency access to applications for end-users located in the Southern California area. However, customers outside of Southern California also want this capability for end-users in other cities across the US. \"Whether your organization has been all-in on the cloud since day one or is just beginning to move workloads to the cloud, all customers want to optimize for price performance,\" said Dave Brown, Vice President, EC2, AWS. \"As customers bring more and more workloads to the cloud, AWS continues to expand the industry\u2019s leading compute portfolio to meet their increasingly diverse needs. With the new EC2 instance types, AWS Outposts and AWS Local Zones options we\u2019re introducing today, we\u2019re providing customers with an unmatched breadth and depth of capabilities to help them innovate more cost-effectively, with the right compute for the right job.\" Datadog, Inc. is the monitoring and security platform for cloud applications. \"We\u2019re excited about the M5zn instances and the impact they can have on our high throughput compute and network intensive applications,\" said Rob Boll, Director, Runtime Platforms, at Datadog. \"Many of our compute intensive workloads will benefit from the improved performance per core, and with 100 Gbps networking throughput, we\u2019ll be able to pack workloads more efficiently onto fewer nodes. We expect to see significant infrastructure cost savings as we move our larger workloads over to M5zn instances.\" Ubitus is a cloud gaming technology leader. Through their platforms, users can enjoy a AAA gaming experience on any device including smartphones, tablets, gaming consoles, smart TVs, and computers as long as they\u2019re connected to a broadband network. \"We used AWS to partner with 505 Games to bring Control Ultimate Edition to a highly popular portable gaming device,\" said Wesley Kuo, CEO of Ubitus. \"With the new EC2 G4ad instances we have a lower cost structure, which will enable us to bring more games like Control Ultimate Edition to the mobile users globally.\" Netflix is the world's leading streaming entertainment service with over 190 million paid memberships in over 190 countries enjoying TV series, documentaries, and feature films across a wide variety of genres and languages. \"We have many artists and content creators who can benefit from bringing the on-premises infrastructure they use day-to-day to the cloud. However, every second counts, especially when it comes to the time it takes to compile and render 3D models and animations. For some time, we have wanted to move these artists' workstations to AWS in order to take advantage of the performance, elasticity, and cost benefits of the cloud. However, due to the interactive nature of these applications, our artists need very low latency access to their workstations to have a good working experience,\" said Nils Pommerien, Director, Cloud Infrastructure Engineering, Netflix. \"AWS Local Zones, which bring cloud resources closer to our artists, have been a game-changer for these applications. By taking advantage of access to AWS's highly performant and cost-effective compute resources, we have been able to migrate portions of our content creation process to AWS Local Zones, while ensuring an even better experience for artists.\" Mindbody is the leading technology platform for the fitness, wellness, and beauty industries. \"We have a portfolio of interdependent applications running in our existing on-premises data centers. We have been looking to move these workloads to the public cloud for some time. However, it is daunting to migrate such complex, interdependent applications to the cloud at the same time while ensuring a seamless experience for our end users,\" said John Strong, Senior Director of Production Engineering, Mindbody. \"AWS Local Zones have solved a significant problem for us here. We are using Local Zones to migrate our complex, legacy on-premises applications to AWS without an expensive revamp of our architecture. With a Direct Connect to Local Zones, we are able to establish a hybrid environment that provides ultra-low latency communication between applications running in the Local Zone and our on-premises installations. In turn, this has enabled us to migrate applications incrementally, simplifying our migrations drastically while reducing any business risk with on-going hybrid deployments.\" About Amazon Web Services About Amazon Contacts"

Over 99% of occupied stores had reopened by the end of the third quarter, and visitor traffic in September had essentially fully recovered despite fewer operating hours. Of course, a tough winter featuring increased pandemic restrictions and more retailer bankruptcies could hurt Tanger's results. But the company has plenty of liquidity to ride out the storm. Total liquidity sat at $640 million at the end of October, including $600 million of fully unused credit lines. No significant debt matures for Tanger until the end of 2023, and the company pays an average interest rate of just 3.6% on its existing debt. The current management team, led by CEO Lourenco Goncalves, inherited a mess of a company in 2014. The prior management team had taken on a \"growth at all costs\" strategy at the height of the Chinese commodity boom. As iron ore and steel prices started to decline, it left the company with a cornucopia of bad assets, a slag pile of debt, and was looking like it was days from bankruptcy. The steelmaking and iron ore business is a tough one. It is highly sensitive to economic output, its margins aren't super high, and it's capital intense. This new strategy has more than doubled the company's debt from its low point and turned free cash flow negative, as the company invests in its new operations and shoulders their debt. That said, Cleveland-Cliffs management has proved that it can deftly navigate a challenging industry and generate shareholder returns. Wall Street hasn't noticed this until recently -- shares are up more than 30% so far this year -- but there is still plenty of room for America's largest steelmaker to integrate its new businesses and generate returns.\u00a0 This will go down as a year to remember (or forget)!

(Photo: Business Wire) Supersonic aircraft require a precise combination of performance, structural stability, and safety that makes designing them both resource and time intensive. With an on-premises infrastructure, a design team would have to manage a large queue of design iterations running one after the other, to find the right balance. However, by tapping into the virtually unlimited scale of AWS HPC resources, Boom can run thousands of advanced computer simulations concurrently, far faster and more cost-effectively than ever before possible, resulting in an estimated 6x increase in productivity versus running these simulations in an on-premises environment. In order to refine its design, conduct stress tests, and simulate flight conditions for XB-1, Boom utilized more than 53 million compute hours on AWS with expectations to scale to more than 100 million compute hours in order to complete design and testing of its Overture airliner. By going all-in on AWS, Boom is able to leverage AWS\u2019s global infrastructure and unmatched portfolio of services to manufacture aircraft that meet security and compliance regulations while delivering on its commitment to sustainability. Boom plans to use AWS services, including capabilities in Internet of Things, machine learning, compute, storage, security, managed database, and analytics to build its 65-88-seat supersonic airliner and transform the flight experience for passengers. In addition, Boom\u2019s 525 terabyte repository of XB-1 design and testing data will be stored in AWS, along with its core IT applications which will streamline the company\u2019s operations so it can focus on innovation. Boom also plans to build a data lake for its manufacturing operations on Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), and use AWS IoT services including AWS IoT Core (a cloud service that lets connected devices easily and securely interact with cloud applications and other devices) to collect and process real-time data from its manufacturing equipment. Leveraging AWS analytics and machine learning services, Boom will gain deeper insights into its manufacturing processes to inform future decision-making, streamline workflows, and improve quality control. In addition to developing its state-of-the art aircraft design, which promises to be the next major innovation in high speed air travel since jet airplanes were introduced more than 60 years ago, Boom also plans for Overture to be the most passenger-centric airliner in the world by offering passengers superior comfort, tranquility, and productivity. To support this development, Boom is exploring how AWS IoT and machine learning solutions can be used inside the Overture cabin to reimagine the on-board experience for both passengers and crew, looking at ways to customize passenger messaging, deliver intelligent in-flight entertainment, create wearables for crew members, and improve on-time departure performance using live occupancy and equipment data. \"Boom is committed to making supersonic flight mainstream by leveraging improvements in technology, sustainability, and passenger experience. As we build the first supersonic airliner in a new age of travel, AWS, the world\u2019s leading cloud provider, will help us continuously refine our designs without compromise so that we can deliver a superior flight experience to the flying public,\" said Blake Scholl, Founder and CEO of Boom Supersonic. \"AWS\u2019s proven infrastructure and unparalleled portfolio of services are helping us deliver a revolution in air travel.\" \"Boom is taking a born-in-the-cloud approach to innovation and embracing the breadth, depth, and performance of AWS to reinvent commercial supersonic air travel,\" said Teresa Carlson, Vice President, Worldwide Public Sector and Regulated Industries at Amazon Web Services, Inc. \"We are thrilled to be collaborating with Boom to leverage the cloud to launch the next era of travel. By going all-in on AWS, Boom can innovate without bounds and more quickly than was previously possible, to make the world more accessible to everyone.\" About Amazon Web Services About Amazon About Boom Supersonic Contacts"

    "article_text":"(Bloomberg) -- Online shoppers in the U.S. spent $10.8 billion on Cyber Monday, missing Adobe Inc.\u2019s original projection by almost $2 billion, evidence that retailers pulled sales forward by offering deals earlier than usual. Still, the gusher of online spending was a record, rising 15% from 2019. \u201cCyber Monday continued to dominate the holiday shopping season, becoming the biggest online shopping day in U.S. history, despite early discounts from retailers,\u201d Taylor Schreiner, director of Adobe Digital Insights, said in a statement. \u201cThroughout the remainder of the holiday season, we expect to see record sales continue and curbside pickup to gain even more momentum as shoppers avoid crowds and potential shipping delays.\u201d Hot sellers included toys such as Lego sets and scooters, video games like Super Mario 3D All-Stars, and electronics including Apple AirPods, Hewlett Packard & Dell Computers and Chromecast, Adobe said. The pandemic-fueled stampede online was a valuable opportunity for retailers such as Amazon.com Inc., Walmart Inc., Target Corp., Best Buy Co., which had been preparing for the 2020 holiday deluge for months. There were occasional hiccups, but the industry\u2019s investments in delivery capacity and parking lot pickup helped get it through the Thanksgiving weekend and Cyber Monday. Black Friday spending of $9 billion also missed Adobe\u2019s forecast of $10.3 billion, another sign of cautious consumer spending during the pandemic and shoppers reacting to deals earlier in the holiday season. Amazon vacuumed up $1 of every $5 spent over the Black Friday weekend, the first time the Seattle-based giant accounted for the highest share of spending for the period, according to market research firm Numerator. But Cyber Monday will likely still be the peak, because many shoppers are conditioned to hold off on big purchases in anticipation of price cuts. Cyber Monday deals mostly weren\u2019t much better than Black Friday deals, said Kristin McGrath, editor at BlackFriday.com, which monitors web deals. Harkening back to traditional door-buster Black Friday tactics, many digital shops are likely to offer eye-popping discounts on popular products that usually sell out quickly to attract people to their site, hoping they linger and load up shopping carts with other things. \u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P."

    "article_text":"Among the online brokerage firms, Robinhood is certainly the one that gets the most media attention. Its appeal to younger investors, gives insight into what the next generation is interested in. Not surprisingly, tech and growth names lead the list of Robinhood's most popular stocks. While some of these have had great financial success, others show the exposure to speculation that this demographic of investors seem to be overly comfortable with.\u00a0 These are three stocks Robinhood investors are interested in, as of Nov. 27, 2020. \u00a0 This year has only helped the story. COVID-19, the subsequent economic shutdown, and social distancing all led consumers online to do more of their shopping. \u00a0\u00a0Names like Amazon, Walmart, and Target all had distinct advantages in comparison to smaller operations when it comes to maneuvering this kind of tumultuous event. After the shutdown ended, Amazon has continued to benefit from social distancing. Third quarter sales ended September 30. increased a whopping 37%.  Image source: Getty Images. The e-commerce titan recently launched its online pharmacy business in the United States, furthering the company's attempts to leverage price and online convenience to derive market share in new spaces. Not everything Amazon does always works, but if the company can offer a better deal in terms of pricing and convenience, it's hard to see Amazon Pharmacy not adding value to the company.  Accusations by short-sellers that the company's top executives were making investments in useless entities for profit led to a bit of chaos for Aphria. Since CEO Vic Neufeld stepped down, investors are more focused on sales and the bottom line. Revenue growth has been phenomenal. Estimates don't call for Aphria to start producing profitable earnings until 2023.  Of course, if estimates were always right, investing would be a pretty easy game. This is a situation where shareholders could see big returns if the company can shift to meaningful profitability, while avoiding overextending itself to do it. The company has expanded in Europe, serving as one of the main medical suppliers for Germany, with operations in other countries as well. The Sweetwater acquisition takes Aphria into something new. Of course, the desired integration in which Aphria can sell cannabis infused drinks, will be a tough sell in the U.S. for quite some time. Investors could be waiting a long time to see Aphria start making some real money.\u00a0 Disney (NYSE:DIS) has been an investment gem for a long time. Today, the company is at a crossroads. COVID-19 has ravaged its theme park business, resulting in a big financial headache. On the flipside, it's foray into streaming through Disney plus, Hulu, and its 21st century fox assets, have all benefited from social distancing. Finishing its fiscal year on October 3, Disney saw a 23% decline in revenues for the fiscal fourth quarter. The divided nature of their businesses, can be seen in the variations in growth. Media Networks were up 14% for the full fiscal year, while direct-to-consumer\/international revenues increased 81%; demonstrating the huge rise in Disney's streaming business. That subscription revenue wasn't enough to fend off the declines in parks\/experiences and studio entertainment, with revenue fallout of 37% and 13% respectively. In all, operating income from parks\/experiences shifted from $6.76 billion the year before, to a loss of $81 million in fiscal 2020. Studio entertainment operating income declined 7% to $2.5 billion. The stock is up since Disney reported earnings on Nov. 12, thanks to losses that were less than expected. Overall, there seems to be a blend of momentum between the overall market rally, combined with expectations that vaccines for COVID-19 will help Disney's parks business get back into the swing of it. Until that happens, Disney faces a tough situation."

The newest iteration of connected car services from the Waterloo, Canada-based company allows automakers to read vehicle sensor data coming off of equipment from multiple vendors, normalize that data and provide insights around the data for use either remotely or in vehicles. The IVY software system can run inside a vehicle's embedded systems, but configured from the cloud to let automakers providers drivers with features that can include indications about road conditions, driver performance, or battery use for electric vehicles. The BlackBerry toolkit can also make it easier for automakers to collaborate with a wider pool of developers to create new services around vehicle performance optimization, reduce maintenance costs and perform remote software updates on vehicles. Call it the potential for the Tesla-fication of a broad class of vehicles that use the service. \u201cData and connectivity are opening new avenues for innovation in the automotive industry, and BlackBerry and AWS share a common vision to provide automakers and developers with better insights so that they can deliver new services to consumers,\u201d said John Chen, Executive Chairman and CEO, BlackBerry, in a statement. \u201cThis software platform promises to bring an era of invention to the in-vehicle experience and help create new applications, services, and opportunities without compromising safety, security, or customer privacy.

Second, Alibaba generates all of its profits from its core commerce business, and its cloud business is unprofitable.

Therefore, Alibaba subsidizes the growth of its cloud platform with its e-commerce profits, while Amazon supports its e-commerce business with its cloud platform's profits.

However, Alibaba Cloud's adjusted EBITA margin gradually improved as economies of scale kicked in: Fiscal Year 2018 2019 2020 Adjusted EBITA Margin (6%) (5%) (4%) Source: Alibaba. In the first half of 2020, Alibaba Cloud's revenue rose 68% year over year to $4.01 billion as the COVID-19 crisis caused companies to ramp up their spending on cloud services to support their online platforms. It attributed that growth to robust demand from the internet, finance, and retail sectors, as well its growing penetration rate in China and ARPU (average revenue per user). Alibaba Cloud's operating loss widened year over year from $481 million to $820 million during the first half of the year, but its adjusted EBITA loss narrowed from $123 million to $73 million. CFO Maggie Wu also said Alibaba Cloud would \"definitely\" achieve \"profitability in the following two quarters,\" and it could eventually match the margins of \"other peer companies\" over the long term. Wu was presumably referring to Amazon, as most of Alibaba Cloud's other rivals are either unprofitable or don't disclose their cloud profits. However, Alibaba probably only expects Alibaba Cloud to turn profitable on an adjusted EBITA basis -- which excludes stock-based compensation, taxes, interest, and other variable expenses -- instead of a GAAP basis. AWS, by comparison, is firmly profitable by GAAP measures. Therefore, the underlying profitability of Alibaba Cloud might be improving, but investors shouldn't cheer until the segment's GAAP operating losses actually start to narrow."

Its cloud-native architecture offers three major service layers: Essentially, Snowflake customers feed massive sets of raw data into the cloud and receive back analytics-ready data, useful for distilling business insights and delivering revenue-generating services. With a highly scalable model that allows customers to pay per use, the company has proven exceedingly popular as more and more businesses turn to cloud-based warehousing solutions. Image source: Snowflake. In one year alone, Snowflake has more than doubled its number of customers, with existing customers increasing their usage significantly over time. Consequently, the company's revenue has increased rapidly, growing 121% year over year by the second quarter of fiscal year 2021. On a yearly basis, Snowflake experienced a 174% increase in revenue from fiscal year 2019 to 2020. And all of this is attributable to its competitive advantages. Despite this, Snowflake has a growing number of customers. Why? The company takes innovation and customer needs very seriously, consistently adjusting its offerings to accommodate where its competitors currently do not. Snowflake's competitive offerings include integration of diverse data types, massive scalability without sacrificing performance, simultaneous use cases and users, and extreme ease of use.\u00a0 Image source: Getty Images. Indeed, possibly its greatest competitive advantage comes from its easy-to-use platform and cloud-based architecture. Just as Shopify attracts businesses for its turn-key solutions, Snowflake's made-for-the-cloud platform entices businesses with its scalable, high-performance data-warehousing solution. However, as a company that runs on its competitors' public clouds, Snowflake exposes itself to some unique risks. Any outages or security issues will affect Snowflake as well. Furthermore, the company is extremely young, with a limited operating history, and therefore has very little data on which to forecast its future viability. It has also posted deepening operating losses, as the company experiences the costly growth spurt so typical of today's high-value tech stocks. Given this, from fiscal year 2019 to 2020, Snowflake has delivered net losses of $348 million, even though it boasts a gross profit margin of 61%. "

    "article_text":"Let's take a look at why JFrog freed up its locked-up shares ahead of schedule, why that decision caused its stock to drop, and whether or not it should influence our long-term view of this high-growth company. Image source: Getty Images. When JFrog went public in\u00a0September, it stated that 88% of its ordinary shares would remain locked up for 180 days. However, it also struck an agreement with its underwriters in which 25% of its shares could be unlocked if \"certain price and other conditions\" were met. Those exact conditions weren't publicly disclosed, but they likely required JFrog's stock to remain above a certain price and maintain adequate trading volumes before insiders could sell some of their shares. The agreement initially required JFrog to meet those conditions \"on or after\" Dec. 14. But that day coincides with JFrog's blackout period -- during which insider sales are banned -- ahead of its next earnings report. As a result, the date was moved up to Nov. 20, and 25% of the locked-up shares were freed up for public trading on Nov. 25. When JFrog's stock fell on Nov. 23, the decline wasn't caused by the actual lock-up release, which happened two days later. Instead, investors sold the stock on fears that insiders would dump their shares. However, the stock rebounded and actually rallied 12% on Nov. 25, so insiders weren't eager to take profits, even after the stock rose over 50% from its IPO price of $44 per share. Therefore, JFrog's leap on Nov. 25 is an encouraging sign, and suggests both insiders and retail investors are bullish on the stock's prospects. Large companies often install a wide range of software across different computing platforms and services, and manually updating that software is tedious, time-consuming, and prone to human error. JFrog's core product, Artifactory, stores those updates in a universal repository that can be accessed by any computing platform. It then automates those updates with its continuous software release management (CSRM) system. Image source: Getty Images. JFrog's streamlined approach is disruptive, and about 75% of the Fortune 500 companies now use its services. Its revenue rose 65% to $104.7 million last year, and it narrowed its net loss from $26 million to $5.4 million. In the first nine months of 2020, its revenue rose 46% year over year to $108.1 million, but its net loss widened from $5.2 million to $5.7 million. For the full year, it expects its revenue to rise 42%-43%. JFrog's business still looks healthy, but it faces competition from bigger companies like IBM's Red Hat, Amazon Web Services (AWS), and Microsoft's Azure. Its trailing 12-month net retention rate, which measures the year-over-year spending growth in its existing customers, also dipped from 142% at the end of 2019 to 136% at the end of the third quarter. In the end, JFrog's early lock-up release is really just short-term noise. It didn't dilute its existing shares like a secondary offering would, and the company's insiders didn't seem eager to cash out. There are still plenty of reasons to sell JFrog's stock, but it's futile to fret over lock-up periods."

    "article_text":"It's easy to look at a penny stock and be tempted. After all, you can buy a whole lot of shares when a stock trades for less than $5. And with just a $1 share-price increase, it could be a big winner. That's tempting. It's also dangerous. Stocks trading with such low share prices are usually cheap for a reason, and it's not a good one. Buying hundreds of shares might feel like a bargain, but it's important to remember that the number of shares isn't what matters. Your total investment is the number to focus on. Think of it this way: A 10% increase on a $1,000 investment means a $100 gain. Whether you own 1,000 shares or half a share, it's still a $100 gain. Image source: Getty Images. I know, I know. You were thinking penny stocks, and this company trades at more than $3,100 per share! Hear me out (and remember that you can buy fractional shares if needed). On top of Prime, here are two facts that make me optimistic as a shareholder: Amazon hired 350,000 full- and part-time employees in just four months during the third quarter and early in the fourth quarter. The company is preparing for what's expected to be huge holiday demand. These types of investments are expensive, but they build long-term value through customer loyalty and acquisition. Additionally, it only seems like everyone is buying everything online these days. They're not. E-commerce accounted for just 14% of U.S. retail sales in the third quarter, according to U.S. Census data. There's still substantial room for Amazon to grow in e-commerce. With Amazon Web Services and Amazon Advertising also driving growth, this company looks like a long-term market beater. First, Roku moved quickly in connected TV. That helped it build a massive subscriber base, with 46 million active accounts. While the company doesn't report total users, eMarketer estimated that there were more than 84 million in the United States (before the pandemic), making Roku the market leader in streaming TV platforms. Amazon's Fire TV is second and others are well behind. Roku's scale is a competitive advantage. Content providers want to be on the platform because that's where the viewers are. As more content comes onto the platform, it attracts more viewers. That cycle provides a powerful opportunity for future revenue growth, which brings me to the second big reason I like Roku: It's monetizing that huge user base through advertising. The company has been driving ad growth through the Roku Channel. It has also launched OneView, a platform that marketers can use to buy advertising \"programmatically\" -- using online software to target specific audiences instead of the traditional method of buying from advertising representatives. eMarketer estimates that U.S. ad spending on streaming platforms will more than double in the next four years, from $8.11 billion in 2020 to $18.29 billion in 2024. Roku is perfectly positioned to capitalize on that trend. DocuSign uses a land-and-expand business model -- land customers, then get them to expand spending. Its second-quarter results show that the strategy is working. (The third-quarter report will be released on Dec. 3.) DocuSign reported a record 120% dollar-based net retention rate, which means customers who were on the platform a year ago spent 20% more this year. The number of customers with an annual contract value of more than $300,000 increased 41% year over year to 520. Is there room for more growth? With a customer base that's grown 75% in two years to 749,000, DocuSign has a lot of expansion opportunities. Typically, that comes in additional use cases for eSignature within an organization. However, there's a longer-term growth story in the company's Agreement Cloud, which offers more than a dozen products. DocuSign's goal is to become part of their larger customers' infrastructure for managing agreements, from the start of the process to the end. A disappointing quarter could cause the stock price to temporarily fall, maybe steeply. While that may not happen, those types of moves can cause selling at the worst time. (I've been guilty.) By contrast, a long-term view allows a company to execute its strategies. I bought shares of Roku and DocuSign this month, and Amazon is one of the largest stock positions in my portfolio. I believe all three can provide market-beating returns for years."

BlackBerry and Amazon Web Services (AWS) said the new intelligent vehicle data platform, called IVY, will compress the time to build, deploy and monetize in-vehicle applications and connected services across multiple brands and models, making it easier for automakers to collaborate with a wider pool of developers to accelerate development of apps and services. Carmakers have been reluctant so far to share with outside technology providers much of the data generated by their vehicles. IVY is designed to complement and run simultaneously with new digital vehicle architectures developed by Volkswagen , General Motors and others. The platform is built on BlackBerry\u2019s QNX, a vehicle operating system in 175 million vehicles worldwide, according to John Wall, head of BlackBerry Technology Solutions. \u201cThe biggest challenge that most carmakers have in getting applications in the vehicle or monetizing their data is that there is no standardized way to access the data,\u201d Wall told Reuters. One goal of BlackBerry and AWS is to establish IVY as a standard platform across the auto industry, as Apple and Google have done in mobile phones through their iOS and Android platforms. Without that standardization, Wall said, automakers \u201ccan\u2019t really establish an ecosystem\u201d or leverage the broader community of app developers. IVY is expected to be installed on the first production vehicles in model year 2023, said AWS executive Sarah Cooper. BlackBerry and Amazon declined to say which companies will be the first to use IVY. (Reporting by Paul Lienert in Detroit Editing by David Goodman)"

    "article_text":"BlackBerry IVY will help automakers create personalized driver and passenger experiences and improve operations of cloud-connected vehicles with new BlackBerry QNX and AWS technology Today, Amazon Web Services, Inc. (AWS), an Amazon.com, Inc. company (NASDAQ: AMZN), and BlackBerry Limited (NYSE: BB, TSX: BB), a worldwide leader in intelligent security software and services, announced a multi-year, global agreement to develop and market BlackBerry's Intelligent Vehicle Data Platform, IVY. BlackBerry IVY is a scalable, cloud-connected software platform that will allow automakers to provide a consistent and secure way to read vehicle sensor data, normalize it, and create actionable insights from that data both locally in the vehicle and in the cloud. Automakers can use this information to create responsive in-vehicle services that enhance driver and passenger experiences. BlackBerry IVY will help automakers create personalized driver and passenger experiences and improve operations of cloud-connected vehicles with new BlackBerry QNX and AWS technology. (Graphic: Business Wire) BlackBerry IVY addresses a critical data access, collection, and management problem in the automotive industry. Modern cars and trucks are built with thousands of parts from many different suppliers, with each vehicle model comprising a unique set of proprietary hardware and software components. These components, which include an increasing variety of vehicle sensors, produce data in unique and specialized formats. The highly specific skills required to interact with this data, as well as the challenges of accessing it from within contained vehicle subsystems, limit developers\u2019 abilities to innovate quickly and bring new solutions to market. BlackBerry IVY will solve for these challenges by applying machine learning to that data to generate predictive insights and inferences, making it possible for automakers to offer in-vehicle experiences that are highly personalized and able to take action based on those insights. BlackBerry IVY will support multiple vehicle operating systems and multi-cloud deployments in order to ensure compatibility across vehicle models and brands. It will build upon BlackBerry QNX\u2019s capabilities for surfacing and normalizing data from automobiles and AWS\u2019s broad portfolio of services, including capabilities for IoT and machine learning. BlackBerry IVY will run inside a vehicle\u2019s embedded systems, but will be managed and configured remotely from the cloud. As a result, automakers will gain greater visibility into vehicle data, control over who can access it, and edge computing capabilities to optimize how quickly and efficiently the data is processed. With BlackBerry IVY\u2019s integrated capabilities, automakers will be able to deliver new features, functionality, and performance to customers over the lifetime of their cloud-connected vehicles, as well as unlock new revenue streams and business models built on vehicle data. For instance, BlackBerry IVY could leverage vehicle data to recognize driver behavior and hazardous conditions such as icy roads or heavy traffic and then recommend that a driver enable relevant vehicle safety features such as traction control, lane-keeping assist, or adaptive cruise control. IVY could then provide automakers with feedback on how and when those safety features are used, allowing them to make targeted investments to improve vehicle performance. Additionally, drivers of electric vehicles could choose to share their car\u2019s battery information with third-party charging networks to proactively reserve a charging connector and tailor charging time according to the driver\u2019s current location and travel plans. BlackBerry IVY could also provide insights to parents of teenage drivers who may choose to receive customized notifications based on insights from vehicle sensors when the number of passengers in the vehicle changes, when the driver appears to be texting, distracted, or not observing speed limits, or when the vehicle occupancy level rises above the parents\u2019 desired safety threshold. Similarly, parents of infants could receive a reminder to engage the child safety lock when the vehicle detects a child in the rear seat. BlackBerry IVY will enable automakers to compress the timeline to build, deploy, and monetize new in-vehicle applications and connected services across multiple vehicle brands and models. Instead of investing in one-off solutions that conform to the unique engineering of different vehicle models (as they do today), automakers using BlackBerry IVY will be able to leverage different types of data as common building blocks for new services that could work across a range of models. Automakers will be able to use the platform\u2019s application programming interfaces (APIs) to share data and outputs with their software development teams, giving them the ability to innovate, while also protecting customer privacy and security by controlling whom can access vehicle and app data and at what level of detail. In addition, BlackBerry IVY will make it easier for automakers to collaborate with a wider pool of developers to accelerate creation of new offerings that deliver improved vehicle performance, reduced costs for maintenance and repairs, and added convenience. For instance, by analyzing real-time performance data, automakers could recognize the first signs of potentially faulty parts, deploy code to identify affected vehicles, notify impacted drivers, and perform targeted recalls. Automakers will be able to remotely deploy and update the software from the platform\u2019s Cloud Console (a web interface for managing BlackBerry IVY) to continuously improve the functionality of the system. \"Data and connectivity are opening new avenues for innovation in the automotive industry, and BlackBerry and AWS share a common vision to provide automakers and developers with better insights so that they can deliver new services to consumers,\" said John Chen, Executive Chairman and CEO, BlackBerry. \"This software platform promises to bring an era of invention to the in-vehicle experience and help create new applications, services, and opportunities without compromising safety, security, or customer privacy. We are pleased to expand our relationship with AWS to execute this vision and deliver BlackBerry IVY.\" \"AWS and BlackBerry are making it possible for any automaker to continuously reinvent the customer experience and transform vehicles from fixed pieces of technology into systems that can grow and adapt with a user\u2019s needs and preferences,\" said Andy Jassy, CEO of Amazon Web Services, Inc. \"Through this joint effort with BlackBerry, we will provide automakers with the insights, capabilities, agility, and speed they need to thrive in an increasingly connected world. As automakers seek to race ahead in their digital transformations, BlackBerry IVY empowers them to build their brands and set the standard for connected vehicle services across the automotive industry.\" About Amazon Web Services For 14 years, Amazon Web Services has been the world\u2019s most comprehensive and broadly adopted cloud platform.

    "article_text":"The state of the global retail industry has been in flux because of e-commerce for over a decade, and those trends accelerated in 2020 because of the pandemic. Given new consumer behavior that is emerging as a result, e-commerce looks like a secular growth movement that has many years left ahead of it. Two trends within the larger digital retailing landscape that have my attention as 2021 nears are emerging markets and luxury e-commerce. Image source: Getty Images. The historically conservative and traditional luxury market is another corner of the retail world that has been stubborn on the digital front. Many individual high-end brands have launched their own direct-to-consumer sites, but this is an area that still relies heavily on in-person sales and physical storefronts. COVID-19 obviously necessitated some changes. Besides a general migration of luxury to the internet, some other developments could work in favor of high-end retail. Because of changing circumstances related to remote work and moves to less expensive suburban and rural areas, many consumers in the U.S. have more cash than ever. Many of them are finding themselves in need of fewer clothes than pre-pandemic -- but might consider higher-quality options in lieu of quantity. Emerging markets and luxury e-commerce are both, on average, behind the curve as the world enters a new digital era, and there are many small players on the field that could become a dominant force in the decade ahead. As 2020 draws to a close, it's these smaller stocks I'm shifting my attention to. If you join me, remember that with high growth comes high stock price volatility. Stay diversified (don't bet the farm on one name), think long-term (years rather than months or quarters), and keep those positions small so you're able to purchase more over time -- perhaps on a quarterly basis."

    "article_text":"We now have just 30 full days left before we ring in a new year. I'm pretty certain most folks will be glad to put 2020 in the rearview mirror. That includes Wall Street professionals and retail investors who've been whipsawed by extraordinary levels of volatility over the past nine months. However, periods of heightened volatility are usually blessings in disguise for opportunistic investors with long-term mindsets. Even with the benchmark S&P 500 at an all-time high, investors can still buy into great companies at fair valuations. Here are three top stocks perfectly set up to make investors richer in December and well beyond. Image source: Getty Images. Cresco generated $128.5 million in sales in 2019. Wall Street is now looking for $477 million in full-year sales this year, over $800 million in 2021, and for the company to decisively push into recurring profitability by next year. It has all the markings of a long-term winner in the pot industry and should be scooped up by growth-seeking investors in December. Image source: Getty Images. Without getting too technical, mortgage REITs borrow capital at short-term rates and buy assets with a higher long-term yield. In Annaly's case, we're talking about purchasing mortgage-backed securities (MBS). The difference between the yield generated from these MBSs and the short-term borrowing rate is known as the net interest margin (NIT). The wider the NIT, the more money Annaly makes -- and the more the company makes, the higher its annual payout. Furthermore, Annaly predominantly purchases agency-only assets. This means its MBSs are backed by the federal government in the event of default. Although the yields on agency-only MBSs are lower than non-agency assets, the perceived safety of agency assets has allowed Annaly to use leverage to its advantage. Image source: Getty Images. Walgreens has identified approximately $2 billion in annual expenditures that it plans to cut by or before 2022, all while reinvesting heavily in digitization. This should result in double-digit online sales growth and increased mobile pick-up order usage."

The FAANG stocks are one of the biggest gainers this year due to the benefits of stay-at-home. As the market keeps an eye on the COVID-19 vaccine developments, it rotates out of the stay-at-home stocks into the cyclical stocks that would benefit from the economy's reopening. \"There are some stocks that become a lot less attractive when the world goes back to normal, but not FAANG,\" Cramer said. He called FAANG stocks in-charge of their destinies, unfazed from the economic downturn. White House leadership or the vaccine timeline does not affect these companies as they are not cyclical. Facebook:\u00a0The management has changed its narrative from a profit-seeking company to a product-based company helping small and medium-sized businesses affected by the pandemic. Cramer said that many executives had told him that advertising on Facebook gives the best bang for the buck, and it is a bargain for small- and medium-sized businesses. Cramer said Facebook has a great defense if regulators turn in on the company as it has become essential for small and medium business. The social media giant can also move into the payments space. Facebook gained 5% in November. Apple:\u00a0Analysts are bullish on Apple, citing the strength of the latest iPhone 12. Cramer reiterated that Apple's service revenue stream keeps growing and is still in infancy as Apple has the most loyal customer base. According to Cramer, the rapidly declining dollar is bullish for Apple and the next year's earnings estimates are low. Cramer said that Apple does not get enough credit for the wearables. \"They own the wearables space,\" he added. Cramer said that Apple should be valued like a tech company instead of a consumer packaged goods company. Alphabet:\u00a0Google parent Alphabet keeps growing, be it YouTube monetization or Google Cloud services. Once the vaccines are out and travel opens, Alphabet becomes an advertisement play.\u00a0 \"FAANG stocks are not going anytime soon,\" if you ask Cramer.

    "url":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/bank-deliver-groceries-meals-too-090726522.html",
    "article_text":"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Russia\u2019s most valuable listed company is testing the limits of corporate reinvention. Traditional lenders everywhere are adding payments apps and digital banking offerings to see off tech upstarts. State-owned giant Sberbank PJSC wants to go much further to become Russia\u2019s answer to Amazon, Alibaba, Tencent and, well, Sberbank \u2014 all rolled into one. Watching long-time boss Herman Gref address investors this week in the Silicon Valley uniform of jeans, t-shirt and white trainers on a circular stage against a changing virtual background, it was hard to imagine this was once the Soviet savings monopoly, a monolith better known for bureaucracy and sullen service than tech prowess. In September, it dropped the word \u201cbank\u201d from corporate branding. Now, it aims to become one of the top three e-commerce players nationally by 2023 \u2014 delivering groceries and more alongside its regular banking, wealth management and insurance business. The logic isn\u2019t hard to understand. Facing limits on its reach abroad and low interest rates that could weigh on margins for years, Sberbank wants to make more of its clout at home, where almost two-thirds of Russians are clients. Rival state-owned lender VTB Group too has diversified, expanding into grain trading. Yet by stretching into everything from cloud services to food delivery, taxis and even in-house hardware, Gref is pushing not just Sberbank\u2019s aspirations, but what Moscow overseers will allow. Oversight questions are growing, and political risk is building too. Even if everything goes as planned, conglomerates often trade at a discount, suggesting they rarely deliver the value they should. Sberbank has already seen a remarkable transformation even before this effort to compete head-to-head with the likes of its one-time partner Yandex NV. Over more than a decade under Gref, a liberal reformer and former economy minister, the bank has bolstered its bottom line, revived its operating systems and branch networks, weathered European and U.S. sanctions, and now a pandemic. Impressive, even if it has had to delay a 1 trillion-ruble ($13 billion) net profit target. Sberbank\u2019s banking app is the third most popular in Russia, as measured by monthly users, according to Gref. Clients are interacting with the lender more frequently. That\u2019s good news, given engagement is a vital ingredient for any superapp-in-waiting. There\u2019s the benefit of an extensive branch network too, in a vast country where actually making the deliveries has been a major brake on internet shopping. Yet a state bank isn\u2019t necessarily the right owner for many of these businesses. Yes, the race is open for online shopping dominance in Russia, a country where few international tech heavyweights have made headway. But e-commerce has a propensity to gobble up cash that may extend beyond the 4% of equity signaled by Sberbank for the three-year period. The bank has already spent some $2 billion on acquisitions and tech to build a non-banking business that includes online cinema Okko and media group Rambler. Despite Gref\u2019s reassurances otherwise, it\u2019s unclear the bank can expand swiftly on all of these fronts without adding risk to the financial business where Sberbank still has room to grow in everything from loans to insurance. After all, banking will still account for roughly 70% of net operating income in 2023. Conglomerates elsewhere offer cautionary tales. Russia\u2019s cautious central bank has already warned about the risk of creating new monopolies and fretted about the rapid expansion into non-financial services. That may well translate into tougher disclosures standards or capital requirements. Sberbank, after all, holds nearly half of Russia\u2019s retail deposits. It may have looked to Asian heavyweights for inspiration, but there it was big tech that drove the disruption, not the other way around. Most of those companies, like Grab or Gojek in Southeast Asia, have expanded through partnerships, rather than full ownership. The going hasn\u2019t been smooth either, as Ant Group\u2019s initial public offering showed.Finally, there\u2019s Kremlin risk. Russia wants and badly needs digital innovation, but state coffers need dividends too. Sberbank says it will pay out half its earnings, and any sign of that sum shrinking finance tech experiments may prove politically costly. So too will any slip-up that hurts consumers.Tech is necessary, tempting and potentially accretive. It can also prove a distraction, with economic uncertainty ahead, for a major lender that still has room to grow within financial services. Watching Sberbank has reminded me of a conversation I had a year or so ago with an Uber executive. When I asked why superapps weren\u2019t catching on faster outside Asia, he paused. Sometimes, he replied, just because you can, doesn\u2019t mean you should. This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.

He says the tech is sophisticated enough at this point to identify AI-generated text; as for the \"lowest-hanging fruit,\" he says it can easily spot when reviews or positive sentiments about a company are posted in an inorganic way, presumably published by click farms. (It also tracks fake upvotes.) Right now, Fakespot is free to use, including because every review a consumer enters into its database helps train its AI further. Down the road, the company expects to make money by adding a suite of tools atop its free offering. It may also strike lead-generation deals with companies whose products and reviews it has already verified as legitimate. Still, he says that \"ironically, a lot of [bad] reviews are from sellers who are angry that we've given them F grades. They're often mad that we revealed that their product is filled with fake reviews.\" As for how Fakespot moves past these to improve its own rating, Khalifah suggests that the best strategy is actually pretty simple. \"We hope we'll have many more satisfied users,\" he says, adding: \"No one else really has consumers\u2019 backs.\""

    "url":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/zoom-projects-revenue-top-analysts-214220541.html",
    "article_text":"(Bloomberg) -- Zoom Video Communications Inc. gave a revenue forecast for the current quarter that topped analysts\u2019 estimates but suggested a slight decline in its explosive growth, touching off concerns among investors that the software maker\u2019s pandemic boom may be coming to an end. Shares declined about 5% in extended trading. Revenue will be as much as $811 million in the period that ends in January, the San Jose, California-based company said Monday in a statement. Analysts, on average, projected $719 million. The company\u2019s sales guidance, at the high end, estimates a 330% increase from a year earlier -- a slight decline in the year-over-year growth from the previous two quarters. Zoom\u2019s projected slowing revenue expansion in the current period highlights investors\u2019 concerns that 2021 won\u2019t be as favorable for the software maker as this year, when the company gained customers forced to work and go to school remotely. Zoom\u2019s stock has jumped sevenfold thus far in 2020, heightening questions about whether the company is overvalued. Wall Street has fawned over the company for its accelerating sales growth, but analysts have raised questions about how long it might last. Investors also may be disappointed by cost issues. The company reported adjusted gross margin of 68.2% in the fiscal third quarter, compared with 82.9% in the same period a year earlier and 72.3% in previous period. Analysts had expected 71.8%. Zoom said the margin decline was due to expenses associated with public cloud services and supporting non-paying users. Executives said investors should expect similar numbers into the next fiscal year before the gross margin starts to improve. Zoom said sales increased 367% to $777.2 million in the quarter, which ended Oct. 31. Profit, excluding some items, was 99 cents a share. Analysts projected revenue of $693.4 million and adjusted profit of 75 cents. Zoom\u2019s stock has become a barometer of the pandemic economy, rising when Covid-19 lockdowns emerge and falling on good news about vaccines. Chief Executive Officer Eric Yuan has tried to diversify Zoom\u2019s capabilities for large enterprises, small- and mid-sized businesses and individuals so the company can grow after the coronavirus is controlled and greater numbers of workers return to their offices. The software maker in October announced OnZoom, a platform for hosting paid classes, lessons and charity events. It also debuted Zoom Apps, a way to more tightly integrate Zoom with other applications used during video conferences. Zoom named Amazon Web Services its preferred cloud provider, the Amazon.com Inc. unit said in a statement after Zoom\u2019s results. The companies have been partners since 2011, but Zoom has recently begun using Oracle Corp.\u2019s cloud as well. Separately, Zoom said that it would spend more on capital expenditures in the current period to boost its own data center capacity. Such a move could pare back the company\u2019s reliance on cloud services. Zoom said it had 433,700 customers with more than 10 employees at the end of the quarter and 1,289 contributing more than $100,000 in trailing 12-month revenue. Both figures topped analysts\u2019 average estimates, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. \u201cWe remain focused on the communication needs of our customers and communities as they navigate the current environment and adapt to a new world of work from anywhere using Zoom,\u201d Yuan said in the statement.

    "article_text":"AWS continues to be Zoom\u2019s preferred cloud provider to seamlessly grow its core video meeting platform and innovate new customer experiences using AWS\u2019s unmatched portfolio of services Today, Amazon Web Services, Inc. (AWS), an Amazon.com, Inc. company (NASDAQ: AMZN), announced that Zoom Video Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ: ZM) has selected AWS as its preferred cloud provider. The multi-year agreement extends the longstanding relationship between the two companies, enabling Zoom to rapidly scale its service on the world\u2019s leading cloud, rise to the challenges brought by the COVID-19 pandemic, and deliver reliable services and continuous innovation for its expanding base of corporate and individual customers. Zoom will continue to leverage AWS\u2019s global infrastructure and unmatched portfolio of services \u2013 including capabilities in compute, storage, content distribution, and security \u2013 to create a seamless, secure extension of its data centers. In addition, AWS and Zoom are collaborating to develop new solutions for Zoom\u2019s enterprise users, leveraging the breadth and depth of AWS to integrate Zoom services with Amazon devices and capabilities to make it easier for organizations to run hybrid office and remote work models. AWS has supported Zoom since 2011, and earlier this year when the COVID-19 pandemic began impacting businesses, schools, and governments around the world, Zoom expanded its relationship with AWS to keep up with surging demand as hundreds of millions of new Zoom participants began to use the platform for everything from online education to business meetings to social gatherings to exercise classes. Over the past year, Zoom has grown on AWS to accommodate an increase from 10 million daily meeting participants in December 2019 to more than 300 million a day regularly since April 2020. Beginning in February 2020, engineering teams from AWS and Zoom worked around the clock and across remote locations to securely and reliably meet the needs of this vast, globally dispersed user community, adding tens of thousands of Amazon Elastic Cloud Compute (EC2) instances (virtual servers) to Zoom\u2019s overall capacity, even adding thousands of instances in a day as usage demanded. With AWS, Zoom is ready to meet customer demand with low latency anywhere in the world, while continuously delivering new features that improve the Zoom user experience. Today, leveraging AWS, Zoom is able to seamlessly scale with global demand for its services. Zoom now provides video conferencing technology to more than 130,000 schools globally at no charge, as well as millions of families and individuals, in addition to the company\u2019s traditional enterprise-scale users \u2013 businesses, governments, healthcare and educational institutions, and other large organizations. Tied to its sudden growth, Zoom also faced sharply increased demand for customer service over the past nine months as new users adopted its platform. AWS provided Zoom with over 1,000 Amazon WorkSpaces virtual desktops to help the company manage an unprecedented increase in demand for help desk support while its employees work remotely during the pandemic. AWS also provided additional cloud infrastructure and security monitoring support to help Zoom successfully stream major events more securely, including nationally-televised sporting and entertainment events, standing up a dedicated threat intelligence team to monitor Zoom\u2019s AWS environments during the events. \"Faced with unprecedented global demand this past year, we\u2019ve been able to handle it in significant part by running the substantial majority of our cloud-based workloads on our preferred cloud provider, AWS, and relying on AWS\u2019s performance and scalability,\" said Eric S. Yuan, CEO of Zoom. \"Looking forward, we will continue to innovate alongside AWS to reinvent virtual collaboration and deliver secure and exciting experiences for our customers.\" \"COVID-19 changed everything for Zoom, putting demands on the company to meet the video conferencing needs of hundreds of millions of new participants around the globe, and AWS was there from the beginning to ensure Zoom could scale to meet these new requirements virtually overnight,\" said Andy Jassy, CEO of AWS. \"When organizations build on AWS \u2013 as Zoom has done since 2011 \u2013 they transform their business, expanding and innovating much faster. Together, Zoom and AWS have delivered great experiences for new Zoom users around the world, and we look forward to using the cloud to develop new ways to help the world communicate.\" About Amazon Web Services For 14 years, Amazon Web Services has been the world\u2019s most comprehensive and broadly adopted cloud platform. AWS offers over 175 fully featured services for compute, storage, databases, networking, analytics, robotics, machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), mobile, security, hybrid, virtual and augmented reality (VR and AR), media, and application development, deployment, and management from 77 Availability Zones (AZs) within 24 geographic regions, with announced plans for 15 more Availability Zones and five more AWS Regions in India, Indonesia, Japan, Spain, and Switzerland.

    "article_text":"John Lagering Mercari US CEO tells Yahoo Finance Live consumers are turning to reselling items during the pandemic in an effort to have more cash this holiday season. - It is Cyber Monday. We are seeing enormous shopping online. And, Adam, of course, we saw it all last week, too. Many people were shopping on Thanksgiving Day. We had big data from Adobe coming out. I want to bring in John Lagerling right now. He is the CEO for the US arm of Mercari. Now, Mercari-- I don't know, you're probably going to correct me, but I've been on the website-- it's a little bit like an eBay in there. It's a resale, but it's not so much an auction. And I want to know what you guys are seeing right now in terms of what people are buying, what people are doing. Because the heyday of eBay, in my Christmas experience, is when you need to get your hands on something that are not in any stores. And I feel like we're not seeing, like, a run on one item. Oh, there you are, John. JOHN LAGERLING: There we go. I thought I was swapped out for someone more skilled than me for a second there. [LAUGHTER] I'm glad I still have my job. I hope you can hear me well. - Good, we've got you. Yeah, like, there's no Tickle Me Elmo this year. So, like, resale, you'd think, is like the one thing everyone needs. And, yes, I just dated myself with that reference. But is there an item that I'm missing that's driving people to you? JOHN LAGERLING: Not really. I think people are still sticking with what will entertain them when they're forced to stay at home. So we still see a lot of interest for video games, and also home decor. So decorative pillows, artwork, posters, collectibles. Anything that you can do to kind of make your shelter-at-home experience more cozy seems to be still a big deal. - I'm trying to think of something about decorative pillows. Because there's an ad on TV right now where the couch has way too many pillows, and I always chuck at that. Because it seems like that's the regrettable purchase everyone makes. Like, ah, you've got too much stuff here. Is this all sustainable? We have huge amounts of money for people fortunate enough to have gotten a paycheck during this pandemic. Big savings. But there's a vaccine coming. Our world is going to come back. Are we going to see these kinds of big increases going forward, say, next holiday season? JOHN LAGERLING: I do think that what has happened with COVID-19 is that people have been forced to look at what can be done online. And now that they've found the convenience and, honestly, venues that weren't even available through retail-- Like, you can't go to a retail shop easily and sell something and some of your money back. I mean, you can return items. But a lot of people store new items they bought and never used at home. And there hasn't really been a good channel for that. So I think, for me, who's in the resale business, that's probably here to stay. Even for e-commerce, just straight out, I think the convenience that people feel of really getting the item and getting the item at a very good price, it's probably going to continue to be hard for retail to compete with what people now have discovered, similar to how people have realized that we can actually work from home and still get stuff done without meeting in person. So there are a lot of things where I don't think we can put the genie back into the bottle. - For Mercari, how many people are just regular people that are selling? Because sometimes I think, like, with eBay, or even with Poshmark, when it started, it was just more peer to peer. But then people realized they can make money. And then there's, like, these cottage industries that start up. And, I don't know, negotiating with them or what they have to offer is kind of different than just dealing with the one person. What are you finding is your vendor, your seller? Who are they? JOHN LAGERLING: So seller, if I'm going to you define her a little more specifically, it's typically, again, on average, female. Not there are one or two somewhere in America. This is not a coastal phenomena. It's not a Midwest phenomena. We've really seen, all over the country, that especially mothers with families and kids have a lot of items coming into the household and also the need of getting household items out that aren't useful anymore or that ended up not being used. So that trend has continued. That has not seen a change. What I would say is that we have done some surveying here, and we've seen that now it's about 46%, almost half of American consumers, have considered or are already selling things on these marketplaces that are consumer-powered. And I think that's an absolutely new trend that we've seen, obviously more than a doubling of that level of activity. We now have millions of sellers. And, yes, we have some very high-volume professional sellers. But there are a lot of regular folks out there that have discovered how easy it is to sell online, and especially for marketplaces like Mercari, where you don't have to meet up, but everything ships. - I'm glad you talked about people getting rid of stuff that's just cluttering up the house, because trading cards are a hot item, and Pok\u00e9mon cards. I can't think of anything that would be clutter more so than Pok\u00e9mon cards. And yet, big seller on the site, right? JOHN LAGERLING: Well, maybe mentally cluttering, right? Because I think items are not just their physical space. They're also, kind of, their emotional space, or even your guilt space. Sometimes you ended up buying something that you didn't go and use, or you used it and you're done with it. You already, you know, beat your friends at that Pok\u00e9mon game. It's time to trade in for something else. And Pok\u00e9mond cards have actually, as a growth category, year on year, compared to 2019, has grown by 554% on Mercari, which is really not being beat by anything. It's really the number one category. Previous years, Funko POP!'s, which are these collectable little figures, were a huge category. Still growing. But I think the five to six X of Pokem\u00f3n is quite astronomical. - Well, I guess we know we're not going to get Adam those for Christmas. [LAUGHTER] JOHN LAGERLING: No Pok\u00e9mon cards for you, Adam. [LAUGHTER] - No, no, no. - No Pok\u00e9mon. Forget it. - Used Studebaker parts, I'll take. JOHN LAGERLING: Well, at least you know where to get them. - John Lagerling is Mercari US CEO, talking to us about how they're doing this holiday season. Thanks so much. JOHN LAGERLING: Thank you so much. Have a fun Cyber Monday for everyone. Take care."

    "article_text":"Kristen Gall Rakuten President discusses the success of Black Friday and what to look out for when it comes to Cyber Monday deals. - Let's bring in Kristin Gall. She is Rakuten president, joining us now because we're seeing some trends that-- I hate the term, \"the new normal,\" So let's just say, here to stay and not going back. What's the biggest of those trends? And welcome to the program. KRISTEN GALL: Thank you so much. Happy Cyber Monday to you both. It is indeed an unprecedented Cyber Monday. It could potentially be the biggest online shopping day that we've ever seen in our lives. There are some interesting trends that are happening. We've actually seen trends that started in the beginning of COVID that are really continuing into this Cyber Monday. So the world of you being at home and the world of what you need at home was how consumers were shopping over the summer. And in terms of what that looks like right now, that looks like the same categories that have been trending up, really all fall. So electronics are huge. We're seeing a huge uptick in people buying laptops and air pods. Gaming has been tremendous. Walmart keeps releasing inventory in Xboxes and it nearly crashes their site every single time. Toys has had a double-digit upswing. LEGO has had to actually throttle the traffic to their site because it's been so popular this year. And then in terms of apparel, you know, we've seen a mixed bag in department stores and luxury retailers. And the people who are really winning are companies that are selling athleisure and sneakers. So the Nikes and the Adidas of the world, Lululemon, we're really seeing-- you know, the tastes of America are changing right now in terms of what they need. And we're seeing, you know, retailers respond to that. But the winners are really-- it's the sort of more pandemic-appropriate retailers. - So we keep hearing that, you know, it's the biggest Cyber Monday and Black Friday. And, like, obviously it is. Right? This number gets bigger every year and now we're in a pandemic and people aren't going shopping. So this number, of course was always going to be big. What I'm trying to figure out and slice at a little bit mole is, what is the marginal increase do you think? I mean, look, if we didn't have the pandemic, we knew this was already going to be the biggest online shopping day, because every year we keep adding. So what is the marginal increase you think that we're seeing? KRISTEN GALL: I mean, I would say it's upwards of 50% to 70% in some cases. I think, you know, based on what we would have forecast before, we would have probably ticked up Cyber Monday by about 20%. It's going to be significantly larger than that. And obviously we're still kind of in the middle of it. But, you know, in general it's two things. It's people are still buying their gifts online, and the people who normally would have bought them in stores are buying them online as well. And then it's still, our day to day necessities are being bought online also. So, you know, pet companies, Petco, Chewy, all of those sort of pet-oriented retailers are also having a huge spike in traffic as well. Because you still have your necessities that you need to buy. Marketplaces are still super important. So Target and Walmart, you know, 100% winning. But it's the amalgamation of all of those things. Your necessities and your gifts are all being bought online that are really contributing. - Are you surprised by the fact that-- I think you pointed out, there's been a surge in purchases of sneakers. You'd expect the electronics, but beauty supply stuff. It's not as if-- I mean, guys on stream wear makeup. Guys who walk the street wear makeup these days. But who's wearing makeup, because no one's going to the office, right? KRISTEN GALL: I mean, the interesting thing that we've seen is that we've seen an uptick in, you know, things that you use to take care of yourself and, you know, pampering yourself at home. You're not traveling. You're not going out to dinner. So, you know, I mean, I know in, you know, war-time England sales of lipstick went up significantly. I kind of liken it to that, where it's like a little thing that you can do for yourself to make you feel better. We've seen a lot of beauty brands really, really doing very well. Brands like Glossier who-- they were already swinging up in the market already and they've had double to triple-digit increases. And then big retailers like Ulta and Sephora are doing well too. So I do think there's this notion of pampering yourself, pampering the people that you're buying gifts for. You know, it's something that you can do at home to make yourself feel a little bit better. - We wish you a happy Cyber Monday and go shop. And we want to thank you for joining us, Kristin Gall, Rakuten president. KRISTEN GALL: Thank you. - Good to have you here."

    "article_text":"Stocks fell Monday as investors gave back some of last week\u2019s gains, which sent the S&P 500 and Nasdaq to fresh record highs and the Dow above 30,000 for the first time ever. Katie Nixon of Northern Trust Wealth Management and Vance Howard of Howard Capital Management joined Yahoo Finance Live to discuss. ADAM SHAPIRO: We've got three minutes to the closing bell. We want to invite into the stream Katie Nixon, Northern Trust Wealth Management, as well as Vance Howard. He's CEO at-- PM at Howard Capital Management. Good to have you both here. Jared Blikre also on deck. Katie, let me start with you. As we head into the closing bell, three P's you say people should pay attention to-- politics, policy, and the pandemic. Let me just ask you about the pandemic. Is that now rearview mirror and priced in? KATIE NIXON: Partly priced in, I think. But I do think, as we see continued good news on the rollout of the vaccine, the market will continue to react positively to that. So although I think a lot of the initial vaccine news is priced in, I think as we see the implementation, we'll get some more bumps. JEN ROGERS: Vance, the market's not perfect. Sometimes we overshoot to the downside. Other times, we overshoot to the upside. Do you think that we're in one of those moments right now, where we may have gotten a little bit ahead of ourselves, a little bit over our skis right now? VANCE HOWARD: No, not at all. We trade the HCM byline. So we're a mathematically driven shop. The math is pointing to us that we may have another 4% or 5% upside in December alone before the end of the year. The HCM byline is extremely positive right now. Being a quantitative measure that it is, it's usually been very, very accurate. We see the market pushing higher or even into the first and second quarter of 2021. Yeah, there's going to be some bumps in the road. There are bumps in the road in every single market that we have. So any pullback that we see in the market we see as a buying opportunity. ADAM SHAPIRO: Let's go to Jared Blikre as we get ready for that closing bell because, Jared, this has been a really terrific month despite what appears to be a down day today. One day does not a market make. JARED BLIKRE: That's right. And it is the last day of the month. Normal to see selling when we have the markets up this much. You look at the Dow. It's up 11.7% for the month. NASDAQ has some nice gains, a little bit less, 11.6%. S&P 500 sitting on 10 and 1\/2%. And a lot of these are setting some pretty big milestones. It's going to be the best month for the S&P 500 since 1987. So not too shabby right there. We are seeing some profit taking, especially in crude oil and the energy market. Now we've seen energy up. This is the second best month we've ever seen for energy, coming off a little bit today. I do want to note the US dollar index has been especially weak. If we take a look at a three-month chart here, interesting candle. This is called a hammer candle. Not final until we get confirmation the next day. But if this is an interim low, got to keep in mind that rising dollar could pressure equities in early December. But we just do have these incredible tailwinds at our back from the December seasonality, the so-called Santa Claus rally at the end of the month into the first few trading days of January. So just taking a look at the NASDAQ 100 here, we can see some pretty good leadership, at least for Apple. That's up 2 and 1\/2%. The other majors, big mega cap names, those are down. Google's off about 1.76% here. Amazon is off about 1%. Facebook off about 20 basis points. Tesla was in the green. Now off about 3% for the day, but nice gains for the month. Here's the closing bell. [BELL] JEN ROGERS: That's going to be good for November. Wow, the whole month now in the books, as we've been just going through the numbers here, looking at the Dow for our best November since 1928. You do have to remember, it was down today. On the day today, energy our worst performing sector, red across the board, except for the XLK. These are the S&P sectors, looking like it's going to eke out the smallest of gains, up just about 7\/10. Also, S&P 500, NASDAQ, best month since April 2020. So the story here, we've had rotation. We've had re-opening trade. We've had optimism on the political situation here in the US as well. And of course, who can forget the repeated Mondays of news on the vaccine front. And again, today we had more news coming out from Moderna. I want to bring in Katie Nixon with Northern Trust Wealth Management just to get a little bit of perspective here on all of this as we wrap up this month right now. We're heading into December. It's usually, seasonally, it can be a strong time. You know, just not that long ago, we were saying that we needed stimulus to see anything like this, right? That was the story early in the fall. Stimulus, stimulus, stimulus. Now what happens? Do we need something out of Congress by the end of the year? We're starting to hear some news reports this afternoon that McConnell wants to maybe get something through the end of the year. To continue this rally, do we need Washington? KATIE NIXON: Right, so I think this is an important time to distinguish between the market and the economy. I think right now, it's very clear that the market is sort of looking past what is going to be a difficult couple of months, regardless of fiscal stimulus. We're going to have probably more rolling lockdown lights here in the US to try to continue to control the coronavirus. But the market's really firmly focused on 2021, I think. The good news on the vaccine front that you've covered I think is giving investors a lot of optimism. Now would fiscal stimulus be an additional support for the market? Of course. And we do expect there to be a smaller, targeted, more tactical package probably passed either during the lame duck or soon, after the inauguration. But I don't think it's necessary at this point that we get a fiscal package in order to maintain the market rally. ADAM SHAPIRO: Vance, gotta give you credit. Back in February, you went 60% into cash. Now you are 100% in equities. Is that a little dangerous perhaps? VANCE HOWARD: Well, that's what we do for a living. You know, Katie made a good point. There's a difference between the economy and the stock market. Those are two different animals doing two different things. Clearly, that's become the norm history wise. But again, the byline gave us a sell in February. We moved 60% to cash. It gave us a solid buy the first week of April. We were 100% back in the market in the second week of April, which, you know, the byline's mechanical. It's not emotional. It's repeatable. We take the emotion out of the equation because I don't know what the stock market's going to do tomorrow. And I don't know what the economy's going to do tomorrow. So I could take that out of the equation and trade math. And that's been a great trade force. Clearly, any pullback we've had since April, we've been buying into. And into what Katie said, you know, there's a big difference between the economy, which the economy is not doing well. With the stock market, if you're playing different sectors like a large cap growth, you're having a great year. JEN ROGERS: Jared Blikre, back to you. Energy, last time, when we had talked on the three, wasn't down this much, ending the day off more than 5%, 5.4% here. The month, though, a different story. Give us some of the wrap-up on the month. JARED BLIKRE: Sure thing. Let's go straight to the YFi Interactive. This is our sector heat map. And you can see on the bottom right, we've got energy down 5 and 1\/2% today. And the leader today tech and healthcare. But you look at what's happened over the month. Energy is still the clear standout. Now it's up 28% in the upper left there, followed by financials, industrials and materials, and then tech. Tech still outperforming here, the S&P 500. It just gives you a sense that we have really outperformed, and we have this broad-based leadership, which is necessary to build a long-term secular bull market. It doesn't mean it has to happen overnight. And anything can happen in the coming weeks and days. But the groundwork is being laid here. So let's take a look at some of our canaries, some of our sentiment market leaders. And you see in the forefront here, MJ. That's the cannabis ETF, up 47%, nearly 50% for the month. And then the IPO market has been extremely hot. The Renaissance IPO ETF, IPO ticker, up 25% month to date. And then you have solar. That's the TAN ETF. Bets-- that's betting-- that's a gambling ETF. XRT is retail. Then you have SOX. That's a chip index. And that has been making record highs, along with XRT. So you have this broad-based real-- excuse me. You have this broad-based rally here. You throw in regional banks and the transports. A lot of these markets are making record highs, and it just bodes as to the-- or says that the market is strong right now. And just give you a couple more spaces here. Look at the cannabis space. Incredible gains for the month. You look at Aurora Cannabis, that's up 188%. And also the work from home trade not to be sneezed at. Even though we lost some of its shine this month, we still see Slack technology is up 67%, a lot of that having to do with the expected Salesforce buyout out of it. Guys. ADAM SHAPIRO: Katie, what should investors make of two very important things you point out? First that with these markets, it could be too much too fast because that's rarely a good thing. And the other, we keep talking about fiscal stimulus, but it could be too little too late. What should we investors make of all that? KATIE NIXON: Right, so on the fiscal side, with the vaccine coming, the fiscal stimulus becomes a bit less important to investors. However, there is a risk as we see some of the market, some of the economic indicators, rather, soften, whether it's on the manufacturing side or certainly on the employment front, that we don't get a fiscal bridge that's strong enough or long enough to sustain the economy through the next couple of months. So that certainly is a risk. And on the other front, you know, optimism is a great thing. There's a lot of optimism and a lot of bullishness in the market right now. As you referenced, having a broader market participation is certainly a very healthy sign. But there is a danger that we get overly optimistic at this period of time. And we're certainly seeing retail investor surveys like the AAII survey, other options-based data, show us that investors are pretty bullish now, which doesn't really mean anything in isolation, but it does present a little fragility to the market in terms of being able to withstand any bad news. JEN ROGERS: Vance, I'm just curious on Katy's point there, just about optimism. And usually, if I asked this question, somebody will say, oh, Jen, you can't time the market. But that's what you do. You move to cash, and you did well. So what signs are you looking for that would make you make a move like that again? What are the signals that you're looking at? VANCE HOWARD: Right, like I said, the HCM byline is, it's the backbone of our whole company. We've been trading it for 25 years now. It served us well. We sidestepped 2000, 2002. We sidestepped 2008. But you got to trade what's actually happening. And the market's going up. I mean, that's just what's happening. I don't know what the market's going to do next week or next year. All I've got is a guess, like anybody else. But what I do has a quantitative measures. And our quantitative measures are clearly pointing this market's going higher. The bulls have control. You know, the Dow Jones just hit an all-time record high last week, which is what we call a Christopher Columbus Day. It means that that's territory that's never ever been seen before. New highs are telling you something on major indexes that selling it, there's a lot of buying power out there. We're sitting on a record amount of cash. We're sitting on 1, 5, 10-year treasuries that are barely paying any interest. There's a tremendous amount of fuel in the engine they can push this market higher. But again, the HCM byline is positive. As long as it's positive, we're 100% in. ADAM SHAPIRO: Just remember, Vance, Christopher Columbus almost got slaughtered by the people when he got to their world. We appreciate your being here, Katie Nixon, Northern Trust Wealth Management, as well as Vance Howard, CEO and PM at Howard Capital Management. All the best to you both."

    "url":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/video\/companies-not-people-not-protecting-211002726.html",
    "article_text":"Scott Galloway, NYU Professor of Marketing and Author of 'Post Corona: From Crisis to Opportunity', joined Yahoo Finance Live to discuss his new book and his thoughts on big tech regulation. JEN ROGERS: I don't know if you heard me earlier, but I was saying you really threw a wrench in my day by having me read this book early. It's, uh-- it's, uh-- I guess I was going to say it's easy, but that makes it sound simple, but it's kind of like a page turner and it's what we talk about all the time. SCOTT GALLOWAY: Oh, thanks. JEN ROGERS: \"From Crisis to Opportunity\" though, what I get-- like, sometimes I'm reading it and I think this is OK, like it's going to turn out all right. We have the potential here to actually be better than we were before as a country, as a human race. And then I think, but wait, are we actually going to be able to take advantage of this opportunity? Are you optimistic given-- let's just talk about America-- how divided we are, income inequality, that we will be able to seize this opportunity for change here? SCOTT GALLOWAY: I think that's the correct question. And look, I've got to be honest, I'm a glass half empty kind of guy. And I would argue that we probably would have been better off the last 6 or 12 months listening more to the pessimists and less to the optimists. So I think our optimism as a nation and our view of exceptionalism has unfortunately morphed into an arrogance that's been a comorbidity. We've had more time to prepare for this. We spend more money on health care. We think of ourselves as being innovative. And we sit here today with record hospitalizations, and 5% of the world's population, and 25% of the infections and deaths. The Chinese word for crisis is risk and also juncture. It tries to combine those two meanings. And I do believe there are huge silver linings coming out of this pandemic, but it's not a default setting. America isn't-- you know, isn't what it is. It's what we make of it. And I would argue that we will look back on this moment either as having been, you know, what Vonnegut said that one step in the wrong direction, a step back, is a right step or this could be the signal or the juncture where we really turned down. I think it's up to us. There are some huge silver linings, but a default position that without sacrifice, without leadership that everything is going to turn out right so far I would argue the trajectory here is a negative one. ADAM SHAPIRO: You actually talk about several different issues. And I was, before we introduced you, talking about one of the things-- kind of the self-fulfilling prophecy when we talk about the weak get stronger. I think this is a portion of the book-- or rather the strong get stronger and the weak get weaker. Big tech got stronger and we use Tesla as the example. We keep talking about how wonderful Tesla is. That reinforces the belief that Tesla is wonderful. People buy the stock. Their borrowing costs are lower, and they can keep going forward. Are we setting ourselves up for a big fall? SCOTT GALLOWAY: Well, there's just examples everywhere. It took Apple 42 years to get to a trillion dollars and it took them five months to get to $2 trillion. Tesla's standing here in March was the fourth most valuable automobile company. Now, they're the most valuable and worth more than two, three, and four-- Daimler, Toyota, and Volkswagen-- combined. And we don't like to say this out loud, but I feel as if this pandemic has largely been invented when we're taking the top 10% into the top 1% and taking the rest of the 90% downward. There was a study by the Robin Hood Foundation that came out today that said 32% of people in New York have been forced to go to a food bank because of food insecurity since the beginning of the pandemic. So think about this, Adam. You're just as likely in New York State right now-- what we think of as the capital or, you know, the state that sort of embodies America-- you're just as likely to run into someone on the street who's had to go to a food bank than someone who has a college degree. So while, you know, we have flipped the script, if you will, capitalism is meant to be full-body contact violence and competition to unleash incredible prosperity such that we can be more empathetic and loving with our brothers and sisters across the nation. And it feels as if our collective efforts right now are to be more empathetic and loving with companies than with people. We've figured out a way to keep restaurants open. We've figured out a way to bail out small businesses and flatten the curve for rich people, but we haven't figured out a way to keep schools open. I mean, think about this. The two largest asset classes in America-- real estate and the stock market-- are at all-time highs. And by the way, 80% of those assets, by value, are owned by the top 10%. They're at all-time highs-- record prosperity, record savings rates. And at the same time, we have food insecurity. One in five households with kids have food insecurity. A third of Americans are worried they can't pay their rent. This is the best of times and the worst of times. We are barreling towards a nation with 3 million lords being served by 350 million serfs. We've decided to protect corporations, not people. Capitalism is literally collapsing on itself, unless it rebuilds that pillar of empathy supporting capitalism. JEN ROGERS: What responsibility do you think the four have-- Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google-- specifically as it goes to the issues you've been talking about and the inequality that we're seeing laid bare? Let's just take Amazon as an example. We just got through Black Friday. It's Cyber Monday. They are absolutely crushing it on sales. They've hired hundreds of thousands-- more than 400,000 people since the pandemic began. Most of those people though are warehouse workers making $15 an hour. What responsibility do those companies at the very top of the food chain you think have for not just where we've been, but really where we're going to affect change? SCOTT GALLOWAY: Yeah, so that's a meaningful question. So it struck me today-- and I don't think the two are correlated. I just meant to-- I want to use this to give your viewers and listeners a sense of proportion. In World War II, we were losing a third of the people that we are losing right now. And if you look at how many people Amazon is hiring every day, they're hiring about 1,400 people a day. That's about how many people each day are dying in America. And I just thought that was just sort of ironic when we talk about this K-shaped recovery. Now to your question on the responsibility these companies have, we'd like to think that these people have a code, and that they bring that code to work, and that they recognize the incredible blessings that America brings them, and that they want to prevent a tragedy of the commons. They want to pay their people well. I applaud Amazon for raising their minimum wage to $15 an hour. There's a lot to like about Amazon in my view in terms of what they've done with their employment base. They also have gamified municipalities such that we can transfer wealth from municipal fire, police, and school districts to the shareholders of Amazon through this ridiculous HQ2. They have also put small businesses out of business and prematurely euthanized big businesses by owning the rails, and anti-competitive behavior, and dumping products at prices through their access to cheap capital no other company can compete with. However-- however, I don't think it's smart-- I don't think it's a good strategy to wait on the better angels of billionaires. We can't wait on the generosity, and code, and personal conduct, and character of CEOs. To a certain extent, they're doing their job. It's we, as citizens, who are not doing ours. Specifically, we're not electing public officials that apply the same scrutiny around anti-trust, around anti-competitive behavior, around externalities when teens are getting depressed. We don't seem to want to hold these companies accountable or to the same standards we've held companies in the past. So if there's a culprit here, it's voters who aren't electing leaders that hold these companies to the same standards. If we're just going to wait for the better angels of Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg to show up, that is a bad strategy. ADAM SHAPIRO: Scott, I'm curious when you talk about capitalism on the way up, socialism on the way down, when you talk it's the voters who are bringing this upon ourselves. It doesn't sound like that's going to change, so where are we headed? It sounds like we're going to be headed to the 3 million you talk about-- bread and circuses like the old Roman Empire-- to keep the 330 million at bay. SCOTT GALLOWAY: Well, I'm actually-- I do think there's reasons for optimism. I think the Biden-Harris or the shadow of the Biden-Harris administration has fomented or catalyzed more positive change at Facebook and Twitter than in the last 10 years. I don't think it's an accident that all of a sudden Facebook and Twitter have found the technology and the will to start labeling misinformation around COVID-19 as misinformation. We've seen more of it in the last eight weeks than we've seen in the last eight years, and it's because the analogy I would use is you're seniors in high school and you've thrown the mother of all rager parties. And you get a text message on Sunday morning that your parents are coming home early and you're trying to clean up the house. There is the mother of all cleaning up their houses going on right now. Janet Yellen's appointment is very encouraging-- a more I don't want to call it activist, but more appointees that seem to believe in bilateral, multilateral cooperation, who seem to believe the regulation plays an important role, that will likely fund the CDC to the extent it warrants. $700 billion to the military, $7 billion to CDC. We're losing people at three times the velocity of World War II. It just seems like our priorities are a bit messed up here. And we have big tech, which has basically in my view, overrun Washington. So I am hopeful. There's some real silver linings here, but it's up to us to embrace those, and demand more of our leaders, and demand accountability, and realize that these companies are not people. We should not be protecting them. They're not concerned with the condition of our soul. They're not going to take care of us when we get older. Without structural change at a regulatory level, without a national complexion of sacrifice-- patriotism used to mean sacrifice. Now, it means stimulus. We planted victory gardens. We reached into our pockets. We didn't have our hand out. The notion that we would find wearing a mask to Walmart somehow tyrannical-- my mother in 1941 Britain slept in a makeshift bomb shelter and they passed out gas masks in the shape of Disney characters so the kids would put them on. And the idea that someone would say that this imposed on their individual freedom is just unthinkable. So we have a lot of soul searching to do here, but there's nothing wrong with America that can't be fixed with what's right with America. And I'm hopeful that a lot of those changes start in January. ADAM SHAPIRO: Scott, I've got to start wrapping up with you, but when you talk about your mother, I was thinking of my grandmother Hazel who drove a truck volunteer during World War II in Portland, Maine and the people of Portland are still terrified and stay off the roads. But I have to ask you, as I write up this discussion, we invite you into the program because you're someone people do listen to. What's the key message then because looking at the book, many of the things you say sound very pessimistic, and yet you say there's reason for hope. So that's my headline? What's the key message? SCOTT GALLOWAY: Capitalism fails unless it rests on a foundation of empathy and love. We have full-body contact violence at the corporate level. We let businesses go out of business. We let people get fired such that Apple can emerge and put Sun Microsystems out of business, and then we take that incredible prosperity and we're more empathetic with people. We fund social security so we can take 38% of seniors who are in poverty down to 11%. We fund Head Start. We have flipped the script and we've decided that capitalism means being loving and empathetic to corporations and Darwinistic and harsh towards individuals. Unless we flip it back and start deciding that capitalism is in the agency of others, and start letting corporations go out of business, and being harsh on corporations, and being more empathetic and generous with our citizens, capitalism-- the greatest system of its kind, the greatest upward lubricant of the middle class in history-- will collapse on itself. America isn't what it is. America is what we make of it. It is up to us, but it is time to go back to a system of America where capitalism rests on a pool of empathy. JEN ROGERS: Scott Galloway talking about industries may be going under. We didn't even get to talk about higher education, which you're in, so we'll have to dive into that another time. It's a great read. The book is \"Post Corona-- From Crisis to Opportunity.\" Scott Galloway, thanks so much for joining us. SCOTT GALLOWAY: Thank you."

    "headline":"Which BNPL Challenger Could Be the Next Fintech Unicorn?",
    "url":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/bnpl-challenger-could-next-fintech-202128686.html",
    "article_text":"COVID-19 has led to huge increases in the number of shoppers signing up for buy-now-pay-later accounts, fast-tracking the growth of many BNPL providers Many fintech firms have seen enormous growth in account sign-ups over recent months and this growth is hardly surprising \u2013 COVID-19 has affected many of us financially, and shoppers are turning to BNPL schemes to spread the cost of their shopping during this difficult time, especially in the run-up to holidays. Meanwhile, the pandemic has also led to a rise in online shopping thanks to lockdown store closures. As a result, BNPL providers around the world are accelerating towards unicorn rankings, and competition is high. Out of the hundreds of financial technologies on offer, here are seven BNPL providers that we think have what it takes to become the next fintech unicorn. Zilch (UK) Splitit (US, Australia, & UK) Splitit adopts a similar BNPL model to Zilch, only the system requires shoppers to use their existing credit cards to finance smaller payments over extended periods. While we doubt this approach suits customers who are looking for fee-free solutions or customers who aren\u2019t eligible for credit cards, Splitit does give customers more control over their purchases. The BNPL provider doesn\u2019t partner with as many high street stores as some of its competitors, but it does offer lots of choices when it comes to repayment schedules. The firm\u2019s payment installment options span all the way from three to 24 interest-free payment installations. Although the company doesn\u2019t charge interest fees or late fees, shoppers need to be aware that they are still subject to any fees associated with their linked credit card. Affirm (US) GoCardless (Europe) GoCardless adopts the BNPL model for small and large businesses instead of individual customers. While we find that its simple interface makes payment set-ups easy to schedule and manage, the system is particularly suited to companies that make many direct debit payments (rather than individual shoppers like me). GoCardless does support ad hoc and variable payments, but it\u2019s mainly geared towards subscription transactions. Firms can also integrate GoCardless with their invoicing system to take the friction out of payments and automate transactions. There are a couple of fees to be aware of: business payments made within the UK incur a 1% fee per transaction, and international payments incur a 2% fee per transaction. FuturePay (US) One of my favorite things about FuturePay is the MyTab feature, which allows shoppers to secure high-value items instantly and pay later. Perfect for quick-sell-out items such as concert tickets, sale products, and brand-new releases, customers can collate shopping lists throughout each month and pay on a set billing date. The only catch is that customers need to pay $5 for every $500 balance. QuadPay (US) QuadPay enables shoppers to split any payment into four installments, whether shopping in-store or online. With an instant approval system in place, customers can split the value of any item over six weeks, no matter the price. The consumer-centric platform makes transaction processes seamless and accepts all major cards. Meanwhile, the plug-and-play integration allows partner merchants to benefit from improved AOV and conversion rates, encouraging a higher level of repeat purchases from loyal customers. Zip Pay (Australia) Zip Pay is another BNPL provider that allows shoppers to spread the cost of their purchases both in-store and online. Customers use a six-digit code to secure a payment schedule upon checkout. The BNPL provider offers three credit limits, which different shoppers are eligible for depending on the information provided during the sign-up process. While we find that the system does provide an effective, interest-free line of credit, there is one small catch. You have to pay a small servicing fee if you have an outstanding balance at the beginning of the month. Customers must make a minimum monthly repayment on outstanding balances and pay a late fee if they do not pay the minimum repayment. Finding the Next Fintech Unicorn With so many BNPL providers rapidly expanding their reach during covid-19, there is a high level of competition. However, out of the countless options for BNPL products outside the US, we consider Zilch as a potential bet for unicorn status. Its partnership with Mastercard means that it\u2019s working in partnership with the big credit card incumbents rather than challenging them. And if Zilch scales its UK BNPL solution successfully, the firm is well-positioned for future markets. \u00a0"

Also, declining occupancy at the multifamily portfolio is worrisome. Lack of Collaboration Contracts Is a Woe for Novavax (NVAX) Per the Zacks analyst, Novavax's portfolio is devoid of collaboration contracts for product development, which is a concern. Stiff competition in the target market also remains a headwind. Weak Marketing Services & Rising Competition Ail eBay (EBAY) Per the Zacks analyst, eBay is hurt by sluggishness in its marketing services. Further, intensifying competition from Amazon, Alibaba and other players remains a risk."

    "article_text":"Black Friday, the day after Thanksgiving when retailers supposedly became profitable, is fading as the most important annual event for retailers. Cyber Monday, the online equivalent, seems poised this year to become the critical event. Roxanne Meyer, an MKM Partners analyst, advised clients in a research note that this year\u2019s Cyber Monday will set a new record if sales rise 15% to 35%, as expected by Adobe Analytics. Online Black Friday sales rose 22% to $9 billion, the second-highest online shopping day in history, behind last year\u2019s Cyber Monday.  Store visits\u2014clearly hurt by the Covid-19 pandemic which arguably accelerated the demise of Black Friday\u2014likely dropped by 52%, according to Sensormatic Solutions. \u201cOur traditional store checks over the holiday weekend were like none other we\u2019ve ever experienced in our lifetime\u2014not hustle and bustle, no lines at the register,\u201d Meyer wrote. Deborah Weinswig, who has long been one of the Street\u2019s top retail analysts, has told clients that Black Friday is no longer a bellwether. Instead of putting so much attention on one day of shopping, the final month or so of the year has been transformed into a month-long promotional event. \u201cEven if shoppers return to stores in greater numbers in future years, the direction of travel is away from a one-day, store-focused event, to a weeks\u2019 long, digital-heavy event,\u201d Weinswig, founder and chief executive officer of Coresight Research, wrote in a recent note to her clients.  For investors, all of this means it is time to evolve the traditional approach to event-driven holiday sales trading. It may no longer be enough to find the hottest items, or trends, and trade in anticipation of hot sales. With all big retailers seemingly selling everything, the winning retailer may be the one who best controls margins, which is tough for most investors to measure until after the fact.  Within this evolving situation, it is perhaps better to focus on points that link consumers and retailers: delivery services such as FedEx and UPS that ship goods from retailers to consumers. Everybody knows this\u2014which is as tough for stock pickers as it is potentially beneficial for options investors.  FedEx and UPS are the definition of momentum stocks, which are often easy for options investors to trade. The equities are in a sweet spot for options-centric investors as shares are trading strongly amid good fundamentals and with liquid options\u2014a combination that tends to create tradable moments. Aggressive investors can try to monetize the momentum of the stocks with an options strategy that benefits from the market mob\u2019s enthusiasm for FedEx and UPS, and the expectation that the delivery companies\u2019 drivers are unofficial members of Santa\u2019s army of elves.  To trade either name, focus on \u201ccall spreads\u201d which entail buying a call and selling another with a higher strike price but similar expiration. The strategy is used to profit from a stock\u2019s expected trading range.  Here\u2019s an example with FedEx: With the stock at $287, consider buying the January $290 call and selling the January $300 call for $4. If the stock is at $300 at expiration, investors will realize a maximum profit of $6 ($10 spread less the $4 cost of the position). If the stock declines, or rises less than the cost of the spread, the trade fails. During the past 52 weeks, FedEx has ranged from $88.69 to $296.08. The stock is up 80% over that span. "

    "headline":"Tony Hsieh Showed Promise and Perils\u00a0of Happiness",
    "url":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/tony-hsieh-showed-promise-perils-190022556.html",
    "article_text":"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Tony Hsieh, the former Zappos.com chief executive officer who died on Friday from injuries suffered in a house fire, was an unusual \u2014 and unusually humane \u2014 corporate executive. In 2009, after he grudgingly agreed to a buyout from Amazon.com Inc., Hsieh could have walked away from the online shoe seller an incredibly wealthy man \u2014 something many CEOs would have done. Instead, he negotiated a deal that gave Zappos a high degree of autonomy and stuck with the company for 11 more years, finally departing in August after leading the company for more than two decades. In 2013, after setting up a call center in Las Vegas, Hsieh decided to move the entire company there. He did so initially because he wanted people answering customer calls to feel fully a part of Zappos. But he also saw it as an opportunity to help revitalize a city down on its luck. By the time he died, he had spent $350 million of his own money on the effort. Hsieh instituted something called \u201cThe Offer\u201d \u2014 a means of compensating new employees who quickly concluded that Zappos was not the right place for them. After a week or so on the job, new employees were told that if they wanted to quit, they would be paid for the time they had put in, with an extra $1,000 thrown in for good measure. Thus, people who were unlikely to work out left with some money in their pocket and their heads held high. There are many other examples: Although Hsieh originally bought a luxury apartment in Las Vegas, he soon moved into a trailer park he helped establish, where he created a close-knit community. He encouraged people working in the call center to take as long as they needed to talk to customers \u2014 even when the discussion roamed far afield from shoes. He paid himself $36,000 a year and sat in a cubicle with the rest of the Zappos team. \u201cHis mission in life was to bring smiles and happiness to people everywhere he went,\u201d a former venture partner, Cyan Banister, told Forbes. She added, \u201cTony was like the leader of a parade. One big happy parade.\u201d Indeed, Hsieh considered happiness so important that he studied what it took to make people truly happy. He eventually wrote a book about it titled \u201cDelivering Happiness: A Path to Profits, Passion, and Purpose.\u201d The thesis of the book is that if you work hard at making sure both customers and employees are happy, your company will be successful. In the obituaries and appreciations of Hsieh that I read over the weekend, much was made of the extraordinary attention that Zappos paid to making customers happy. Great customer service was at the heart of the business model Hsieh imposed at the company. It was also a reason Amazon\u2019s CEO, Jeff Bezos, was so eager to buy Zappos: He saw in Hsieh a leader as devoted to pleasing customers as he was. (Another reason was that by 2009, Zappos had built a billion-dollar business selling shoes online while Amazon\u2019s efforts in the category had largely fallen flat.) \u201cI get all weak-kneed when I see a customer-obsessed company,\u201d Bezos said at the time of the merger. It is also why Bezos decided to give Hsieh and Zappos such an unusual degree of autonomy. What were largely brushed over in those obituaries were Hsieh\u2019s efforts to create an employee culture of happiness; here, I think, things get a little more problematic. Hsieh\u2019s first company was an internet ad service called LinkExchange, which he eventually sold to Microsoft. As he would explain later, one of the things that bothered him was that as LinkExchange grew and needed to hire people who were not friends of the original team, its early culture was lost. It got to the point where he hated going to work at his own company. After the sale to Microsoft, he walked away as quickly as he could. At Zappos, Hsieh wanted everyone to be themselves, to enjoy one another and to have fun. Jennifer Reingold, writing in Fortune magazine, visited Zappos\u2019s Las Vegas headquarters in 2016 and described the scene like this: The company\u2019s \u201cresident artist,\u201d who started as a Zappos call-center worker, is painting an enormous chrysanthemum on a canvas near the entrance. Red lanterns festoon the lobby of the semicircular 1970s edifice, which once housed the Las Vegas city government, in honor of Chinese New Year. A few hours later, all 1,500 employees of the online shoe and clothing retailer gather in the nearby MGM Grand theater, home to the Cirque du Soleil show K\u00e0, for Zappos\u2019s quarterly All-Hands Meeting, an afternoon of progress reports, music, and fun. The Zappos culture, Reingold wrote, \u201cembraces the idiosyncrasies of each individual.\u201d Except for one small problem: The culture wasn\u2019t really working for a lot of the people who had long worked at Zappos. In 2013, Hsieh decided to eliminate the traditional corporate structure of an employee hierarchy \u2014 workers reporting to managers, who reported to executives, who reported to the CEO \u2014 and replaced it with something he called \u201cholacracy.\u201d This was a radically new system in which there were no managers and no titles, and everyone was deemed to be equal. What could possibly make people happier than having no bosses? And how better to retain a company\u2019s startup vibe than eliminating hierarchy? Instead, it caused chaos and discontent. Rather than eliminating internal politics, holacracy exacerbated it. While some employees felt empowered, others felt hamstrung, even paralyzed. There were lots of meetings, but if the group couldn\u2019t come to a conclusion, there was no one to make a final decision. Someone who was once your manager could ask you to do something, but you didn\u2019t have to. In the first year that Zappos became a holacracy, 18% of the staff took buyouts. (In classic Hsieh fashion, the CEO announced before installing the new system that anyone who didn\u2019t like it would receive at least three months\u2019 severance.) Three years later, according to Reingold, the departures had actually accelerated: 29% had taken buyouts in the previous 12 months. Eventually, Zappos realized that its employees were spending so much time focused on their internal culture they were losing focus on the customers. So over time, old-style management crept back into the company, though with new-age sounding titles. Today, Zappos has turned to a more traditional way of keeping the company nimble and unbureaucratic: It has broken the company up into smaller units that are each responsible for their own bottom line. There is still a lot of communal decision-making but there is also a designated boss. Does Hsieh deserve credit for trying to find a better way to manage a company \u2014 a way that might make employees even happier than they\u2019d been before? Sure he does. But in the end, holacracy didn\u2019t make them more productive \u2014 quite the opposite \u2014 and companies with unproductive employees don\u2019t succeed, no matter how happy those employees are. In an article he co-wrote in 2015, Hsieh listed his four principles that drive happiness: A sense of control over your own destiny; the perception that you\u2019re making progress in your life; connectedness with others; and being part of something bigger than yourself. Virtually from the day he became CEO, Hsieh ensured that all four of those principles were at the heart of the Zappos culture. Every CEO can learn something from that example. What he didn\u2019t understand was that holacracy diminished those principles instead of heightening them. Other CEOs can learn from that example as well.

    "url":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/amazon-option-trader-makes-4-185505036.html",
    "article_text":"At 10:31 a.m., a trader bought 554 Amazon call options with a $4,400 strike price expiring on Sept. 17 at the ask price of $85. The trade represented a roughly $4.71-million bullish bet. Why It\u2019s Important: Even traders who stick exclusively to stocks often monitor option market activity closely for unusually large trades. Given the relative complexity of the options market, large options traders are typically considered to be more sophisticated than the average stock trader. Many of these large options traders are wealthy individuals or institutions who may have unique information or theses related to the underlying stock. Unfortunately, stock traders often use the options market to hedge against their larger stock positions, and there\u2019s no surefire way to determine if an options trade is a standalone position or a hedge. In this case, given the relatively large size of Monday\u2019s Amazon option trade, it could certainly be institutional hedging. Rotation From Growth To Value: The huge put option purchase comes after Amazon and other large-cap tech stocks have stalled in the month of November. In fact, growth stocks like Amazon have underperformed value stocks since Election Day, a sharp reversal of the longer-term trend of growth stocks outperforming value stocks by a wide margin since the 2008 financial crisis. The million-dollar question for traders of Amazon and other growth stock leaders is just how long this rotation will last and has the era of growth stock outperformance finally ended after more than a decade. Benzinga\u2019s Take: Monday\u2019s big put buyer seems to be betting that the rotation out of big tech stocks will be long forgotten this time next year. Value stocks have outperformed tech stock for several brief periods of time over the past decade, but the rotation never lasted for longer than a couple of months at a time. The $4.7-million call purchase has a break-even price of $4,485, suggesting 42.6% upside for the stock over the next 10 months. See more from Benzinga \u00a9 2020 Benzinga.com.

At the stock's current price, around $33, that would raise about $260 million and dilute existing shareholders by approximately 10%. The company said the proceeds would be used for general corporate purposes.  Unlike most e-commerce companies, which have derived significant tailwinds from the coronavirus pandemic, Jumia has seen revenue actually decline during the crisis. That is due in part to the company's decision to shift its business model from a first-party seller to primarily a third-party marketplace.

    "article_text":"Edward Kelly at Wells Fargo has boosted his price target on Five Below from $155 to what is now a Street-high $182. He was the third analyst to raise his price goal this month, but the timing here matters. Five Below reports its fiscal third-quarter results after Wednesday's market close, so Kelly wouldn't have made the move he did early Monday morning unless he felt the retailer was about to impress the market again.\u00a0 Image source: Five Below. The chain may be cheap for shoppers, but its stock may not initially seem that way for investors. Five Below trades at nearly 90 times trailing reported earnings, and its enterprise value clocks in at 5.7 times trailing net sales. Those valuations are not for the faint of heart when it comes to brick-and-mortar retailers. Even Amazon.com fetches a lower top-line multiple and its trailing bottom-line valuation is comparable.\u00a0 \u00a0 Five Below also admittedly has a weak e-commerce game -- last quarter, it delivered hardly any sales growth. The red flags are everywhere, and even Wells Fargo's Kelly was a bit hesitant in his bullish update. He stuck to his overweight rating on the shares -- naturally -- but he did point out that the stock has run up quite a bit already in recent months. He also feels that questions remain as to how Five Below will fare over the holidays, but he still tapped it as one of the best growth stories among consumer stocks, and credits it with having the potential to surprise analysts on the upside in 2021.\u00a0 Store closures will be less of a factor in Wednesday's report. Wall Street expects net sales to climb 18% for the quarter, and anticipates the chain will deliver its strongest earnings growth of the fiscal year. Five Below's concept is working. Stocking items priced at $5 or less -- hence the name -- has made it magnetic to brick-and-mortar shoppers at a time when many other physical chains' business models are buckling. It makes the most of its retail space, and landlords are hungry for tenants that can draw and pay.\u00a0 E-commerce is still not a major part of the story, but that's fine for now. Five Below continues to find new ways to drum up interest in its format. It recently launched a store section that features items costing up to $10, which considerably broadens the possibilities for what it can stock. It has been stepping up its dot-com game recently as well. It will be worth watching to see whether it can develop its e-commerce channel into something that can move the needle for it in the near future.\u00a0"

    "article_text":"Jan Rogers Kniffen, J Rogers Kniffen Worldwide CEO, joins Yahoo Finance\u2019s Julie Hyman, Myles Udland, and Brian Sozzi to discuss retail outlook as COVID-19 cases continue to surge. JULIE HYMAN: We're talking holiday shopping season on \"Yahoo Finance Live\" today and on this Cyber Monday as we sift through some of the numbers that are coming in from the holiday weekend. We are looking at projections for how Cyber Monday is going to be, how the holiday season is going to be overall. Jan Rogers Kniffen is joining us now. He's the CEO of J Rogers Kniffen Worldwide, longtime retail consultant. And Jan, I know that you look a lot at department stores specifically-- which, as we know, some of them at least have been having sort of a long, slow decline. Is this the year that finally pushes them over the edge or is this year that really sifts out who is doing it right from those who are not? JAN ROGERS KNIFFEN: Oh gosh, you know, that long, slow decline started way back 50 years ago when I got in the business. We had 200 department store names in the country. Now, what have we got? If you count it broadly, we've basically got Macy's and Dillard's. So is this when it pushes over the edge? It was pushed over the edge a long time ago. Macy's is still going to be with us. Nordstrom's is still going to be with us. Kohl's is still going to be with us for the long-term. The rest of them we have questions about, I admit. So yes, we're seeing them push really hard, because traffic's down a lot. And even though it was a slow decline for many years, it's been a fast decline since March 12 of this year. And I do think that we'll see-- you know, Penney's already went, right? And they're being reconstituted. But they went. Neiman's already filed as well. So yeah, we're seeing the transition completed now. But digital is where the world is. And the stores have to be both digital and physical. But the growth component is no longer whether it's going to be online or in-store or omnichannel or something like that. It's digital and physical. And it's just retail. And so we're going to see fewer stores, and we're going to see more competitive structure. And yes, we need fewer department stores even than we have today. BRIAN SOZZI: Jan, I exchanged an email with you on Black Friday. And I asked you, where are all the traffic in New York City? I went into the Macy's Herald Square store. It's 11 floors, 1.1 million square feet of retail space. It was really virtually tumbleweeds. I could have brought my football there and had a tag football game or a flag football game. Once we leave the holiday season, if we continue to see these double-digit declines in traffic from malls and the department stores, how many stores, mall stores do you think could close in the first half of next year? JAN ROGERS KNIFFEN: Oh my gosh, I mean, there's 110,000 stores in America in total. And we think there's going to be at least 25,000 of those 110,000 stores closed over the-- from now through the time that COVID ends and we get to the other side of it. So in the malls, of the 1,100 closed malls in America, we could see half of those go dark or be changed dramatically in nature. And we could see a whole lot of stores close. But yeah, sure, we could see 15,000 stores closed that come out of the malls, 10,000, some number like that. So that's not going to be surprising, because it's been going on before COVID. We were seeing 10,000 stores a year close pre-COVID. There's only been about 8,500 so far this year of officially announced closures. But that'll just be a tail, right? We'll see that continue. And the reason you haven't seen the announcements yet is because some of those dark stores may reopen, may not. They haven't been announced. So we'll see a lot better number than the 8,300 or so that we believe has already happened this year. And I believe-- haven't we all believed all along? I think I wrote in 2014 that by 2030, we'd see 50% of all non-bar, non-restaurant sales online. That's back when only about 3% was actually online. So yeah, sure, that's coming. But it was coming anyway. It's just been accelerated by COVID. MYLES UDLAND: You know, Jan, we're talking about the few retailers that might make it through. You mentioned Macy's and Kohl's among them. But a lot of these gains are accruing to Targets, Walmarts, Amazons. They're the monoliths now. Is it time to start thinking about the next leg of retail? What could challenge those business models at some future point when there is 50% online penetration? Because the decline of the mall-- I mean, we can look back and talk about it. But it sounds almost like that story is over, and it's time to think about what's next maybe. JAN ROGERS KNIFFEN: Hey, man, I've been doing this a long time. I lived through the rise of the mall and the destruction of the downtown, and all the things that we saw happen in the creative destruction of retail. This is not new. Once upon a time, when Walmart was 20 years old, it was 3% of national sales and it was getting $0.50 out of every new dollar of sales. Amazon's a little over 20 years old. It's 4% of national sales. It's getting $0.35 out of every new dollar of retail sales. That's already happening. So going forward, do I think that Walmart, Target are big winners? Yeah. Home Depot, probably Lowe's. Costco for sure, best retailer in the world. Yeah, I think those guys are going to continue to gain market share in this current environment, because they're healthy. They can invest all they want. They were deemed essential. They got to stay open. All the good things happened with them. And they're all really great retailers. They were winning before COVID, and now they're just winning more during COVID. But do I think there'll be new rising things to fight the battle with Amazon and Target and Walmart? Yeah, sure, I absolutely do. I don't know what they are yet. I have three or four, actually six now little retail tech startups that I stood on the advisory board of. Will one of those be the next Starbucks or the next Walmart? God, I hope so. But something will be. This is not going to go away. So yeah, we're going to see that change continue. And we're going to see the decline of the mall. That was already started. We're going to see the rise of the surviving big box. But we saw the destruction of the big box. How many of those are already gone? And think about it. Walmart and Target are the only discounters really left. All those guys like Gold Circle Land, Zayre, and Kmart, and all those-- they all got taken out by their own kind. So this is not-- there's nothing surprising going on here. And we've all known it was going to happen since 1999 when I walked in a distribution center with Jeff Bezos. It wasn't hard to figure out that the world was going to change. You know, I also [? stocked ?] 26th Walmart ever built. Think about it. There's 4,500 just in America now. JULIE HYMAN: Wow. So Jan, let's talk about the changes that might be coming that we might not expect, or at least there's some debate about. We've all been talking about what changes that are happening right now are going to remain permanent. Are we all going to be sweatpants clad for the rest of our lives? And I think-- JAN ROGERS KNIFFEN: Lord, no. JULIE HYMAN: --you were in the camp who says no. JAN ROGERS KNIFFEN: No way. JULIE HYMAN: So talk to me about pent-up demand for looking better. JAN ROGERS KNIFFEN: Fashion is not dead. Consumers wanting to look good is not dead. You will see the Roaring '20s start in about April of this year when we've got wide distribution of a vaccine. We've also got a Tamiflu-like cure for the vaccine. People are less afraid of it. And on the first pretty day in April, every woman in America is going to look in her closet and go, I hate all this stuff. I need new clothes. And it's not just going to be some crummy sweat outfit that they can sit in front of their computer in all day. They're going to go, I don't know. I could be back in the office a couple of days a week. Is this what I want to wear? And you're going to see an explosion of consumer spending on fun fashion stuff like you haven't seen in years. The Roaring '20s will be on us by midsummer, at the latest, of 2021. JULIE HYMAN: Break out the miniskirts, fringe, and champagne. Jan Rogers Kniffen, great to see you. Thanks so much for being with us, CEO of J Rogers Kniffen Worldwide. Really appreciate your time today."

    "article_text":"Yahoo Finance\u2019s Julie Hyman, Myles Udland, and Brian Sozzi speak with Shipt CEO Kelly Caruso as online shopping booms amid COVID-19 and ahead of the holidays. BRIAN SOZZI: Same day delivery services are having a big moment this holiday season, as people avoid stores during the pandemic and Target Shipt services right in the middle of the same day delivery action. Kelly Caruso is the CEO of Shipt, and she joins us now. Kelly, good to speak with you here. I've been using Shipt for quite some time. I get it, it has proven very helpful to me. But I was in the Target stores this weekend, and I've seen a lot of the Shipt personal shoppers really pack stores. What have you seen at the start of the holiday season? There has been concern about how it has started, but I've seen a lot of those shoppers in Target stores. How would you grade the start? KELLY CARUSO: Yeah. Hey Brian, good morning. It's great to be here. Undeniably, we're off to a very strong start. We have set records in the weeks and days leading up to the holiday start. In fact, on Thanksgiving Day alone, with so many retailers that were closed for that day, we saw a 65% increase, year over year. And that momentum continued, not only through Black Friday, but well into the weekend as consumers continued to place orders around both groceries and giftable items. And so as we head into Cyber Monday today, we feel well-poised and positioned with our shopper community of almost 300,000 strong to really partner with our customers and our retail partners in delivering Cyber Monday orders today for same day delivery. BRIAN SOZZI: Kelly, it sounds as if you're ready to blow past your, I believe what, the fourth quarter goal, double the amount of new shoppers you might add to the platform? KELLY CARUSO: Yeah. When we came into the year, we started with 100,000 shoppers. We quickly scaled to 200,000 when we saw the initial demand from the pandemic. And for the holiday season, we'd like to grow from 200,000 to 350,000 shoppers, and we're well on our way to that. JULIE HYMAN: Kelly, it's Julie here. Thanks for joining us. Talk to me how this works, sort of logistically. In other words, if you have all those new people you're hiring, who are, in many cases shopping in the store, how do you work in terms of workflow because of pandemic capacity restrictions? And also, I have to admit from a shopping experience, I have been in stores when there are people from your competitors, for example, who are doing shopping for delivery. And at times it can be off-putting when, as a regular shopper, you're sort of competing for space with people who are in the store shopping for delivery. KELLY CARUSO: Yeah, yeah. So I would say a couple of things, Julie. Number one, we have bet on the power of the personal shopper since day one. We believe at Shipt that technology without that human element is not relevant for the future. And so our shoppers do a couple of things really well. They know how to pick a product and get the order exactly right, whether that is groceries to giftable items like toys and electronics. They are great communicators. And that applies to not only the customer, but to the retail employees and the stores that they are shopping. They develop amazing relationships with their counterparts in retail stores. And lastly, their attention to detail and their ability to go above and beyond creates a great experience, not only for our Shipt customers, but for our retail partners. And Shipt is truly seen as a brand extension or a brand ambassador, if you will. We absolutely want to be a retail partner. We do not want to be a retailer. And so by working closely with our retailers, we're able to understand what protocols they have into place on a location by location basis, to make sure that we are enhancing that shopping experience, not detracting from it. And the last thing I would say is early on in the pandemic, it was really important that we create this safe shopping environment for both our shoppers, and our customers. And to do that, not only did we scale up our shoppers, but we also offered them and continue to, protective equipment on a daily basis. We offer financial assistance if they are diagnosed with COVID. And we created more product features such as contactless delivery, to really have the highest level of safety possible. And what we've seen is our consumers and our customers, they feel like they've got a partner as they head into the holidays. Celebrating the holidays are important. Doing it safely is equally important, and Shipt is a great holiday helper for them. MYLES UDLAND: Hey Kelly, it's Myles here. You were talking a little bit earlier with Brian about some of the membership trends that you've seen. And I'd be curious if what we've seen during the pandemic has had you guys rethinking your TAM here, if it's actually a bigger market available to a company like a Shipt, because there's forced behaviors have happened and people realize they've actually liked this. Is that something that you have thought about at all? KELLY CARUSO: Absolutely, Myles. We believe that online shopping and the subsequent fulfillment systems that go along with that, they're here to stay. And so as I look forward to 2021, myself and the entire Shipt team, we are really focused on four key areas. Number one, we'll continue to grow our footprint and coverage area in the US. Secondly, we want to continue to expand the retail offering that we've got on our marketplace to ensure that there is absolutely the right mix of grocery, household essentials, general merchandiser, and retail verticals. Next, we're going to focus on our product offerings, whether that is growing our marketplace, continuing to grow our delivery only services, expanding our platform product offering, and continuing to offer white label options. We want to partner with our retail partners to create the fulfillment service that is right for their business. And lastly, but probably most importantly, as we'll continue to create inclusive environments, both for our team, our shopper community, and our retailers at large. Our purpose is to spark the connections that show how every person counts, and we'll continue to do that in 2021. BRIAN SOZZI: Kelly, and that's a key point to it. Shipt is not just a Target thing. You still work with many other big name retailers. And to that end, really, same day delivery is only going to get faster. And it's going to be a real critical component to brick and mortar retail. As you look to next year, how are you going to get more humans to come and work for Shipt, and how many people do you think you're going to have to hire just to meet the new normal demand we're seeing out of retail? KELLY CARUSO: Yeah, yeah. So Brian, I would say a couple of things. Number one, as you know, it is expensive to build out e-commerce and fulfillment capabilities. And Shipt is a great partner for retailers to partner with, instead of building on their own. We want to enhance their in-store experience, not replace that. So we are a great, trusted partner to that end. As we think about scaling our business to meet demand in 2021, we will continue to place bets on the personal shopper. And we believe that Shipt is a great opportunity for our shoppers to have an opportunity to work flexible hours and earn great income. And we know that today, we pay about $22 per shop, including tip. And so listening to our shoppers, continuing to create these flexible income opportunities, creating product enhancements, really making Shipt the premier platform for all of our shoppers' needs is what we will focus on to ensure that we're able to not only recruit, but retain the shoppers on our platform. BRIAN SOZZI: All right, we'll leave it there. Kelly Caruso, the CEO of Shipt, good to see you. And good luck this holiday season. KELLY CARUSO: Thank you, Brian."

    "article_text":"Black Friday is the official unofficial kickoff to the holiday shopping season and is supposed to help catapult retailers to profitability. This year, though, one analyst says customer traffic in physical stores is the weakest he's seen in 15 years of tracking guest counts. While Wall Street was expecting to see depressed numbers this year, the actual decline may indicate the fourth quarter will be worse than many retailers and analysts were anticipating.\u00a0 Image source: Getty Images. KeyBanc analyst Edward Yruma said the firm's e-commerce team conducted its annual channel checks for in-store and online traffic over the weekend and found it was \"the weakest that we have observed in 15+ years of store checks.\" To an extent that's not wholly surprising. Rising cases of COVID-19 have caused a number of cities and states to begin locking down again while out of an abundance of caution consumers themselves are avoiding malls and stores because of the coronavirus pandemic. Moreover, Black Friday lost its importance this year because retailers made it Black November and have been running sales for weeks to make up for lost time. The need to go out to stores on the day after Thanksgiving has diminished dramatically.\u00a0 Adobe, which also monitors online shopping traffic, saw e-commerce Black Friday sales spike 20% to 29% this year.\u00a0 Even so, the National Retail Federation's estimate of a 3.6% to 5.2% rise in Christmas sales this year may be too rosy of a projection."

    "article_text":"However, with questions beginning to emerge about where the stock can go next, the price seems to be chasing its tail of late and going nowhere. Investors are beginning to reassess and need to decide whether Datadog can find more room to run or has this dog had its day and is ready for the doghouse. Putting the puns aside for the moment, Datadog offers operational analysis of a company through what it calls \"monitoring as a service.\" It compiles data from all aspects of cloud applications to make the entire stack of a tech company's operations observable from one point. Moreover, with a forward P\/E ratio that has risen above 430, Datadog stock sells for a considerable premium. The fact that the stock has risen by more than 140% this year partially explains the multiple.\u00a0 Much of this growth came as the pandemic led to a switch in work from the office to the home. Such a need accelerated the demand for cloud products, and by extension, the need to monitor such activity. Despite the investor reaction, Datadog still delivered a stellar third-quarter earnings report in early November. In this most recent quarter (which ended Sept. 30), revenue surged by 61% from the same quarter last year. Additionally, the company experienced a considerable increase in customers spending at least $100,000. This number rose to 1,107, up from 727 in the year-ago quarter. Image source: Getty Images. Analysts also expect the growth party to continue. For now, they forecast 63% revenue growth this year and 36% in 2021. Currently, Datadog supports a market cap of around $28 billion. Still, despite its relatively small size, it has built a discernable competitive advantage. The company has partnered with Amazon to help its Amazon Web Services and Alphabet's Google Cloud Services to offer added data services to the companies' cloud customers. Datadog looks poised to succeed. Not only does revenue growth remain massive, but it has managed to placate mega-cap competitors by building partnerships and avoiding those companies creating competing services. Nonetheless, at some point, valuation matters. While Datadog continues to log impressive growth numbers, it does not appear to generate enough growth to justify a forward P\/E ratio that has reached the current lofty levels. Investors seem to sense this, as they sold off the stock amid Datadog's stellar earnings report. Datadog may well be a lead dog in the future of cloud monitoring. It also appears likely to trade at higher levels five years from now. However, at this stage, Datadog stock has probably gotten a bit ahead of it tail. Hence, potential investors might serve themselves better by offering their treats to other investments for the moment."

In addition to this, the $150 bonus will be provided to eligible hourly team employees.The news comes on the heels of the strike announcement by German employees in seven of its warehouses. The workers alleged that poor pay and unfair working conditions are the primary reasons behind the strike.The recent announcement could have been a reassurance to workers who have been protesting regarding better pay and hygiene amid this pandemic. \u00a0 Amazon.com, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Amazon.com, Inc. Quote The recent bonus underscores Amazon\u2019s efforts to offer financial support to frontline employees amid the pandemic. Apart from this, the company has been providing recognition and support to its employees by offering virtual facilities.However, earlier, the company faced several lawsuits in both Europe and the United States, claiming that it is not doing enough to prevent the spread of Covid-19 in its warehouses. Also, in October, Amazon said that nearly 20,000 of its employees in the United States tested positive for COVID-19.Moreover, the company has been facing continuous strikes in many countries namely the U.K., Italy, Germany and Spain, demanding the right for collective bargaining, proper working conditions and regard for their efforts. These strikes during the peak shopping period do not bode well for an online retailer like Amazon, which gives the assurance of fast delivery.Nevertheless, the company has been denying the allegations by claiming that workers are working at better pay and good conditions.Also, it has been making continuous efforts to ensure the welfare of its workers amid the coronavirus-induced crisis. The company has tried to put in better testing techniques all over its facilities. Furthermore, it has disinfectant fogging at its fulfillment centers, sortation centers and delivery stations. In regard to workers\u2019 safety, to date, the company has implemented more than 150 significant process changes across its sites worldwide.Despite these efforts, we need to wait and see whether such incentives can placate the company\u2019s U.S. workers and win their confidence or not. Clearly, Amazon\u2019s efforts exemplify that it is committed and sensitive toward employees as much as it is toward customers during this pandemic.In addition to Amazon, a few other companies have also provided financial support to frontline associates in recognition of their esteemed contribution during the pandemic. For instance, Walmart Inc. WMT distributed special cash bonuses to frontline associates working across Walmart stores, Sam\u2019s Clubs and supply chain facilities. Also, Lowe\u2019s Companies Inc. LOW committed to pay an additional $100 million of discretionary bonuses to its frontline hourly workers across U.S. stores, distribution centers and store support centers. Also, The Kroger Co.

It is coming down hard on counterfeits in a bid to clean up its marketplace.The recent launch of Intellectual Property Accelerator (IP Accelerator) in Europe is a testament to the aforesaid fact.Notably, the program connects entrepreneurs directly with recommended legal firms, which enables them to seek general IP advice as their brands and businesses grow. The service is aimed to help small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) obtain trademarks, protect their brands, and tackle counterfeit goods.With the latest move, the company strives to deliver an enhanced shopping experience to customers in Europe by delivering authentic products.Thus, Amazon will now be able to offer protection against product counterfeits, which will serve the interests of buyers and sellers in Europe. \u00a0 Amazon.com, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Amazon.com, Inc. Quote The latest move is in sync with Amazon\u2019s strong efforts to expand the global footprint of its IP Accelerator program.Launched in the United States in 2019, the company connected thousands of SMBs with participating IP law firms. This resulted in the submission of 6,000 trademark applications to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.The latest move makes IP Accelerator currently available in 10 more countries, namely, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Netherlands and the U.K.We note that the global expansion of the program will help solid traction among sellers and buyers as product counterfeiting is an industry-wide concern due to which many people still hesitate from doing online shopping, especially in developing countries.Notably, there are more than 100 trademarks that have enrolled in the Amazon program across Europe. Even stronger growth of the e-commerce industry due to COVID-19, with consumers increasingly buying things online, is a dynamic going in favor of Amazon. While the big brands may build their online stores over time, a platform like Amazon allows the discovery of new buyers.Smaller players are far more dependent on Amazon as they don\u2019t have the resources to invest in technology and fulfillment to generate the kind of reach that Amazon can deliver. Amazon\u2019s platform is currently being used by millions of independent sellers.Therefore the company is making all efforts to protect and support small businesses.Apart from Amazon IP Accelerator, the company\u2019s Amazon Counterfeit Crime Unit, Amazon Transparency, Amazon Brand Registry, and Project Zero are some more developments in an effort to deliver authentic products to customers and protect sellers\u2019 intellectual properties.The launch of IP Accelerator in Europe is the latest effort taken by the online retail giant to battle the situation.This remains noteworthy and is expected to continue driving Amazon\u2019s customer and seller momentum in the near term. Currently, Amazon carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

    "article_text":"Kohl's Corporation KSS is in solid shape, courtesy of strong e-commerce business. Also, the company\u2019sstrategic efforts to drive growth and lucrative partnerships are worth mentioning.Let\u2019s dive deeper. Kohl\u2019s is benefiting from its growing digital business for a while now. Notably, digital revenues contributed 32% to total sales, while increasing 25% year over year during third-quarter fiscal 2020. The upside can be attributed to customers\u2019 increased shift to online shopping amid the coronavirus outbreak. Given the need of the hour, management is speeding up its digital marketing and enhancing website to cater to customers\u2019 needs. Certainly, the company\u2019s investments toward boosting online capabilities and improving consumer engagement are yielding. Management expects to keep leveraging its strong online presence.We note that the company\u2019s solid endeavors to boost mobile traffic have augmented the adoption of the Kohl app, making it a vital constituent of online sales. To improve online offerings, Kohl\u2019s is expanding its e-commerce fulfillment centers along with strengthening in-store pickups. In October, Kohl\u2019s introduced a new strategic framework that focuses on four key areas \u2014 driving top-line growth, expanding operating margin, implementing disciplined capital management and undertaking an agile accountable and inclusive culture. Under its driving top-line growth initiative, the company intends to become the most trusted retailer of choice for active and casual lifestyle. Also, Kohl\u2019s is undertaking strategic efforts to create loyalty and value along with providing a differentiated omni-channel experience for customers.Notably, Kohl\u2019s intends to reach its operating margin goal of 7-8% with the help of modest level of growth, its ongoing transformational margin initiatives and focus on operational excellence. Further, management is committed to disciplined capital management. Also, the company\u2019s innovative and adaptive learning approach and focus on diversity and inclusion bodes well.Kohl\u2019s is strengthening its ties with retail giant Amazon AMZN to drive traffic. Incidentally, the company has been benefiting from the rollout of its Amazon returns program nationwide. In the long run, the company is expected to receive significant boost to its business through this partnership. Further Kohl\u2019s partnership with Fanatics, Property Brothers and Home Decor bodes well. Kohl\u2019s has been seeing rising selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of total revenues, for a while now. In the third quarter of fiscal 2020, the metric increased to 32.7% from 30.7% reported in the prior-year quarter. Moreover, the company\u2019s gross margin contracted 48 basis points in the fiscal third quarter thanks to escalated shipping costs, owing to higher digital sales penetration. Going into the fiscal fourth quarter, management expects gross margin to stay under pressure owing to increased shipping costs, as it anticipates digital penetration to remain high along with incremental Sprite surcharges.Nevertheless, we believe that the aforementioned upsides are likely to keep driving this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company\u2019s performance. Notably, shares of Kohl\u2019s have surged 56.8% in the past three months compared with the industry\u2019s growth of 57.3%.

    "article_text":"Image source: eBay. eBay created the world's first online auction platform for person-to-person transactions 25 years ago. It subsequently expanded across dozens of\u00a0countries and added new features -- including \"Buy It Now\" shopping, universal product code searches, and other services -- to broaden its ecosystem. Between 2002 and 2015, eBay owned\u00a0PayPal and processed payments through its platform. It spun off PayPal in an IPO in 2015 and started transitioning merchants to its new partner, the European payments processor Adyen, earlier this year. eBay is currently the\u00a0third largest e-commerce platform in the U.S. after Amazon and Shopify in terms of gross merchandise volume (GMV), but the three companies operate different business models. Last quarter, eBay's active buyers rose 5% year-over-year to 183 million. GMV grew 22% to $25.0 billion, and revenue increased 25% to $2.6 billion. All three figures exclude its StubHub online tickets business, which it sold in February, and the classifieds business, which it plans to sell by the first quarter of 2021. Like many other e-commerce companies, eBay generated significantly higher growth over the past two quarters as online purchases accelerated throughout the pandemic. Growth (YOY) Q3 2019 Q4 2019 Q1 2020 Q2 2020 Q3 2020 Annual Active Buyers 4% 2% 2% 5% 5% GMV (4%) (5%) (1%) 26% 22% Revenue 0% (2%) (2%) 18% 25% YOY = year over year. Data source: eBay. Table by author.  But unlike Amazon, Shopify, and Etsy -- which generated robust growth prior to the pandemic -- eBay's growth had previously been decelerating. It blamed that slowdown on new internet sales taxes in several U.S. states and a reduction in its marketing expenses, which stabilized its take rate (the percentage of each sale it retains as revenue) and profits but throttled its GMV growth.

Its cost-cutting measures and divestments indicate it's playing defense in a market that favors aggressive expansion, and indirect competition from Amazon, Etsy, and social-shopping platforms could throttle its long-term growth."

    "url":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/crowdstrike-vrwd-report-q3-earnings-134201756.html",
    "article_text":"CrowdStrike Holdings CRWD is slated to release third-quarter fiscal 2021 results on Dec 2. For the fiscal third quarter, the company estimates revenues in the $210.6-$215 million band. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly revenues is pegged at $213.7 million, indicating a 70.8% year-over-year surge. For the bottom line, management expects to report between loss per share of a penny and a break-even. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same stands at break-even compared with the loss of 7 cents per share posted in the year-ago period. CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. price-consensus-chart | CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. Quote In the last reported quarter, the company had recorded adjusted earnings of 3 cents per share as against the loss of 18 cents per share posted in the year-ago quarter. Further, revenues soared 89% year on year to $184.3 million. Notably, the company\u2019s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 162.5%. Let\u2019s see how things have shaped up for this announcement. CrowdStrike\u2019s quarterly results are anticipated to reflect benefits from continued solid demand for its products, given the healthy environment of the global security market. Also, a huge global workforce is working remotely, in an effort to contain the spread of coronavirus. However, an increasing number of people logging into employers' networks is triggering a greater need for security. This trend might have had spurred demand for CrowdStrike\u2019s products during the fiscal third quarter. Furthermore, CrowdStrike\u2019s quarterly results are likely to reflect stellar growth in subscription revenues. Increasing number of net new subscription customers might have been a key tailwind as well. The company is anticipated to have gained from the growing strength in subscription customers, who are frequently adopting four or more cloud modules. CrowdStrike\u2019s cloud-native Falcon platform is a major driver. In addition, investment in the collaboration with Amazon's AMZN AWS is an upside. The company is benefiting from its product availability on the AWS platform. Expansion in volume of transactions through the AWS Marketplace, growth in the co-selling opportunities with AWS salesforce, and the uptake of AWS service integrations are likely to have boosted the company\u2019s earnings performance during the period in discussion. Our proven model does not predict an earnings beat for CrowdStrike this season. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP, and Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold), increases the chances of an earnings beat. But that\u2019s not the case here. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell, before they\u2019re reported, with our Earnings ESP Filter. CrowdStrike currently carries a Zacks Rank of 3 and has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. Here are some companies, which, per our model, have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter: Toronto Dominion Bank TD has an Earnings ESP of +3.63% and carries a Zacks Rank of 2, at present. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. The Kroger Co. KR has an Earnings ESP of +0.38% and carries a Zacks Rank of 2, currently. Last year, it generated $24 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $77.6 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce \"\"the world's first trillionaires,\"\" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.

    "article_text":"To the victors go the spoils, the saying goes. That certainly holds true with internet companies, where several definite winners have emerged, namely the FANG stocks. The four household names are plays on some of the hottest technology trends, including cloud computing, streaming media, smart homes and artificial intelligence. CNBC's \"Mad Money\" host Jim Cramer coined the acronym FANG in 2013 to collectively refer to the four high-growth internet stocks. The term caught on in part because headline writers love playing with the word. Some examples: \"The FANG Stocks Bite Back\" and \"FANGs Retracted: Netflix, Other Top Nets Lose Bite.\" Take the first letter of each stock and you get FANG. In October 2015, Google restructured and placed its legacy business under an umbrella corporation called Alphabet Inc. Alphabet is now the parent company of Google and subsidiaries like Chronicle, Verily and Waymo. But investors stuck with the acronym FANG rather than switch to FANA. Headline writers couldn't do much with the latter. Beyond FAANG stocks, other variations on FANG have been proposed. So far this year, through Nov. 27, it is up 49.1%. The ETF rebounded from the coronavirus stock market crash to reach an all-time high of 208.27 intraday on Nov. 27. The FANG stocks have been outperforming the broader stock market this year. Netflix stock has been consolidating for the past 19 weeks with a buy point of 575.47. It closed the regular session Nov. 27 at 491.36. Netflix stock has benefited from consumers turning to its service in record numbers for entertainment while self-quarantining during the Covid-19 pandemic. The companies in the FANG group are facing a host of pressures now. Amazon.com and Google have come under regulatory scrutiny for possible anti-competitive business practices. Facebook and Google have been criticized for lack of data privacy and security. And Netflix is confronting a flurry of new competitors in streaming video as well as a mounting debt load associated with content production. Facebook and Google have been hurt by a drop in advertising spending on their platforms during the coronavirus pandemic. Plus, a recession could negatively impact all four FANG stocks. Facebook is under pressure to moderate its platform better to weed out hate speech, fake news and other unwanted content. YOU MAY ALSO LIKE:"

I think we've gotten a taste of a lot of these things because of the circumstances, but something like telework, I've realized that my job can be done 100% remote. Something like telehealth, once you have been able to log onto a video and see your doctor from your couch, that may be something you're interested in doing even when there's not a pandemic just because you've experienced the convenience. I definitely see where you're going with that. Scott Helfstein: Similarly across all these areas, another one is online retail and I imagine we'll want to jump into some of the names there, but we saw e-commerce as a percentage total retail sales go from 11%to 16%, and new numbers should be out at some point this week. But to give everybody context, it took 10 years to go from 5% to 11%. It took a decade to reach 11% penetration. Ten years. So for all the people who think that Amazon is taking over everything, all of e-commerce is still only 16% of the pie. That doesn't suggest to me that all of a sudden, it's going to go back to 11. There's a whole lot more that it's going to capture and so it's just going to expand, not recede. Cardina: Definitely. So that we can get to all four, I'm just going to kind of speed through these digital consumers. Let's start with Amazon. Amazon stock is up 1,700% in ten years. Beyond e-commerce, it's got a lot going for it, its biggest growth driver being Amazon Web Services, the cloud, of course. Do you think that Amazon can do anything near a repeat performance when we're looking ahead to the next decade? How do you envision this as an investment today?"

    "article_text":"Here are three reasons investors should love the potential of Spotlight. Image source: Getty Images. TikTok appeals to a similar audience as Snapchat. By copying its main features -- the ability to embed music and an endless feed of content -- Snap is protecting itself against losing engagement to TikTok. Facebook successfully accomplished that strategy when it added Stories to Instagram. When Facebook launched Stories, the feature was less about winning over Snapchat users than it was about preventing Instagram users from leaving or spending less time on the platform. Half a billion daily active users later, it's a clear success. Snap has managed to continue growing Snapchat's user base over the past year despite TikTok's booming popularity. The company averaged 249 million daily users during the third quarter, up 18% year over year. Snap also reported increased engagement in key metrics like Snaps created per user. That's despite TikTok adding more than 50 million monthly active users in the U.S. from Oct. 2019 through June 2020. So Snap is doing a good job of growing users and keeping them engaged despite TikTok's growth, particularly among young people. But the addition of Spotlight should keep them in the Snapchat app. Spotlight has a lot of potential to increase engagement on Snapchat. It takes a behavior many users already do within the app -- make fun videos to share -- and provides another format for sharing and viewing them. That should lead to more people creating Snaps, and users spending more time viewing them (the $1 million per day giveaway to creators through the end of 2020 will help fuel that engagement too). Snap has always boasted strong engagement among younger users, but that engagement is often focused on less profitable behaviors like private messaging with friends. More recently, it has grown engagement through features like Shows in its Discover section, which are much more easily monetized. Snap should be able to monetize time spent viewing Spotlight at a much better rate than private messaging. The other opportunity is for Snap to expand on shopping ads with Spotlight. TikTok has explored adding shopping features in its app for creators to make commissions selling products. It aims to follow a similar road map to its Chinese counterpart Douyin, and that's part of what attracted Walmart to try to acquire a stake in the company. Snap already has a partnership with Amazon that it could build on with more shoppable features, and it could build on its dynamic product catalog ads. In the early days, Snap will aim to drive engagement with the format before it inserts advertisements, but the long-term potential is there. Look for Snap's investment in Spotlight and moderating public content to hit its bottom line in the near term, but it should see continued growth in its user base and engagement as it fends off TikTok.\u00a0"

The big concern for Walgreens is increasing competition in the pharmacy space. It already has to contend with the likes of CVS Health\u00a0and Rite Aid, and will now be going toe-to-toe with Amazon, which announced its entry into the pharmacy industry on Nov. 17. Amazon has deep pockets and isn't afraid to undercut its competition on price to gobble up market share, which clearly has Wall Street worried. Image source: Getty Images. What's great about Salesforce is that pretty much any company involved in sales is a potential client. While this logically includes retail, we find that companies involved in finance, manufacturing, and information technology are also utilizing CRM to a greater degree. Salesforce's ongoing innovation allows it to build on the solutions it's already providing its clients and further entrench its relationships. Or, in English, its clients are becoming ever-more reliant on CRM software and are less likely to jump ship to a competing CRM company. The point is, Salesforce is a fast-growing beast that's shed more than 12% since hitting an all-time high in late August. That's an early holiday gift for opportunistic long-term investors."

Underwhelming online sales numbers for Thanksgiving Day and Black Friday suggests sales at physical stores remain under severe strain as shoppers maintain a focus on their health. \u201cOur store capacity is capped at 150 people including staff, but we haven\u2019t come close to hitting that,\u201d a Best Buy employee at the store told Yahoo Finance. Despite some early gloom, however, there do appear several winners so far in the holiday shopping race. Online sales of pet products surged 254% on Black Friday from a year ago, Adobe Analytics said. The number isn\u2019t too much of a surprise as people have adopted pets at a record pace during the pandemic to provide some mental relief. About 20% of respondents to a July Nielsen survey said they adopted more dogs or cats between March and June. A year ago that number stood at less than 5%. Now all those new furry family additions need a holiday gift. Investing in one\u2019s home \u2014 whether that\u2019s installing new kitchen cabinets from Home Depot or 10 new Sonos smart speakers \u2014 has been one of the biggest investing themes of 2020. Adobe\u2019s holiday data suggests that theme is far from dying out. Online sales of smart home items exploded 592% on Black Friday, said Adobe. Amazon\u2019s Echo smart speaker was a top-seller, the report showed. And it\u2019s the personal care players likely selling creams and soaps that appear to be on track for a solid holiday season. Adobe\u2019s data showed a 556% online sales surge for personal care products on Black Friday. Consumers may be adding personal care items in their online checkout cart.

    "article_text":"(Bloomberg) -- Unions are trying to figure out how to protect their members from artificial intelligence programs they can\u2019t see and may not even be sure are really there. The U.K.\u2019s Trades Union Congress, an umbrella group for British unions representing more than 5.5 million people, is forming an AI taskforce to lobby employers and regulators to increase transparency around where the technology is being deployed, and to offer workers recourse if they believe they\u2019ve been discriminated against. Employees who spoke to the TUC said they\u2019re beginning to encounter AI in all areas of their working life, from submitting their resumes and interviewing for jobs to getting shifts, customer queries and vacations assigned and having their performance analyzed. The TUC\u2019s concern is that flaws in enterprise AI will result in unfair outcomes or discrimination for employees. And if that happens, managers may not question the programs\u2019 output or be willing to negotiate. \u201cWe realized that essentially there\u2019s a revolution taking place in the world of work in terms of the use of AI to manage people,\u201d said Mary Towers, an employment rights policy officer at the TUC who\u2019s leading the effort. \u201cWhat we\u2019re really talking about is the use of AI to make decisions that really impact significantly on people\u2019s job opportunities and the nature and fabric of their working lives.\u201d That worry is exacerbated by a lack of transparency, the TUC said in the report. A large proportion of employees don\u2019t know whether their companies are even using the technology and most wouldn\u2019t know what to do if they thought AI had treated them unfairly. The U.K. government\u2019s Centre for Data Ethics and Innovation published a report on Friday that showed just 14% of more than 2,000 people surveyed thought they\u2019d know if AI had made an automated decision about a job application. Only 17% said they\u2019d know who to complain to if they thought that decision was unfair. A lack of understanding and trust in the technology may also be preventing businesses from deploying AI tools. About 42% of employers surveyed by Ipsos, in a study published in July for the European Commission, said they used at least one type of AI technology, including tools for automating tasks and detecting fraud, and 18% plan to add it in the next two years. Still, the Ipsos study found significant barriers to its growth, including fear of liability for damages if something goes wrong and \u201clack of citizens\u2019 trust in the technology.\u201d The TUC wants to work with unions to find ways to negotiate on technology used in workplaces and to increase transparency about where AI is operating and to give employees more knowledge and control over what personal data is being collected and used. The group plans to publish a guide for unions on dealing with the technology next year. \u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P."

    "article_text":"(Corrects name of brand to 'Vivobarefoot' from 'Vivo Barefoot' in paragraph 11) By Victoria Waldersee LISBON, Nov 30 (Reuters) - Retailers worldwide have never had more reason to pack warehouses to the brim and keep stock closer to shoppers who continue to buy a record number of items online. As well as stocking up for Christmas and any potential coronavirus-related lockdowns, Europe and the UK will soon have Brexit to deal with. British companies are bringing as much as possible into the country before potential disruptions in January, while their European counterparts are piling up goods in pan-European distribution hubs close to ports like Hamburg or Rotterdam. E-commerce management platforms including ZigZag and Global-e-- which serve Forever 21, Boohoo, Gap, Selfridges and Hugo Boss --- said around 30-35% of UK retailers' sales are to customers in continental Europe. Brands popular in the UK like Chinese e-commerce retailer Shein or American sportswear brand Under Armour are currently stocked exclusively in the EU, ZigZag CEO Al Gerrie said. The rise in e-commerce throughout the year as a consequence of the pandemic had already pushed warehouse space to the limit. \"Most carriers already operated at Christmas volumes during the first wave. If you now add the Christmas effect on top, it's just getting even more challenging,\" CFO of European e-commerce retailer Zalando, David Schroeder, said in November. Demand for storage space after Brexit could shoot up even further as retailers seek to avoid customs checks and, if no deal is struck, tariffs. \"Retailers won't want to be caught out again,\" said Nick Cook, head of Europe for warehouse owner GLP, referring to the potential supply shocks Brexit could bring. Their warehouses, covering 3.3 million square metres in continental Europe and 700,000 in the UK leased to companies including H&M, Amazon and DHL are currently 97% occupied. STOCKING UP In the UK, leasing volumes for commercial warehouse space are at record levels of 32.5 million square feet and projected to grow to 40 million by the end of the year, according to real estate advisory firm CBRE. Logistics operator Europa Worldwide Group, which delivers goods for retailers and third parties like DHL and Amazon, is holding 60% more e-commerce products than this time last year, the company said. Shoe producer Vivobarefoot said it was shipping as many shoes as possible from its Portugal manufacturing site to its UK warehouse ahead of December. M&S, Next, and Primark said earlier this year their warehouses were still holding unsold summer clothing. Even after the pandemic, demand for warehouse space is expected to remain high as customers now used to ordering online continue to do so. E-commerce generally requires around three times as much warehouse capacity as physical retail, according to figures from Prologis. SPREADING OUT Warehouse developer Panattoni Chief Executive Robert Dobrzycki said pandemic border closures spurred retailers to separate stock by country instead of stocking for several countries in one shared warehouse space. \"We're seeing a move away from just-in-time logistics strategies and increasingly towards just-in-case,\" said Andrew Jones of property firm Londonmetric in a November earnings call. \"Not only in the period we're all living through at the moment, but also the period we're going to live through post-Brexit.\" Retailers could also seek to split logistics operations across the UK and EU to avoid charges. Even with a deal, cross-border traders will have to pay charges on goods travelling between the UK and EU and track every order with commercial paperwork. Britain\u2019s logistics industry estimates that 250 million customs declarations a year will be needed for EU trade. Holding stock in both markets would eliminate that problem and is a solution the biggest players have opted for. Amazon said in July that from December 28 onwards it would no longer distribute goods for merchants between the UK and the EU \u2013 instead, they would have to send their stock separately to fulfilment centres in both regions. Meanwhile other industry players are beginning to discuss options like converting agricultural buildings, empty space on run-down high streets or vacant basements into warehouse space, according to research by firms including Savills and JLL . But the construction and conversion process is slow and has been hit by delays during the pandemic and many plans are still a pipe dream. \"At this point, you may just need to choose your market,\" Tim Crighton, head of EMEA at real estate advisory Cushman & Wakefield, said. Parker Lane Group, a UK-based returns facility with offices in Barcelona and Warsaw, said some clients were positioning goods to mitigate tariffs but others said very few of their customers had made any arrangements yet. \"Retailers haven't pulled the trigger just yet, because of the uncertainty around Brexit,\" Al Gerrie of ZigZag said. By the time they do, there may not be much space left to lease. \"If people want warehousing today, you're looking at older, second-hand, more functionally awkward space, without the same height or loading doors of newbuilds,\u201d Paul Weston, head of Prologis for the UK, said.

    "article_text":"S&P Dow Jones Indices officials said it consulted investors about how Tesla stock would be added to the index. The automaker has a market capitalization of more than $500 billion, making it the largest company ever to be added to the index. S&P Dow Jones mulled adding Tesla stock\u00a0 in two tranches to ease integration. But the committee decided to add the stock all at once at its full float-adjusted market cap before the open of trading on Dec. 21. That means they will weight the company based only on shares available to the public. \"The fact the S&P Dow Jones Index Committee solicited feedback from the investment community about how to add the stock to the S&P 500 Index shows how unusual this situation is,\" said CFRA Research senior analyst Gerrett Nelson in a note. In its decision, S&P DJI considered also Tesla's expected liquidity and the market's ability to accommodate significant trading volumes. \"Adding the stock at the upcoming December quarterly rebalancing coincides with the expiration of stock options, stock futures, stock-index options and stock-index futures, which may help facilitate the funding trade,\" the index provider said in a news release. Tesla's addition to the S&P 500 will be based on the closing prices of Friday, Dec. 18. The company that Tesla will replace will be named after the market closes on Dec. 11. Analyst Nelson says the move to the S&P 500 will spark a flurry of funding trades in Tesla Stock. Its inclusion means investment funds indexed to the S&P 500 will have to sell about $51 billion worth of shares of companies already in the S&P 500 and use that money to buy shares of Tesla, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. Tesla will account for about 1% of the index. In addition, actively managed investment funds that try to beat the S&P 500 may buy more Tesla shares, too. Such funds manage trillions of dollars in assets. \"We expect TSLA shares to continue to get bid up over the next few weeks as funds are forced to add the stock, which we think will result in multiple expansion and a further widening of its cost of capital advantage relative to other automakers,\" Nelson said. Tesla is pitching Cybertruck reservation holders on leasing another Tesla vehicle as the company tries to hit 500,000 deliveries. Notably, Tesla explicitly said Cybertruck deliveries won't begin until early 2022, later than official targets for a late 2021 launch. \"The single motor configuration is currently scheduled to begin production in late 2022 with delivery projected to take place in early 2023,\" Tesla said in the email to Cybertruck reservation holders. \"The dual and tri-motor configurations are currently scheduled to begin production in late 2021 with delivery projected to take place in early 2022.\" Pitching 24-36 month leases to reservation holders is another indication of how long it might be before Cybertruck deliveries get going. CEO Elon Musk had hinted that the Cybertruck wouldn't come until 2022 because it needs future battery improvements. Also, the electric still doesn't have a final, street-legal design. That might come in the next several weeks. The Tesla Cybertruck will be made at a new plant outside Austin, Texas. That plant, due to be up and running in late 2021, will also make the Model Y and upcoming Tesla Semi. The long-touted Semi also may need future battery improvements. On Monday, Tesla stock set a record high at 607.80 before reversing lower. Analyst Nelson remains bullish on TSLA stock. \"The ongoing run-up means that TSLA's cost of capital advantage relative to peers continues to widen,\" he said. This is key because Tesla continues to build new factories and deliver on its goal of increasing annual auto volumes by 40 times over the next decade from about 500,000 units this year to 20 million by 2030, he added.

    "article_text":"The sales gains and the upbeat outlook from Goldman come as demand for electric vehicles in China rebounds this year. Nio said it delivered 5,291 vehicles last month, a 109% jump. The company said it was \"in the process\" of speeding up production capacity expansion this month to handle the increase in orders. Xpeng delivered 4,224 smart electric vehicles in November, a 342% increase. The company's smart sports sedan, the P7, led the gains. The P7 competes against the made-in-China Tesla Model 3. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs raised its price target on Li Auto to 60 from 20.60 and on Nio to 59 from 7.70. They also upgraded Nio stock to neutral, from sell. Goldman predicted that electric vehicle penetration in China would reach 20% by 2025, up from 5% this year. It sees that penetration reaching 53% in 2035 and 80% in 2050. Xpeng stock sank 7.5%. XPEV has an 87 Composite Rating. Tesla recently expanded manufacturing capacity it its Shanghai Giga factory to begin producing the Model Y. The U.S. electric-vehicle maker also sells its Model 3 cars in China. Goldman's EV stocks analysts said they believed Li Auto was \"differentiating itself from the broader Chinese auto-making industry by envisioning and creating compelling EV consumer experiences \u2014 and showing a willingness to take on the risk of unconventional technologies and act innovatively.\" They added that the company's Li One vehicle, launched last year, was the bestselling electric SUV in China. The analysts said they expected Li Auto to use the Li One as a platform for offering autonomous driving, among other things, that would help drive longer-term adoption. Goldman also said the Li One had the largest interior space of any top-selling electric vehicle in China, and a longer driving range. For Nio, the EV stocks analysts said their downgrade to sell, in July, was based on a belief that \"the share price at the time reflected over-optimism given no substantial changes to volume\/profit expectations.\" \"In hindsight,\" the analysts continued, \"we underestimated the benefits to Nio from: (1) powertrain breakthroughs, particularly with the cell-to-pack\/blade large cell technologies; (2) the introduction of Nio's battery as a service (BaaS) program, which has significantly expanded Nio's addressable market; and (3) regulatory incentives that turned around EV market demand from an ongoing decline.\" Nio's battery as a service program, launched in August, allows drivers to buy a car without a battery, but subscribe to different battery packs, based on their needs, on a monthly basis.

    "article_text":"Tesla shares were higher on Tuesday after S&P Dow Jones Indices announced late Monday it would be added to the S&P 500 index all at once on Dec. 21. MYLES UDLAND: All right. A company we also talk quite a bit about here on Yahoo Finance is Tesla. They're set to join the S&P 500 to begin trading on December 21. A rebalance will happen on Friday, December 18. And Julie Hyman, this is going to be the largest rebalance that-- or the largest requirement of trading volume that has ever happened for a company entering the S&P. And as we discussed back when the news was initially announced that they'd be joining, they are going to be what? The tenth largest, ninth largest company within the index upon inclusion. JULIE HYMAN: Yeah, I think they've actually moved up by now, Myles. I think they're something like seven or eight at this point. I was looking at the numbers from Howard Silverblatt over at S&P, which he sent after the decision and the announcement were made. He said, if you adjust the current market value for float, you get $437 billion. That would produce $72.7 billion in required trades because of the various companies that the various managers that index to the S&P 500. He says, in addition to the normal rebalancing trades of that day, which were $32 billion for September, the last time there was a rebalancing. So, it looks like you could just have an enormous, enormous amount of trading volume that day, spurred partly by Tesla and partly by other types of rebalancing. BRIAN SOZZI: Julie, my analysis this morning on Tesla is very simple, and this is the Yahoo Finance Premium stat of the day-- PE ratio trailing on Tesla, now 1,085. And all these momentum traders in Tesla buying the stock ahead of-- ahead of them joining the S&P 500, I get it. There's a lot of momentum. This is what you do. You trade that momentum, and maybe you put on more gains. But at some point, Myles and Julie, valuations on Tesla will have to matter. And it might matter now that the company is going to be part of the S&P 500, and it might matter on that fourth quarter earnings call. MYLES UDLAND: Sozzi, they have a PE. That's-- that's-- that's an improvement for Tesla, being able at least-- BRIAN SOZZI: 1,085. Sick, insane. MYLES UDLAND: You can at least-- you can at least do the math now, dividing by something like earnings. And just to-- to wrap up the point there, Tesla will be the seventh largest company in the S&P 500 upon inclusion. The market cap right now is only $20 billion less than Berkshire Hathaway's. They're currently the sixth largest company within the S&P 500. So, another decent day for Tesla, and all of a sudden it's-- it's only the FAAMG games, FAAMG including the M, with Microsoft ahead of them-- that would be Facebook, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, and of course, Apple sitting right over $2 trillion in market capital."

Jacob Ma-Weaver, manager of multi-strategy fund Cable Car Capital, told Yahoo Finance he first became acquainted with Tripp after reading about the dispute in the media and seeing his GoFundMe page. \u201cI really believe firmly that all litigants deserve to compete on an equal playing field. And that's one of the unfortunate parts of our justice system \u2014 that really is not always the case. And this to me was one of those classic David versus Goliath situations,\u201d Ma-Weaver told Yahoo Finance. Ma-Weaver, a financial analyst, said his firm invests in litigation, occasionally, and generally where he has personal expertise and knowledge to bring to bear about the situation, and where there is a party who has financial constraints that prevent them from accessing the justice system. \u201c[Tripp] had the same right to defense and ability to prosecute counterclaims as anyone else,\u201d Ma-Weaver said, adding that the relationship between Tripp and Cable Car Capital ended when Tripp violated the terms of the litigation funding agreement. \u201cI think it's very clear in a situation like this where you have a giant company suing an individual for everything he\u2019s worth, and then some, even in the context of counterclaims, it can be quite difficult for them to obtain representation that\u2019s on a purely contingency basis. And where I think litigation funding can often bridge the gap is in the situations where the risk profile to the attorneys of representing an indigent individual is too high. So funding, like any provision of capital, is a way to change the balance of risk sharing, so that it's not entirely on one party or another,\u201d Ma-Weaver said. \u201cIf Tripp had had the resources himself to fund the case he never would have sought funding, full stop.\u201d In September, the court granted Tesla\u2019s motion to do away with the counterclaims asserted by Tripp, alleging that the company\u2019s CEO Elon Musk, and others at Tesla, defamed him and cast him in a false light in various emails and tweets. Yahoo Finance has requested comment from Tesla, as well as from Tripp, and will update this story with responses it receives. \u201cIn the brief period of trading that took place between the publication of each of the June 4 Article and June 6 Article and the close of the NASDAQ trading day, Tesla\u2019s market capitalization declined by $34 million and $134 million, respectively, or $167 million in total over those two short time windows,\u201d the filing said. In August 2019, Tripp\u2019s then-lawyer, Robert Mitchell, told Yahoo Finance, \u201cThese are phantom damages in our view.\u201d Tesla characterized Tripp as an underperforming former employee who became disgruntled after he was fired from the company.

    "article_text":"(Bloomberg) -- Tesla Inc. climbed on Tuesday after S&P Dow Jones Indices said it will be added to the S&P 500 Index in one shot on Dec. 21, a move that will ripple through the entire market as money managers adjust their portfolios to make room for shares of the $538 billion company. Investors in the electric vehicle maker welcomed the simpler process, sending Tesla shares up 1.7% to $577.284 at 10:42 a.m. New York time. The stock, which closed at a record high on Friday, is up about 578% this year. \u201cThis is a better outcome than what investors overall had expected,\u201d said Gary Black, a private investor who used to be the chief executive of Aegon Asset Management, noting that there was a \u201cnon-zero\u201d probability that S&P might delay one piece of the listing into next year, and that the latest announcement takes that off the table. Given Tesla\u2019s massive market size, S&P consulted with investors in November, asking for feedback on whether the stock should be folded into the index all at once or in two parts, which would have been unprecedented. The electric-vehicle maker would be the seventh-biggest company in the S&P 500 at its current market value, falling between Berkshire Hathaway Inc. and Visa Inc. With about $11 trillion in funds tied to the S&P 500, money managers have been looking toward a few busy weeks ahead no matter how Tesla was included in the index. Whether it was one fell swoop or two separate tranches, managers of index-tracking funds would still have had to offload stocks of several other companies to make room for the mammoth newcomer in their portfolios. \u201cIt looks like they\u2019re ripping the band-aid off,\u201d said Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers. \u201cIt\u2019s ultimately less disruptive than trying something new with the largest index addition ever.\u201d S&P Dow Jones Indices, announcing the plan in a brief statement Monday, said it will make public on Dec. 11 which company Tesla will replace in the index. The index provider said it will release a full statement on Tuesday morning. Adding the company in the traditional way is \u201csimple and easy to understand\u201d Black said. After the initial buying of Tesla into the Dec. 21 inclusion, the stock may pull back, if history is any guide, according to Black. The shares may fall about 10% to 20%, a pattern that would be consistent with what happened to Facebook after its entry into the S&P 500 seven years ago.

The payment by Martin Tripp, a former process technician at Tesla's Gigafactory near Reno, Nevada, was part of a settlement disclosed on Monday and approved that day by Chief Judge Miranda Du of the federal court in Reno. Tesla and Musk became embroiled in a public dispute with Tripp in June 2018, when it fired and then sued him.

Moderna and Pfizer both rallied on vaccine expectations. EV makers Nio and Xpeng jumped on deliveries news and an analyst upgrade. Leaderboard stock PayPal broke past a buy point, while Salesforce.com fell to the bottom of the Dow Jones today, ahead of its afterhours earnings report. Zoom stock is in its fourth week below its 10-week moving average, after pulling back from a late-October high. Markets across Asia rebounded briskly on Tuesday. Official data in China showed factory activity expanding in November at the fastest pace since September 2017, despite lockdowns tightening in Hong Kong and Shanghai as the country faces its fourth wave of coronavirus infections. The Shanghai Composite jumped 1.8% on Tuesday. The composite rose 5.1% for November, ending just below its high for the year, set in July. In Japan, Tokyo's Nikkei 225 rebounded 1.3% on Tuesday after a dip on Monday left the index with a 15% gain in November. Europe's markets rallied higher Tuesday, bouncing back after a down day on Monday. In afternoon trade on Tuesday, the CAC-40 in Paris climbed 1% and London's FTSE 100 hustled up a 1.7% advance. For November, the CAC-40 scored a 20% advance, Frankfurt's DAX rallied 15%. Oil prices eased slightly, with West Texas Intermediate holding above $45 a barrel, after ministers of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries delayed a production decision until Thursday in order to meet with Russian counterparts. Industry watchers had anticipated a vote on Monday to trim production curbs, effectively increasing the group's output by two million barrels per day. With demand outlooks still calling for oil demand weakness due to coronavirus pandemic issues in 2021, Saudi Arabia is reportedly among the countries supporting an extension of the current production cuts, totaling 7.7 million barrel per day, into early 2021 \u2014 a move likely to keep upward price pressure on oil. \u00a0 November saw some healthy moves among blue chips, as the index powered up to an 11.8% gain for the month \u2014 its best month since January 1987. Eleven of the 30 Dow Jones stocks outpaced the overall index for the month. It's no surprise that Boeing was the curve bender, erupting in a 45.9% rebound that marked the stock's biggest jump since a 48% bounce in August of 1982.

    "article_text":"Matt Maley, Miller Tabak Managing Director and Equity Strategist joins Yahoo Finance Live to weigh in on what\u2019s moving markets during the pandemic. - We are still joined by Matt Maley. He is an Equity Strategist and Managing Director over at Miller Tabak. And Matt, I'd love to kind of move away from equities for just a second and talk about what I'm sure you're getting questions on, which is Bitcoin and what's happening in the crypto space. And I'm just curious what those conversations are like now for you, versus what they were in 2017, and kind of what your thoughts are on as Bitcoin as an asset and crypto as an asset class. MATT MALEY: Well, you know, it's funny, because back in 2017, I was like, this is ridiculous. It got to about this level, and I said, you ought to sell it with both hands, take profits. It worked out really well, and I just didn't believe it. I didn't understand it. There was a lot of different things. But now, especially in the last 8 to 10 months, I've changed significantly on a long term basis. I think that this is something that can go a lot higher. However, nothing moves in a straight line. And some of the people get a bit worried here. And I've been saying recently, I said, you know, it could get to 20,000, even between 20,000 and 22,000. But we're getting ripe for a 30% correction that we seem to frequently get in this. And people say, well, the euphoria is not there like it was in 2017. There's a lot of bullishness, but not quite the crazy euphoria. I was like, well, that's great. But all that really tells you is that it's probably not going to go down 80%. It doesn't mean it can't go down 20% to 30% at any given time. I mean, just look at Amazon. Amazon went down 90% after the tech bubble burst. The euphoria has never gotten back to that level. But it's had many-- I mean, it's probably had a dozen or close to a dozen declines of 30% to 40% since then. When stocks get incredibly, or any asset gets incredibly overbought, and sentiment gets incredibly bullish, it can and does see steep corrections. And so people need to be a little bit careful up at these levels. I like it better back down the $15,000 to $16,000 level right now. For those who own it, I'm not saying you should sell it, because I do like it long term. But traders should take some profits, and I think those who own it and want to buy more will get a chance to buy it at lower levels sometime in the next month or so. BRIAN SOZZI: Matt, I've read a lot of your notes this year. And you've highlighted Tesla's run through it all. What percentage, how much more upside, do you think Tesla has left, as it gets included into the S&P 500? 10%? 20%? Can it double? What are you thinking? Because we're really seeing a melt up here in the stock. MATT MALEY: Yeah, I mean, it's funny. Pre-split I was saying with the stock at below 200, I was like, pound the table, you've got to own this thing. Now all-time highs. You know, fundamentally, it's just not there. I mean, I guess my point is, there's opportunities out there in the marketplace where you can make with a lot less risk. Maybe you won't be able to make as much money as you will in Tesla from these levels. Again, I'm not talking about if you bought it when the stock was at $200 or $50 or whatever. Of course, it's been an unbelievable stock. And the company, it's the same situation. There are not the same risks we had two years ago in this company. That doesn't mean there aren't any risks. And that doesn't mean that there aren't-- this stock is going to see some significant declines over time. Again, if you're a long term believer, you want to hold it, that's great. But I think for those who want to add to it, same thing. It's just got the valuations have become out of control. And it's one thing to-- these stay-at-home stocks, people were paying high valuations for some of those names, nothing like they are right now for Tesla. Tesla is not going to change the world to that degree, in my opinion. But maybe I'm wrong. We'll see. - All right, Matt Maley with Miller Tabak. Matt, great to have you on the show, always fun to get your thoughts. I know we'll talk soon. MATT MALEY: Thank you very much. Have a great one."

    "url":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/vw-bets-porsche-racecar-engineer-134903327.html",
    "article_text":"By Edward Taylor, Jan Schwartz and J\u00f6rn Poltz FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Alexander Hitzinger, a 49-year-old engineer who defected to Apple after helping to develop Porsche's winning 919 racecar, has been lured back to Volkswagen Group for perhaps his biggest challenge yet - building an electric car to take on Tesla. While Volkswagen, the world's largest automaker, has been rolling out electric vehicles from the ID.3 compact to the high end Porsche Taycan, analysts say it needs a more comprehensive system that integrates electric power with new self-driving and infotainment technologies if it hopes to overtake Tesla. It has turned to Hitzinger, whose ability to conceptualise clean-sheet designs and manage projects helped Porsche develop a racecar that won the Le Mans endurance race in 2015, 2016, 2017. After a stint working on Apple's autonomous cars, Hitzinger now heads up Volkswagen's \"Project Artemis\", named after the Ancient Greek goddess of hunting, with the aim of chasing down electric car pioneer Tesla. \"At Porsche, I always thought of a vehicle as a comprehensive system. This is a very important point. It is what Tesla does well,\" he explained in a video interview. The task of building a car has gotten more complex with the advent of electric and autonomous driving technologies, forcing new battery-driven powertrains to compete for electricity with camera, radar, and lidar sensors, plus infotainment systems. Rather than stitching together separately designed systems, Artemis wants to create something new and seamlessly integrated, from the ground up, Hitzinger told Reuters. \"The idea behind Artemis is to have a comprehensive understanding of the vehicle. When something is optimised, this has knock-on effects and these need to be understood.\" Allocating processing power between propulsion, automated driving and infotainment systems such as satellite navigation and music streaming is a key challenge, he said. But it's not the only one. \"The human-machine interface, the interior design, the exterior design, aerodynamics and the range are all interconnected. If I modify something on the exterior, it will impact the aerodynamics and the efficiency,\" Hitzinger said. Volkswagen Group, whose brands range from budget Seats and Skodas to high-end Audis and Bentleys is now focussing on developing systems that can handle all these new demands. The car, which is due to be produced in 2024, will make use of components developed for Porsche and Audi's premium electric vehicle platform, PPE. The group's factory in Hanover, Germany, is being retooled to build an electric sport-utility vehicle for Audi, Bentley and Porsche. Having a small team of highly qualified engineers, who are empowered to take decisions unencumbered by the corporate bureaucracy of the Volkswagen empire, should end up producing a better vehicle more quickly. Project Artemis will have between 200 and 250 staff once Hitzinger is done hiring, up from 10 at present. \"I am putting the team together on a top down basis. The managers come first. Then I look for A-players, who will attract other A-players. I don't want managers, but people who love to develop technologies, who are prepared to take risks,\" he said. Artemis will seek to draw on existing skills within the Volkswagen Group, such as expertise in making vehicle bodies at Audi, but take the lead in developing new techniques which speed up production and improve the customer experience. \"We want to set new standards for what a customer can do in a vehicle and how he interacts with the car,\" Hitzinger said. He declined to elaborate on what user experiences the new car would offer, citing the confidential nature of the project. He also declined to comment on a power struggle unfolding at Volkswagen, which has convened its executive committee to meet on Tuesday to decide whether to extend CEO Herbert Diess's contract.

The videoconferencing leader guided higher for Q4 and for 2021. However, Zoom Video stock fell 7% in premarket action. Shares rose 1.4% to 478.36 on Monday, reclaiming the 50-day line. Giving a boost to Qualcomm and Qorvo stock, Apple stock rose 2.1% to 119.05, though it backed off an intraday high of 120.97. Loop Capital upgraded Apple to a buy with a 131 price target, expecting upside to iPhone sales and other products and services. Morgan Stanley tapped the iPhone maker as a strong 5G play. An aggressive investor could start an AAPL stock position here, then perhaps add more shares as it clears the 122.09 and 125.49 levels and finally the 138.08 buy point. Apple stock has slightly lagged the broader market for the past few months. If the tech giant can wake up, it would add real momentum to the major indexes. Apple stock rose 2% before the open. Tesla stock rose nearly 5% early Tuesday on the S&P Dow Jones Indices' decision to add the EV maker to the S&P 500 index in one go. Because of Tesla's huge market cap, the committee had mulled splitting the stock's entry into two tranches. Tesla stock has skyrocketed since the announcement that Tesla will join the S&P 500 before the open on Dec. 21. Meanwhile, Tesla got China's official green light on Monday to sell the Model Y from its Shanghai plant, as expected. Tesla stock briefly rose to a new high of 607.80 soon after Monday's open before reversing for a 3.1% decline to 567.30. Nio delivered 5,291 electric vehicles in November, up 109% vs. a year earlier. That includes 2,386 ES6s, 1,387 ES8s and 1,518 EC6s. The recently launched EC6 crossover will compete with the Tesla Model Y when that launches. Xpeng delivered 4,224 electric vehicles, up 342% vs. a year earlier. That includes 2,732 P7 sedans, which competes with the Tesla Model 3. Xpeng also sold 1,492 G3s, its small SUV. Li Auto will likely release November delivery figures in the next few days. Goldman Sachs raised its price targets on Nio and Li Auto stock for good measure. Overall China EV production and sales, including Tesla figures will probably come next week. Nio stock rose 2% early Tuesday. Xpeng rallied 5% and Li Auto stock 8%. On Monday, Nio sank 6.4% while Li Auto and Xpeng stock lost nearly 9% on a bad day for U.S.-listed Chinese stocks. Kandi Technologies tumbled 28% after short-seller Hindenburg Research accused the Chinese EV maker of fraudulent sales. YOU MAY ALSO LIKE:"

    "article_text":"The selling seen off the open yesterday didn\u2019t last long as S&P futures started grinding higher after the close. From there, buying hasn\u2019t stopped and stocks look to open the month right at all-time highs. The momentum higher looks to take us above the all-time high print of 3668 in the S&P futures. This was the spike seen after the vaccine news early in November. The question for the bulls is if there is \u201cfresh powder\u201d all the way to 3700, or will profit takers step in. Potential news might have some influence as ISM manufacturing will come in later this morning. Additionally, Fed Chair Powell and Treasury Secretary Mnuchin will be in front of congress today in a hearing on COVID-19. Investors should watch for comments on the need for stimulus, as both men can influence some movement on a COVID relief package. S&P Futures Trading Levels The S&P futures currently sit at 3360, just eight handles below the all-time high print. Support levels for the day will be 3650 and 3626. Upside resistance is 3685 and 3706. The current S&P trading environment is breaking out higher. The 21-day MA for the S&P 500 is at 3535 and the 50-day is 3450. While we are extended far beyond the MA\u2019s, Fibonacci targets above will likely draw the market into the 3730-50 range. Three Stocks to Watch  TSLA- Tesla sold off yesterday as there were worries that the S&P addition would be done in two tranches. However, an announcement last night confirmed the liquidity would be acceptable and it can all be done on December 21st. Tesla will be the seventh biggest S&P company after the additon, so traders are trying to get ahead of all that buying that has to happen. The stock is up almost 5% premarket. ZM- Zoom Video reported a big beat of $0.99 v the $0.75 expected. The company guided Q4 higher and raise FY21. It was no surprise that the company would perform this quarter, but there are worries in what kind of growth the company will see when economies open up. The stock is trading down over 6% premarket. GBTC\/Bitcoin\u2013 Bitcoin is trying to break all time highs and is trading just under $20,000 in the futures contract. It has been quite the run for bitcoin, which is up over 100% since September. The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) is one way to get exposure without having to directly buy bitcoin. Investors in GBTC have been rewarded this year, seeing gains of about 130%. Biggest Tech Breakthrough in a GenerationBe among the early investors in the new type of device that experts say could impact society as much as the discovery of electricity. Current technology will soon be outdated and replaced by these new devices. In the process, it\u2019s expected to create 22 million jobs and generate $12.3 trillion in activity.A select few stocks could skyrocket the most as rollout accelerates for this new tech.

    "article_text":"Tesla Inc. TSLA recently procured an official permission to start selling its Shanghai-made Model Y series of sports utility vehicle (SUV) in China.Tesla\u2019s flagship model in China \u2014 Model Y \u2014 has been recently registered officially with the nation\u2019s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT). Chinese regulators at the MIIT published the sales approval on its website this Monday.The Model Y is an all-electric, mid-sized SUV, with seating capacity up to seven, equipped with cylindrical nickel, cobalt and manganese (NCM) batteries. It is the second model Tesla will manufacture at its Giga Factory in Shanghai, China, following the Model 3 sedan. Earlier this month, the company started boosting the production capacity of its Shanghai Giga factory so it could commence producing the Model Y vehicles there. The Shanghai factory is slated to roll out its first Model Y cars in early 2021.Tesla currently sells its Model 3 electric vehicles (EV) in China. The Shanghai Giga factory began production last October and sold its first made-in-China Tesla cars, the Model 3 series, to Chinese customers in December the same year. The company, in fact, delivered more than 12,000 Model 3 vehicles in the country in October this year. The EV giant has also started exporting China-made Model 3 cars to Europe as well as plans to develop electric vehicle chargers in China in 2021.Tesla\u2019s Giga Factory was waiting for a production permit to mass produce the Model Y. Now that the red-hot EV maker has obtained the sales permit from MIIT, it can commence mass production of Model Y. Tesla China\u2019s goal is to manufacture 550,000 units in 2021, out of which 250,000 Model Y vehicles need to be produced next year. Given that 2021 will be the first year Giga Shanghai attempts to produce the Model Y, building 250,000 units of Model Y SUV would be quite a challenge for the company.\u00a0Moreover, if the Shanghai Giga Factory is able to meet its target, Tesla \u2014 currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) \u2014 could produce 1 million cars in a year in 2021, achieving another milestone. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. Currently, China is the world\u2019s biggest EV market and the country has been head strong in its transition toward a green future.\u00a0 Importantly, the country aims electric cars to account for 25% of the new car sales by 2025 and kick start an era of green transportation. Amid this transforming scenario, automakers in China are fast changing gears to electric. Despite the coronavirus pandemic rattling the auto sector, China's EV space has been witnessing a boom as one after another carmakers have reported new highs in monthly and quarterly deliveries.Reportedly, Tesla\u2019s share of China\u2019s EV market was 21% during the first six months of 2020 compared with the prior year\u2019s 6%. Tesla regained its Chinese market share once it started selling domestically-produced vehicles in China in late 2019 as those were 13% cheaper for Chinese consumers than the vehicles imported from the United States. In the first nine months of 2020, China accounted for 19% of Tesla\u2019s top line compared with the 12% reported in the corresponding period of 2019.\u00a0Even with its dominant market share in the mainland, the California-based automaker faces stiff competition from Chinese electric vehicle firms like the Shanghai-based electric startup NIO Inc. NIO.Further, Chinese companies like XPeng Inc. XPEV and Li Auto LI, both of which debuted on U.S. exchanges recently, are also capitalizing on this trending EV hype.\u00a0 Imagine getting in early on a young industry primed to skyrocket from $17.7 billion in 2019 to an expected $73.6 billion by 2027.Although marijuana stocks did better as the pandemic took hold than the market as a whole, they\u2019ve been pushed down. This is exactly the right time to get in on selected strong companies at a fraction of their value before COVID struck.

    "article_text":"Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities told clients in a note the news \u201cwill be viewed as a clear negative.\u201d \u201cThis went from a game changer deal for Nikola to a good supply partnership but nothing to write home about and the Street will be disappointed accordingly along with lingering lockup worries,\u201d Ives wrote. Ives reiterated his Underperform rating and $15 price target on Nikola\u2019s stock. Investor attention now turns to new Nikola CEO and veteran manufacturing executive Mark Russell, who will have to likely move faster than he would have liked to raise fresh capital. While Nikola ended the third quarter with $907 million in cash, it could be burned through quickly given the company\u2019s losses ($235 million operating loss through the third quarter) and infrastructure build out plans. In August, Nikola broke ground on a 1 million-square-foot, $600 million manufacturing plant in Arizona. The plant is the linchpin in Nikola beginning to address a backlog of semi-truck orders reportedly north of 14,000. Finishing the plant and building giant electric trucks from it will require a great deal of cash. Further capital will likely be needed to support the rollout of semi-truck charging stations because as of now, Nikola hasn\u2019t secured a partner for them. \u201cWe believe a capital raise is in the cards as with GM scaling down its partnership we see Nikola needing to tap the capital markets to strengthen its cash position. The company has major ambitions which require significant resources and partnerships over the coming years to accomplish its hydrogen fuel cell goals,\u201d Ives told Yahoo Finance via email. Given Nikola has never produced a truck, has never turned a profit and has endured a trying few months of headlines (from the exit of founder Trevor Milton to an SEC inquiry) any capital injection could be on very unfriendly terms for shareholders.

    "article_text":"By Jan Schwartz and Edward Taylor FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Volkswagen, the world's largest vehicle maker by sales, risked a leadership crisis on Tuesday after Chief Executive Herbert Diess forced a vote of confidence in his reform efforts by asking for an early contract extension. The multi-brand car and truck maker is convening its Executive Committee to discuss Diess's demand for the contract extension, long before his current term comes to an end in 2023, three sources told Reuters on Monday. Volkswagen Chairman Hans Dieter Poetsch is seeking to avert a clash between labour leaders and Diess by postponing discussions about a contract extension, a person familiar with the matter said. Diess, who defected from BMW in 2015, and helped Volkswagen to reform after its diesel scandal with a 73 billion euro ($87 billion) electric vehicle investment plan, has grown frustrated with German labour leaders blocking cost cuts. The supervisory board's Executive Committee, which is headed by Poetsch, and includes Wolfgang Porsche and Hans Michel Piech, members of the carmaker's owning families, as well as labour boss Bernd Osterloh, is due to meet on Tuesday, the three sources told Reuters. Volkswagen declined to comment. \"The families continue to support Diess,\" a spokesman for Porsche Automobil Holding SE, the company which holds a majority voting stake in Volkswagen said on Tuesday. The meeting comes on the day that Tesla's CEO Elon Musk is due to receive the Axel Springer award in Berlin for his achievements in engineering, after the electric carmaker decided to build a factory on the outskirts of the German capital. Analysts said the Volkswagen committee meeting highlighted the difficulties in reforming a carmaker where labour representatives control half the seats on the board of directors and local politicians have a 20% voting stake, allowing them to vote down significant strategic reform proposals. \"The company has some of the most amazing and most global brands, it has the scale to deploy any technology and the innovation power to be an early mover. What it appears to be lacking is the right corporate governance,\" Bernstein autos analyst Arndt Ellinghorst said in a note late on Monday. \"There should be no illusion, this transformation will always trigger conflicts. Whether there is a new CEO or not, the questions will remain the same, and any VW CEO will need the full backing from VW's largest shareholders, the Porsche families.\" Volkswagen is worth 77.2 billion euros ($92.4 billion), far below rival Toyota's market value of $155.7 billion and Tesla's $555 billion. And that's despite the fact that Volkswagen sold 10.96 million vehicles last year - the most by any carmaker in the world - while Toyota came in second with 10.74 million. Tesla sold only 367,500 cars in the same period. Analysts say that's because Volkswagen is less efficient and has higher costs. Volkswagen Group had 671,205 employees at the end of 2019, compared with 359,542 at Toyota at the end of its fiscal year, and 48,016 at Tesla last year. FORCING THE ISSUE German companies customarily deliberate contract extensions for management board members only a year ahead of expiration. Diess, however, forced the issue after labour leader Bernd Osterloh stifled his reform efforts. These included Diess's attempts to install allies Arno Antlitz as chief financial officer and Thomas Schmall as chief procurement officer on the management board, the three sources told Reuters. Rather than approving each individual appointment, the labour leaders insist on approving a \"package solution\" which is \"harmonious\", two people familiar with the deliberations said. Osterloh is also said to oppose an early contract extension for Diess, one of the three sources said. In a post on LinkedIn this week, Osterloh said there was no fight about management appointments because no committee on the supervisory board had been formally consulted about the issue. Diess, for his part, voiced his frustration in a column in the German daily Handelsblatt published on Friday. \"When I took office in Wolfsburg, I had firmly resolved to change the VW system. This meant breaking up old, encrusted structures and making the company more agile and modern,\" he said. \"Together with many companions with the same level of motivation, I succeeded in doing this in many places, but not in some, especially not yet at our corporate headquarters in Wolfsburg.\" ($1 = 0.8368 euros) (Reporting by Edward Taylor and Jan Schwartz; Editing by Pravin Char and Mark Potter)"

    "article_text":"What Happened: The South Korean battery maker reportedly plans the move to keep up with Tesla\u2019s growth in China, which is the world\u2019s largest car market. LG Chem will supply battery cells from its Chinese and Korean factories to Tesla\u2019s manufacturing sites in the United States and Germany, two people with the knowledge of the matter told Reuters. \u201cTesla simply doesn\u2019t have enough battery cells,\u201d revealed an unnamed person \u2014 adding, \u201cSo LG Chem is going to more than double China output.\u201d LG Chem added production lines to its South Korean factories this year to meet the demand arising from Tesla\u2019s U.S. plants, according to unnamed sources of the newswire. \u201cWe\u2019re continuing to expand capacity for cylindrical battery cells in response to growing demand from automakers but we can\u2019t comment on specific customers,\u201d an LG Chem spokesperson said. Why It Matters: LG Chem\u2019s battery cell business became an independent unit on Tuesday. The company plans to triple the capacity of cylindrical cells to 60-gigawatt hours by 2023, as per Reuters. Strong demand for Tesla\u2019s vehicles is reportedly a positive development for LG Chem, Panasonic, and China\u2019s Contemporary Amperex Technology Co Ltd. LG Chem will invest $500 million over 2020 to raise the production capacity of 21700 cylindrical battery cells used by Tesla by 8 GWh at its Nanjing plant, according to the local government. Reuters sources revealed that LG Chem\u2019s plan involves raising the number of production lines from eight to 17. LG Chem and CATL supply battery cells for Model 3 vehicles, while the Korean manufacturer is the sole supplier for the Shanghai-built Model Y SUVs. Calculations made by Reuters indicate 17 lines at Nanjing would be able to supply 323,000 vehicles a year as each LG Chem line is able to make 7 million cells a month and each model uses 4,416 battery cells. Price Action: Tesla shares closed 3.1% lower at $567.60 on Monday and rose 4.32% in the after-hours session to $592.10.\u00a0 \u00a0 See more from Benzinga \u00a9 2020 Benzinga.com.

    "headline":"Exclusive: LG Chem to double China battery capacity to meet Tesla demand - sources",
    "url":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/exclusive-lg-chem-double-china-052725905.html",
    "article_text":"SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's LG Chem Ltd plans to more than double production capacity of battery cells it makes in China for Tesla Inc electric vehicles (EV) next year, sources said, to keep up with its U.S. client's growth in the biggest car market. The firm, a supplier for Tesla's Shanghai-built Model 3, will also ship its increased output from China as well as Korea to Tesla's factories in Germany and the United States, said two people with knowledge of the matter, signalling an increased role in the supply chain of the world's leading EV manufacturer. The plan comes as Tesla, LG Chem's primary customer, scrambles to secure cells as part of an aggressive global production expansion plan, as it targets soaring demand fanned by governments promoting EVs to curb air pollution. LG Chem has already added production lines in South Korea this year mainly to meet demand from Tesla's U.S. plant, the people said. Moreover, the automaker has asked Japan's Panasonic Corp - which supplies the U.S. plant - to also supply its Shanghai factory, said one of the people, who declined to be identified as the matter was confidential. \"Tesla simply doesn't have enough battery cells,\" said the person. \"So LG Chem is going to more than double China output.\" Tesla's growth represents a boon for LG Chem, Panasonic and Chinese supplier Contemporary Amperex Technology Co Ltd (CATL), with Chief Executive Elon Musk revealing plans in September to increase purchases. Still, Musk said supplies were insufficient and announced Tesla's plans to make its own, cheaper battery cells - a prospect that could injure suppliers' pricing power. \"We're continuing to expand capacity for cylindrical battery cells in response to growing demand from automakers but we can't comment on specific customers,\" an LG Chem spokesman said. LG Chem, whose battery cell business on Tuesday became an independent unit, in October said it would triple capacity of cylindrical cells to 60 gigawatt hours by 2023, without naming Tesla or disclosing other details. Its China plan and Germany and U.S. destinations are reported here for the first time. Tesla was not immediately available for comment. Panasonic declined to comment. MODEL Y LG Chem will invest $500 million over the next year to raise annual production capacity of 21700 cylindrical battery cells - a type used by Tesla - at its Nanjing plant by 8 GWh, the local government said last week, without disclosing current capacity. The two people told Reuters the plan involved increasing the number of production lines to at least 17 from eight. LG Chem, alongside CATL, supplies battery cells for Tesla's Model 3 sedan built in Shanghai, where production began last year and whose current annual capacity is 250,000 cars. Tesla aims to start making its Model Y sport-utility vehicle at the plant next year, for which capacity will reach 250,000 by 2022, Morningstar previously reported. Each model uses 4,416 battery cells, and each LG Chem line is able to produce up to 7 million cells a month, one of the people said. LG Chem's 17 lines in Nanjing would therefore be able to cater for up to 323,000 vehicles a year, a Reuters calculation showed. Initially, LG Chem will be the sole supplier for Shanghai-built Model Y cars, said one of the people. CATL was not immediately available for comment. LG Chem's China factory will also initially supply battery cells for Tesla vehicles in Berlin when production there begins, the person said. The automaker needs permission should it want to make its own cells locally.

    "article_text":"By Arunima Kumar and Noel Randewich (Reuters) - Tesla Inc shares jumped 4% in extended trade on Monday after S&P Dow Jones Indices said it would add one of Wall Street's most valuable companies to the S&P 500 index all at once on Dec. 21. Adding Elon Musk's Tesla to Wall Street's most followed benchmark will force index funds to buy about $73 billion worth of its shares, S&P Dow Jones Indices said. The electric car maker's stock has surged over 40% since Nov. 16, when it was announced Tesla would join the index. At that time, S&P Dow Jones Indices said it would consult investors about whether to potentially add Tesla in two tranches a week apart to make the addition easier to handle for index funds. \"In its decision, S&P DJI considered the wide range of responses it received, as well as, among other factors, the expected liquidity of Tesla and the market\u2019s ability to accommodate significant trading volumes on this date,\" S&P Dow Jones Indices said in a media statement. With a stock market value around $550 billion, Tesla will be among the most valuable companies ever added to the index. Tesla will account for just over 1% of the S&P 500. Up about 600% in 2020, the California-based car maker has become the most valuable auto company in the world, by far, despite production that is a fraction of rivals such as Toyota Motor, Volkswagen and General Motors. A blockbuster quarterly report in July cleared a major hurdle related to profitability that had prevented Tesla's inclusion in the S&P 500. About a fifth of Tesla's shares are closely held by Musk, the chief executive, and other insiders. Since the S&P 500 is weighted by the amount of companies' shares actually available on the stock market, Tesla's influence within the benchmark will be slightly diminished, putting it at around seventh place, currently held by Johnson & Johnson. S&P Dow Jones said it would announce on Dec. 11 which company Tesla would replace in the S&P 500.

    "article_text":"In September, the automakers reach a $2 billion agreement that gave GM an 11% stake in Nikola for supplying battery and fuel cell technologies as well as producing the Badger. But now, GM\u00a0is giving up its equity stake in Nikola, which will also refund order deposits for the Badger. Under the new pact, Nikola and GM will \"work together to integrate GM's Hydrotec fuel-cell technology into Nikola's Class 7 and Class 8 zero-emission semi-trucks for the medium- and long-haul trucking sectors,' the company said in a statement. Nikola expects to begin testing the trucks by the end of 2021-22. In addition, Nikola is in discussions with GM to use GM's Ultium battery system in Nikola's trucks. \"In a nutshell, the signing of GM as a partner is a positive, but ultimately no ownership\/equity stake in Nikola and the billions of R&D potentially now off the table is a major negative blow to the Nikola story,\" wrote Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives in a note Monday. \"This went from a game-changer deal for Nikola to a good supply partnership but nothing to write home about.\" The GM-Nikola deal for a Badger manufacturing partnership initially was expected to close before Sept. 30. But the talks hit a snag with the deadline pushed to this week, after fraud allegations against Nikola and its founder, Trevor Milton. A report from short-seller Hindenburg Research said Milton had misled investors and over-exaggerated the capabilities of the startup's drivetrain and other technologies. Nikola denied the allegations. But Milton resigned as the company's executive chairman on Sept. 21. In addition to the fraud claims, two women have filed sexual assault claims with Utah authorities against Milton. GM now plans to spend $27 billion on electric cars and autonomous vehicles through 2025, up from a prior target of $20 billion. Also by 2025, GM plans to launch 30 electric cars around the world, with two-thirds of them available in the U.S. Previously, it planned at least 20 new models by 2023. The company sped up the development schedules for 12 vehicle programs: the Hummer electric truck, three other GMC Ultium variants that include an EV pickup, four Chevrolet electric vehicles that also includes a pickup and compact crossover, and four Cadillacs. The Lyriq, Cadillac's first all-electric vehicle, which will arrive in Q1 2022, is nine months ahead of its prior schedule. YOU MAY ALSO LIKE:"

    "url":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/tesla-starts-week-3-gain-133430390.html",
    "article_text":"(Bloomberg) -- Tesla Inc. shares were volatile on Monday ahead of a decision by S&P Dow Jones Indices on how it plans to add the electric vehicle company to its benchmark. Tesla\u2019s $554 billion market cap poses a challenge for addition into the index, prompting the S&P to request feedback from the financial community on whether to include the stock all at once on Dec. 21 or break it in over two days -- which would be a first in S&P history. An S&P spokesperson said the decision will be announced at 5:15pm New York time on Monday. The company\u2019s impending entry to the group of 500 companies has led to a buying frenzy in its stock and on those of other upstart electric vehicle makers, leading to a more than 40% jump in the company\u2019s share price just since Nov. 16 when the decision was announced. Tesla shares rose as much as 3.81% to touch a record high of $607.80, and then dropped 5.3%. Currently they are trading down 0.5%. Whichever way it is added, Tesla\u2019s inclusion in the prestigious index will be a big event for money managers. Its current size - Tesla would fit between Berkshire Hathaway Inc. and Facebook Inc., the fifth and sixth biggest index members - means managers of index-tracking funds will have to sell stocks of several other companies to make room for the newcomer in their portfolio, leading to a lot of shuffling. Earlier this month, analysts at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said the move could result in $8 billion of demand from active U.S. large-cap mutual funds. That would represent about 1.5% of Tesla\u2019s current market value. \u201cThe most likely scenario remains two inclusion tranches of 50% each, on Dec. 14 and Dec. 21,\u201d said Gary Black, who was chief executive of Aegon Asset Management from mid 2016 through September, and now holds Tesla as a private investor. Black expects the stock to run up ahead of the first inclusion, and then retreat about 10% to 20%, a pattern he said would be consistent with what happened with Facebook Inc.\u2019s shares after its entry into the S&P 500 Index in Dec. 2013. \u201cBig question is how many shares of Tesla will actually be needed by money managers,\u201d Black said. The investor estimates managers overseeing index-tracking funds of about $5 trillion will require 120 million shares to match up the company\u2019s expected 1.4% index weighting. Tesla currently has about 948 million shares outstanding and a free float of about 758 million. Black is bullish on Tesla and has a $720 price target on the stock over six to 12 months. That would represent a 23% rise from Friday\u2019s close. Tesla on Monday also won Chinese approval to start selling its Shanghai-assembled Model Y SUVs in the country, a development that can further add to the already-high investor optimism. Meanwhile, electric vehicle startup Nikola Corp. suffered a setback on Monday, as General Motors Co. scaled back a partnership with the company, scrapping a tentative deal to jointly build an electric pickup truck and replaced it with a non-binding deal to supply hydrogen-fuel technology.

    "article_text":"Chicago, IL \u2013 November 30, 2020 \u2013 Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include Tesla TSLA, NVIDIA NVDA, Cadence Design Systems CDNS, Flex FLEX and Keysight Technologies KEYS. The resurgence in coronavirus cases is drawing attention to the importance of electric vehicles (EV), and prompting us to reconsider the future of transport by focusing on fully autonomous vehicles and how the same can address safety issues triggered by the crisis. The coronavirus situation is now anticipated to accelerate the adoption of driverless vehicles to carry passengers, transport goods and others. Moreover, demand for fuel efficient and smarter high-performance vehicles compliant with government imposed stringent emission rules necessitate a future of driving dominated by green vehicles. Markedly, improvement in the EV infrastructure, which combines innovation in semiconductors, simulation software, electronics testing equipment and measuring instruments, predictive algorithms, and AI, is enabling automakers to bring EVs mainstream sooner than anticipated. The rapid developments can primarily be attributed to breakthroughs in technology with the integration of robust AI and ML capabilities in the advanced driver-assistance system (ADAS). The automotive industry bigwigs are making every effort to enhance the safety of passengers and drivers in EVs and self-driving cars, and foot-travelers in transit. Thereby, advanced testing methodologies are in huge demand as automakers and tech companies seek to deliver advanced automotive systems. Ongoing momentum of mobility-as-a-service (MaaS) solutions and the accelerated deployment of 5G are anticipated to be tailwinds. Despite the coronavirus pandemic-led crisis, the optimism in this space is evident from the notable performance of Global X Autonomous & Electric Vehicles ETF (DRIV), which has rallied 48.8% year to date compared with the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust SPY\u2019s growth of 12.7%. Moreover, recent growing market interest in EVs is noteworthy with Tesla up 586% on a year-to-date basis. Per Allied Market Research data, the global EV market is projected to hit $802.81 billion by 2027, from $162.34 billion in 2019, at a CAGR of 22.6%. This brings our focus to four technology stocks that are well positioned to gain from the current scenario: NVIDIA\u00a0is partnering with automotive companies to drive innovation in simulation software, automotive sensors, cameras and LiDars to facilitate driverless transport. The company is working with more than 320 automakers, tier-one suppliers, automotive research institutions, HD mapping companies and start-ups to develop and deploy AI systems for self-driving vehicles. The Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company\u2019s launch of Drive AGX Orin deserves a special mention. It is a highly advanced software-defined platform for autonomous vehicles and robots powered by a new system-on-a-chip (SoC) called Orin that consists of 17 billion transistors. It was recently selected by Li Auto, in a bid to accelerate the development of its next generation of EVs. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. The company expects its automotive TAM to be $30 billion by 2025, which comprises $25 billion for driving, $3 billion for training\/development of deep neural networks and $2 billion for validation and testing. Higher sales of AI (artificial intelligence) cockpit solutions and traction witnessed by automotive platforms for infotainment systems position the company well to capitalize on the EV boom. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2021 earnings has been revised upward by 5.8% in the past 30 days to $9.66 per share. Cadence Design Systems\u00a0continues to invest heavily in verification and digital design products, which is helping it to launch products that address the ever-growing needs of semiconductor companies involved in making chips for ADAS. Further, Cadence\u2019s Advanced Packaging solutions continue to witness incremental adoption in hyperscale and automotive verticals. Markedly, the company\u2019s Allegro technology was implemented by a well-known auto maker for wafer level system packaging requirements in third-quarter 2020. Cadence has recently introduced System-Level Verification IP (System VIP) solution. The latest set of offerings provide improved chip-level verification efficiency for customers who are engaged in production of automotive, hyperscale, mobile and consumer chips. This Zacks Rank #2 company has also won orders from well-known companies like Intel\u2019s MobilEye and Infineon, which are developing ADAS related technologies. The consensus mark for 2020 earnings has been revised upward by 5.9% in the past 60 days to $2.70 per share. Investors, looking to invest in mid-cap stocks, can count on Flex, which is gaining from recovery in the automotive sector. The company is expanding its business in the automotive sector especially in the field of autonomous cars and electrification. This Zacks Rank #2 player has also inked an alliance with Leddar Tech to work on LiDAR sensors. Markedly, Leddar Tech is well-known sensing solutions\u2019 developer for ADAS and autonomous vehicles. For third-quarter fiscal 2021, Flex Reliability Solutions\u2019 is projected to report revenue growth of low to mid-single digits, sequentially, based on a recovering automotive sector and continued strength in the industrial end-market such as power products. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2021 earnings has been revised upward by 11.5% in the past 30 days to $1.26 per share. Keysight Technologies\u00a0is gaining from increasing investment in advanced automotive technology, which led to double-digit growth in orders in fourth-quarter fiscal 2020 in a sequential basis across all regions. The company is witnessing uptick in ScienLab EV test solutions in Asia and Europe on government mandate-led electrification of vehicles. In a bid to capitalize on growing investments, the company rolled out a new radar target simulator for ADAS, and another solution for testing Automotive Ethernet standards compliance for in-vehicle networks. The company has also announced collaborations with SGS and Qualcomm to advance testing of Cellular Vehicle-to-Everything, or C-V2X, technology. Additionally, improving supply chain management and uptick in 5G chip design solutions on accelerated 5G deployment boosts the company\u2019s business prospects. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2021 earnings has been revised upward by 3.9% in the past 30 days to $5.56 per share. Keysight currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana. Ignited by referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $17.7 billion in 2019 to a staggering $73.6 billion by 2027.

    "article_text":"The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down more than 300 points midday Monday, after closing above the 30,000 level for the first time ever last week. Yet the three major indexes are poised to wrap up November with big gains north of 10% each. It's been a volatile few months. On Sept. 30, the IBD stock market outlook was upgraded to \"confirmed uptrend\" from \"market in correction.\" But on Oct. 23, the outlook was downgraded to \"uptrend under pressure\" as stocks sold off. On Nov. 4, after Election Day, the\u00a0market outlook\u00a0returned to \"confirmed uptrend\" as the\u00a0major indexes staged big rallies. That gives the green light to buy leading stocks that are\u00a0breaking out of solid bases. Automakers, energy and retail stocks led the downside among IBD's 197 industry groups. Database software and dairy products makers were some of the few advancing groups. In September, the automakers struck a $2 billion deal that gave GM an 11% stake in Nikola for supplying battery and fuel cell technologies as well as producing the Badger. But now, GM\u00a0is giving up its equity stake in Nikola, which will also refund order deposits for the Badger. YOU MAY ALSO LIKE:"

    "headline":"Tesla Stock: How To Trade A Broken Wing Butterfly",
    "url":"https:\/\/www.investors.com\/research\/options\/tesla-stock-how-to-trade-a-broken-wing-butterfly\/?src=A00220",
    "article_text":"Tesla stock has been on fire lately, rallying from 400 to 585 since being added to the S&P 500. While it would take a brave person to bet against Tesla stock, today I want to look at an option trade idea that will profit if Tesla consolidates around this level. The trade can also make money if Tesla stock rallies a little bit, but not too much. A broken wing butterfly using calls is a trade that can be set up with zero risk on the downside and a nice profit zone on the upside. The catch is that there is risk on upside if Tesla stock makes a big move higher. So, this is a neutral to slightly bullish trade. Very bullish traders would not enter this trade. Let's take a look at how a broken wing butterfly trade might be set up on Tesla stock: Notice that the lower strike call is 20 points away from the middle call and the upper call is 40 points away. This broken wing butterfly trade will generate $220 in premium. There is no loss potential on the downside, the worst that can happen is all the calls expire worthless and the trader gets to keep the $220 premium. On the upside, the maximum loss can be calculated by taking the width between the first two strikes (20) multiplied by 100 and subtracting the premium received (220). That gives us 20 x 100 \u2014 220 = $1,780 The maximum gain can be calculated as 20 x 100 + 220 = $2,220 although it's unlikely this amount would ever be achieved. The ideal scenario for the trade is that Tesla stock stays below 700 until expiration. For those with a neutral to slightly bullish outlook, a broken wing butterfly could be a nice way to trade Tesla stock. In terms of risk management, I would set a stop loss of 15%, or around $265. It's important to remember that options are risky and investors can lose 100% of their investment. This article is for education purposes only and not a trade recommendation.

    "article_text":"The Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled more than 400 points amid Moderna coronavirus vaccine news midday Monday, as Tesla stock raced to another all-time high before briefly reversing sharply lower. Nikola plunged as much as 27% after announcing a new, more limited deal with General Motors. On Monday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.3%, while the S&P 500 lost 0.9%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite slid 0.65% in midday trade. Moderna stock surged 17% in morning trade. Amid the coronavirus stock market rally, the tech-heavy Nasdaq is up 36.0% for the year through Friday's close. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 is up 12.6%, while the DJIA is up 4.8% year to date, through the Nov. 27 close. The cumulative total of worldwide Covid-19 cases confirmed since the start of the outbreak topped 63.1 million Monday, with more than 1.46 million virus-related deaths. Investors should continue to use the stock market's strength to buy breakouts. Start slowly with new purchases and see how they perform. If they work, then add more exposure. But if breakouts start to fail, then you can back away. The top payment processor retailer is the No. 10-performing stock on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, advancing 12.3% year to date. Chipotle Mexican Grill is approaching a 1,346.10 buy point in a double bottom with handle Monday. Shares lost over 1.5% in morning trade. On Nov. 18, shares broke out above a 466 buy point in an awkward cup with handle and are already nearly 30% from the buy point. On Monday, Tesla stock set a record high at 607.80 Monday morning. The new deal replaces the transaction announced on Sept. 8, 2020 and does not include a GM equity stake in Nikola. Nikola stock plunged 27% in morning trade, adding to Friday's 7.6% decline. Shares are more than 75% off their 52-week high. Apple stock continues to trace a new base with a 138.08 buy point. An early entry exists at 125.49. But the top Dow Jones stock is starting to show signs of significant weakness with a lagging relative strength line. The blue-chip giant is the No. 1-performing Dow Jones stock for 2020, with a 58.8% advance through Friday. Software giant Microsoft moved down 1.6% Monday. Shares are testing the 50-day support level. Year to date, Microsoft is one of the top Dow Jones stocks, advancing 36.5% through the Nov. 27 close. YOU MAY ALSO LIKE:"

    "url":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/teslas-256-since-appeared-top-145717814.html",
    "article_text":"Our system is still bullish on Tesla. Our analysis of total returns and options market sentiment put Tesla in the top ten again on Wednesday. It was the only name from the May 28th top names cohort to appear in the November 25th cohort. Others, however, have suggested Tesla's valuation may have gotten ahead of itself.\u00a0 Bloomberg's Joe Wiesenthal noted that Elon Musk is now richer than Bill Gates.\u00a0 Wiesenthal also suggested that Tesla's spike was a bubble driven by desperate speculators.\u00a0 Maybe It's Worth Hedging Here Even if you're bullish on Tesla, it might make sense to hedge here, in the event the stock corrects in the near term (as it did earlier this year). Here's one way to do that.\u00a0 Crash Protection For Tesla I tried hedging 100 shares of Tesla against a greater-than-20% decline over the next several months two ways: ones with optimal puts (uncapped upside) and once with an optimal collar (capped upside). Uncapped Upside - Unavailable On Wednesday, if you scanned for an optimal put to hedge Tesla against a >20% drop over the next 6 months, you would have gotten this error message. What \"net cost exceeds threshold\" means is that the cost of hedging against a >20% decline was more than 20% of your position value. So, by buying that hedge, you would have incurred more than the loss you were looking to prevent. Capped Upside, Negative Cost If you were willing to cap your possible upside in Tesla at 38% over the next six months, this was the optimal collar to protect against a >20% decline over the same time frame. Here the net cost was negative, meaning you would have collected a net credit of $425, or 0.74% of position value, when opening this hedge, assuming, conservatively, that you bought the puts and sold the calls at the worst ends of their respective spreads. That worked out to an annualized cost as a percentage of position value of -1.32%. When Tesla Pulls Back If Tesla pulls back within the next few months, you'll be able to buy-to-close the call leg on the collar above for a lot less than you got for selling it, and you'll be able to sell the puts for a lot more. If you're still bullish on Tesla then, you sell those appreciated puts to buy more shares. See more from Benzinga \u00a9 2020 Benzinga.com. Benzinga does not provide investment advice.

    "article_text":"Electric vehicles (EV) with zero emissions are the hottest trend in the auto industry. Amid heightening climate concerns, Germany has been doubling down on its efforts toward e-mobility. Auto companies of the country are under immense pressure to switch to clean mobility. This would require large sums of investment, which will be particularly difficult at a time when the firms are dealing with coronavirus-led sluggish vehicle demand. Amid the craze for red-hot EV maker Tesla TSLA and the increasing popularity of green vehicles, several automakers worldwide are revising their electric goals. Early this month, there were reports that the German government would offer a \u20ac2 billion stimulus to the nation\u2019s automotive industry in a bid to bolster the transition toward green vehicles. In addition to e-mobility and driverless technology, the funds will be allocated toward 3D printing parts, digitization of supply chains, and employee training between 2021 and 2024. The program would see the government covering nearly 60% of the transition costs for large companies and 80% for small to medium ones, in their efforts toward making the production facilities more environment-friendly. Germany is providing incentives to buyers of battery-powered EVs until the end of next year. Buyers of fully-electric cars with a price ceiling of \u20ac40,000 will be eligible for a grant of \u20ac9,000, one third of which will be funded by carmakers. Buyers of plug-in hybrids costing up to 40,000 euros will also get higher subsidies with 4,500 euros from the government and 2,250 euros from automakers. From 2022 onward, incentives would be reduced for the plug-in-hybrids but all electric cars will continue to get government support via grants till 2025. Germany also aims at fostering the creation of EV charging stations in as many locales as possible.\u00a0Every gas station in the country needs to install EV charging stations.\u00a0As part of Germany\u2019s chancellor\u00a0Angela Merkel\u2019s Climate Protection Program 2030, Germany aims to put 10 million electric cars on the nation\u2019s roads by 2030. Merkel has also set a goal of having\u00a0a million electric charging stations\u00a0across the country by 2030. Major German auto bigwigs like Volkswagen VWAGY, Daimler AG DDAIF and BMW AG BAMXF are focusing on radically electrifying their line-ups.\u00a0While BMW currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Volkswagen and Daimler carry Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see\u00a0the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. Volkswagen: Volkswagenremains committed toinvesting 33 billion euros in e-mobility by 2024. It also intends to spend around 14 billion euros in technology and autonomous driving. The plans are in sync with the firm\u2019s objective to go carbon neutral by 2050.The firm aims 40% of its global car sales to be fully electric by 2030.The deal between Volkswagen and Electrify America also highlights the automaker\u2019s aggressive stance with regard to the EV race.\u00a0 Scheduled for a global debut during the first quarter of 2021, Volkswagen\u2019s ID.4 electric SUV is based on the modular MEB platform.\u00a0The MEB platform, which supports the ID 3 and ID 4, will also provide the platform of the ID.5 coup\u00e9-SUV, ID.6 and ID Buzz. The company is set to develop a small electric car for the mass market in Europe. Under this project, Volkswagen anticipates to develop a 100% electric car, which is anticipated to be cheaper than ID.3 and will be available between 20,000euros and 25,000 euros ($24,000-30,000). Notably, Volkswagen plans to invest 15 billion euros by 2024-end to increase electrification efforts in China. The auto biggie aims to develop 15 new electric or hybrid models in China by 2025.The EVs will be based on the MEB architecture\u00a0at its two new dedicated modular electric drive matrix manufacturing facilities in China. The company has been collaborating with local battery suppliers in China to meet its future requirements. BMW: BMW is committed to selling more than 7 million EVs \u2014 comprising both hybrids and fully electric cars \u2014 by the end of next decade. The automaker targets two-thirds of the sales to come from fully electric vehicles. The company has pledged to invest around \u20ac30 billion toward e-mobility by 2025 end. By 2025, BMW is set to introduce nine new electric car models including iX3, i4 and iNEXT.The BMW i4and BMW iNEXT, which is an all-electric crossover, will come on the market in 2021, while the BMW iX3, an all-electric SUV, is due to go on sale before 2020 end. The BMW Concept i4 is claimed to be capable of running up to 600 km on a single charge. With a 150kW charger, the i4's battery can be charged to 80% in 35 minutes.\u00a0BMW iX3 will rely on a 74-kWh battery pack, which will enable it to travel up to 273 miles (440 kilometers), on a single charge. BMW iNext is expected to include hardware that could take the iNext to Level 3 autonomy at up to 80 MPH. Daimler: Daimler\u2014 Mercedes Benz\u2019s parent company\u2014 targets a carbon neutral new-vehicle fleet by 2039. The company desires its electrified portfolio\u2019s share to be 50% of its global sales by 2030. To keep up in the race to EV supremacy, Mercedes-Benz has decided to reorient its model lineup, inclining the fleet toward electric vehicles. The German automaker unveiled plans of producing bigger all-electric models first, eventually moving into its special divisions \u2014 AMG brand, its ultra-luxury Mercedes-Maybach brand and the G models. By 2025, the company will start adding smaller EVs to the lineup.\u00a0The company also revealed the four all-new EVs that will be developed on its upcoming platform \u2014Electric Vehicle Architecture (EVA). The first vehicle will be its fully-electric sedan called the EQS, set to debut next year that will be built on the company\u2019s new modular electric vehicle platform. The EQS will be an all-electric, S-Class-like luxury sedan. Following that will be the EQE, EQS-SUV and EQE-SUV. In sync with its electrification goals, Daimler Trucks aims to offer EVs in all its key sales region by 2022. Series production of the eCascadia and the Freightliner eM2 is slated to begin mid-2022 and in late 2022, respectively. Production of the eActros and eEconic is scheduled to commence in 2021 and 2022, respectively. Last year, it generated $24 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $77.6 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce \"the world's first trillionaires,\" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.

Affected vehicles include some of the best-selling models of General Motors \u2014 including Cadillac Escalade SUVs, GMC Sierra and Chevrolet Silverado pickups, GMC Yukon and Yukon XL SUVs, Chevrolet Tahoe and Suburban SUVs \u2014 manufactured between 2007 and 2014. In a separate development, General Motors\u00a0is pulling out of Trump\u2019s lawsuit against California over fuel economy standards. The company has also urged other automakers including Toyota and Fiat Chrysler to back out from Trump\u2019s legal attack on California\u2019s clean vehicles program.General Motors is working toward EV revolution and agrees with Biden\u2019s plan to rev up e-mobility development. Tesla has filed a safety recall for more than 9500 Model X and Y SUVs in the United States with the NHTSA due to manufacturing defects.Reportedly, the company has recalled 9,136 Model X SUVs built in 2015 and 2016 over chunks of the body that could get disconnected while driving due to the absence of primer and 437 Model Y SUVs over a possibly loose bolt that could cause separation of the upper control arm from the steering knuckle. Meanwhile, Tesla\u00a0signed a contract with LG Chem, per which the latter will exclusively supply rechargeable batteries for the Made-in-China Model Y Dual-Motor Long Range and Performance variants.\u00a0Earlier, it was speculated that the red-hot EV maker would pick China\u2019s top battery supplier CATL or Japan\u2019s Panasonic for supplying batteries for Model Y. However, with the latest contract, Tesla has ruled out both companies for supplying batteries for the Model Y. The following table shows the price movement of some of the major auto players over the past week and six-month period. In the past six months, all stocks have increased apart from AutoZone. Over the past week, all stocks gained apart from Toyota TM and Honda HMC. Notably, Tesla registered the maximum gains during both the said periods. Car enthusiasts will be keeping a close watch on November 2020 U.S. car sales, which will be coming out later this week. Investors in the auto sector would be closely tracking the monthly sales reports of auto biggies like Honda, Hyundai, Toyota Motor and Ford F among many others. Investors will keenly wait for updates on the long-pending deal between Nikola NKLA and General Motors. The companies have until Dec 3 to close the deal.\u00a0 Last year, it generated $24 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $77.6 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce \"the world's first trillionaires,\" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.

Other Japanese auto makers\u2019 goals look further down the road. Honda Motor (HMC) wants to electrify two-thirds of its global auto sales by 2030. That includes hybrid, plug-in hybrids, and BEV.  Toyota Motor (TM), of course, is a leader in hybrid with the Prius. In June 2020, the company said it wants to sell more than 5.5 million electrified vehicles\u2014including more than 1 million zero-emission vehicles\u2014by 2030.  Zero-emission vehicles include fuel-cell vehicles, too. Honda sells a fuel-cell vehicle\u2014the Clarity\u2014already.  Volkswagen (VOW.Germany) is planning to spend about $85 billion over the next five years on vehicle electrification and digital technologies.  Almost half of that will be on battery electric vehicles. By 2029, VW plans to have brought 75 fully electric models and 60 hybrid models to the market.  The company wants to have 20% to 25% of total sales form BEV by 2030.  Kia Motors (000270.Korea) wants BEVs to account for 25% of global vehicle sales by 2029. That was the company\u2019s goal as recently as September.  Kia also has a strong BEV presence today, selling more than 100,000 BEVs worldwide since the introduction of the Kia Ray in 2011.  China is the world\u2019s largest car market and the largest market for EVs.  Global electric-vehicle sales have hit about 3% of total auto sales year to date. EV statistics typically include hybrid, plug-in hybrid, as well as all-electric models. The EV industry is still small today, but it looks like it will be a lot bigger by 2025. "

As Google explains, smaller companies often handle customer data on mobile devices, but many of today's remote device management solutions are too complex for small business owners, and are often complicated to get up-and-running. Android Enterprise Essentials attempts to make the overall setup process easier by eliminating the need to manually activate each device.

    "url":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/yc-backed-buildbuddy-raises-3-140008602.html",
    "article_text":"BuildBuddy\u2019s funding round makes it clear that choppy market conditions and a move away from in-person demos did not fully dampen investor interest in YC\u2019s March batch of startups, though it\u2019s far too soon to tell if the group will perform as well as others, given how long it takes for startup winners to mature into exits. During that time he became accustomed to building software in the Google style, namely using its internal tool called Blaze to compile his code. It\u2019s core to how developers at Google work, Simonarson told TechCrunch. \"You write some code,\" he added, \"you run Blaze build; you write some code, you run Blaze test.\" What sets Blaze apart from other developer tools is that \u201copposed to your traditional language-specific build tools,\u201d Simonarson said, it\u2019s code agnostic, so you can use it to \u201cbuild across [any] programming language.\u201d So what does BuildBuddy do? In product terms, it\u2019s building the pieces of Blaze that Google engineers have access to inside the company, for other developers using Bazel in their own work. In business terms, BuildBuddy wants to offer its service to individual developers for free, and charge companies that use its product. This origin story underlines something that BuildBuddy has that early-stage startups often lack, namely demonstrable enterprise market appetite. Lots of big companies use Bazel to help create software, and BuildBuddy found its way into a few of them early in its life. Simply building a useful tool for a popular open-source project is no guarantee of success, however. Happily for BuildBuddy, early users helped it set direction for its product development, meaning that over the summer the startup added the features that its current users most wanted.  Simonarson explained that after BuildBuddy was initially used by external developers, they demanded additional tools, like authentication. In the words of the co-founder, the response from the startup was \u201cgreat!\u201d The same went for a request for dashboarding, and other features. Even better for the YC graduate, some of the features requested were the sort that it intends to charge for. That brings us back to money and the round itself. BuildBuddy closed its round in May. But like with most venture capital tales, it's not a simple story. According to Simonarson, his startup started raising the round during one of those awful early-COVID days when the stock market dropped by double-digit percentage points in a single trading session.  BuildBuddy's goal was to raise $1.5 million. Simonarson was worried at the time, telling TechCrunch that it was his first time fundraising, and that he wasn't sure if his startup was going to \"raise anything at all\" in that climate.  But the nascent company secured its first $100,000 check. And then a $300,000 check, over time managing to fill out its round. So what happened that got the company from $1.5 million to just over $3 million? The investor that put in $300,000 wanted to put in another $2 million. The company talked them down to $1.5 million at a higher cap (BuildBuddy raised its round using a SAFE), and the deal was done at those terms. The startup initially didn't want to raise the extra cash, but Simonarson told TechCrunch that at the time it was not clear where the fundraising environment was heading; BuildBuddy raised back when startup layoffs were a leading story, and a return to high-cadence VC rounds was months away.  So BuildBuddy wound up securing $3.15 million to support a current headcount of four. It intends to hire, naturally, lower its comically long runway and keep building out its Bazel-focused service."

    "article_text":"COVID-19 has changed the way we do our shopping. More people are shopping for more things online instead of going into stores, accelerating the shift to e-commerce. And these changes seem fairly permanent, as the pandemic has brought in new customers and opened new retail verticals for online shopping. With more shopping happening online, marketers are quickly following consumers. That's good for both Google and Amazon.\u00a0 Image source: Amazon. But considering the high purchase intent of Amazon searches, the influx of digital advertising in categories like consumer packaged goods or electronics heavily favors the retailer instead of the general search engine. Amazon has been eating into Google's share of product searches for years. And those searches are some of its most valuable. With Amazon seeing an influx of spending on its marketplace and growth in Prime memberships during the pandemic, investors should expect its share of product searches to have followed suit. And with more searches, there are more opportunities to sell ads. The growth of Amazon's advertising business has supported strong operating margin expansion and ought to continue to support Amazon's bottom line as consumer packaged good ad spending keeps shifting online. But Google is under investigation of antitrust practices in its dealings with Apple. What's more, Apple is reportedly developing its own search engine, which could compete with Google. If Google's forced to relinquish its hold on Safari's default search engine in one way or another, it's not like Google's share of search traffic goes to zero on the iPhone. Google still has many popular services on the iPhone despite competing default services from Apple. Google currently dominates mobile search, thanks in part to its partnership with Apple. If that relationship changes for any reason, it could put a damper on Google's ability to take the majority of search ad growth on mobile as it has in the past. It's worth reiterating the accelerating shift to e-commerce will benefit Google at least some, even if it's not as much as it benefits Amazon. Furthermore, Google and other digital advertisers will see benefits from accelerations in cord-cutting, leading to more marketers seeking digital advertising. In fact, eMarketer now expects search advertising to grow faster long-term than it forecast pre-pandemic. Google still has a lot of growth ahead, but it has a few hurdles in its way. Meanwhile, Amazon's runway is clear for accelerating advertising revenue."

    "article_text":"The Covid-19 pandemic has hit the travel industry hard, including online travel agencies, or OTAs. Yet these were already facing headwinds going into the crisis, argues Bernstein, meaning that investors should proceed with caution.  Analyst Richard Clarke initiated coverage of OTAs with a cautious long-term view on Tuesday.  The fact that \u201cwe, lodging analysts rather than internet analysts, are covering the OTAs is in itself telling,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThese are no longer 30%+ growth disrupters, but established parts of the travel landscape, in even competition with their underlying product and themselves being disrupted by tech intrusion, notably from Google (GOOGL).\u201d Revenue from hotels was 23% in the decade ended 2019, but is set to slow to the mid-single digits post-pandemic, Clarke says, with branded hotels wrestling back control of their distribution. Other travel-related experiences, from home rentals to flight packages often carry lower margins, and while selling experiences\u2014from group tours to wine tastings\u2014may be most promising in terms of profit, Tripadvisor is so far the only company heavily invested in this market.  That is part of the reason that Tripadvisor is his only Outperform-rated stock of the group, with a $35 price target. He initiated coverage of Booking with an Underperform rating, with a price target of $1,720, and Expedia at Market Perform, with a $113 target. With the shares of all three having recovered from their lows, Clarke warns that the stocks are \u201ccurrently being valued on past glories not future realities ...with only Tripadvisor offering any reopening upside.\u201d  While Booking (formerly Priceline) has historically been the strongest performer of the group, he warns that its heavy exposure to lodging means that it will likely suffer the most.  Expedia is facing the same headwinds, but it can offset this to a degree with its business-to-business flight revenues and cost savings.  Booking was up 1.7%, to $2,062.66 in trading Tuesday, and has gained 0.4% year to date; Expedia was 1.2% higher, at $125.98 with a 16.5% rise in 2020; Tripadvisor was up 5%, to $27.40 and is down nearly 10% year to date.

    "article_text":"Anaplan's third-quarter revenue increased 28% year over year to $115 million. This figure topped management's outlook from a few months ago for revenue to be as much as $110 million. Customers and prospective customers are still being affected by the pandemic, but Anaplan continues to make progress getting itself back to pre-crisis growth rates. Revenue increased 45% last year, its first full year as a public company after a late-2018 IPO.  Within the quarterly total, subscription revenue to the company's cloud-based ERP software, which an organization uses to plan everything from finances to inventory management to a marketing campaign, grew 31% from a year ago and made up over 91% of total sales. CEO Frank Calderoni said that some 60% of new bookings came from existing customers, reflecting the challenging environment for large organizations trying to free up enough budget to execute on their digital transformation.  It looks like those companies that have already embarked on their new digital journey remain in the best position to engage with Anaplan. But new deal activity is still unthawing after the freeze in the spring during the worst of the economic lockdowns. Calderoni said customers paying Anaplan at least $250,000 a year increased to 417, a 29% increase from a year ago. Image source: Getty Images. In total, Anaplan had over 1,500 customers at the end of Q3. This is still a small firm that competes in a large ERP software space worth tens of billions in global spending every year, with tech giants like Oracle, SAP, and Workday dominating the space. The market could be seeing better times soon as COVID-19 vaccines and treatments could lead to gradual normalization of the economy.  In spite of current challenges, Anaplan is making progress and setting itself up for years of growth in a post-pandemic world. Calderoni and his team said they talk to many executives a week, and end-to-end operational changes to adapt to the new digital era are top of mind for these executives. Anaplan figures to be part of those changes -- both current and future. Its software helps connect data throughout an organization to help planning teams make better decisions and predictions and untether them from reliance on past results in lieu of more timely cloud-based information. It hasn't been only existing customers propelling Anaplan's recent acceleration in growth, though. The company said one of the top 50 largest companies in the U.S. recently tapped Anaplan's ERP software to manage a more than 10,000-member salesforce, with everything from new-hire onboarding to sales forecasting getting plugged into the planning software. A healthcare distribution company with over $15 billion in annual revenue also signed up to update its processes for the new digital era. Besides replacing some of its legacy ERP rivals, Anaplan said some of these new deals are retiring decades-old software developed by IT teams in-house. \u00a0 However, as it focuses on serving large organizations, Anaplan's rebound is still tied to a greater economic recovery. Management had positive news on that front, though. Fourth-quarter revenue is forecast to be as much as 22% higher than last year, but preliminary fiscal 2022 guidance (for the 12 months ended Jan. 31, 2022) was also provided. At $550 million in sales, it implies a nearly 24% increase over this year's forecast results. Again, this is a preliminary estimate for next year subject to change, but it certainly looks like Calderoni and team are upbeat as progress on a vaccine is being made.  With a market cap currently at $9.5 billion, Anaplan stock trades for 21 times current-year expected sales and 17 times the preliminary forecast for next year. Given management's expected growth, shares look like a fair value to me. And if a vaccine means more economic normalization, I think Anaplan's actual results could be even better than projected. The company's balance sheet shows $297 million in cash and equivalents and no debt, a respectable war chest for the company to continue executing on its growth strategy. I remain optimistic on this cloud software vendor's prospects."

    "article_text":"Airbnb plans to raise $2.5 billion with an initial public offering that will price shares in the range of $44 to $50, according to an updated filing on Tuesday. The Airbnb IPO could occur in mid-December. Airbnb was previously valued at $18 billion earlier this year after raising $2 billion in debt to manage through the early months of the pandemic. DoorDash, the leading food delivery app provider, plans to raise about $2.8 billion, offering 33 million shares at a range of $75 to $85 each. That gives it a valuation of up to $32 billion on a fully diluted basis. It will list on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker DASH. The Airbnb IPO will list on the Nasdaq under the ticker ABNB. During the nine months ended Sept. 30, the gross bookings value at Airbnb plunged 39% to $18 billion, as revenue fell 32% to $2.5 billion, with a net loss of $696.9 million. It has incurred net losses each year since its inception, though it did turn a profit in the recently ended third quarter, as it has three other times since the first quarter of 2018. Third-quarter revenue fell $18% to $1.34 billion, with a profit of $219.3 million. That compares to a loss of $575.6 million in the year-ago period.

    "article_text":"(Bloomberg) -- An Ohio startup that helps hospitals automate routine tasks is now valued at $1.5 billion after a funding round led by Tiger Global Management. Olive AI Inc. received an investment of $225.5 million in the round, which included new investors Alphabet Inc.\u2019s GV, Sequoia Capital, Dragoneer Investment Group and Transformation Partners. Existing investors General Catalyst and Drive Capital also joined the round. Columbus-based Olive has now raised about $385 million in financing in the past nine months and roughly $450 million since its inception in 2012. The company\u2019s software is used by more than 600 hospitals in the U.S. to analyze data for insurance claims and supply chains. Chief Executive Officer Sean Lane said Olive\u2019s customers are using its software to save money in a year in which the health-care business has struggled because of the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cWe\u2019re part of their recovery plan from a cost-savings perspective,\u201d Lane said. The startup is part of Ohio\u2019s growing technology ecosystem. Auto insurance platform Root Inc., also based in Columbus, raised $724 million in an initial public offering in October. Lane said that he believes that launching in Ohio gave the company an advantage because there was less competition for hiring the best local talent. He said Olive has now expanded beyond the state and has a distributed workforce, something that will continue after the pandemic. The newly raised capital will be used for more hiring, as well as product development, he said. Olive will eventually hold an IPO, Lane said. \u201cThe inevitable future is going public.\u201d (Corrects the amount raised by the company in the second paragraph) \u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P."

The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Amazon, Alphabet and Zoom Video. These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today. You can see\u00a0all of today\u2019s research reports here >>> Amazon\u00a0was a standout performer even before the pandemic, but the stock has really thrived in the Covid-19 driven locked down environment that significantly accelerated the shift to digital sales. The stock's +70% gain in the year-to-date period aptly describes this backdrop. Additionally, solid Prime momentum owing to ultrafast delivery services and expanding content portfolio remained tailwind. Further, strengthening AWS services and its growing adoption rate contributed well. However, accelerating coronavirus related expenses remain major concerns. Also, foreign exchange headwinds and rising cloud competition are risks. (You can\u00a0read the full research report on Amazon here >>>) Alphabet\u00a0shares have gained +38.7% over the past one-year period vs. +13% gain for the S&P 500 index, reflecting continued momentum search, cloud and YouTube businesses. The company\u2019s strengthening cloud unit aided substantial revenue growth. Moreover, expanding data centers will continue to bolster its presence in the cloud space. Further, major updates in the search segment are enhancing the search results, which is a major positive. However, the company\u2019s growing litigation issues and increasing expenses might hurt profitability. (You can\u00a0read the full research report on Alphabet here >>>) Zoom Video\u00a0shares have outperformed the Zacks Internet - Software industry in the year-to-date period (+593.1% vs. +100.3%). The Zacks analyst believes that demand for the company\u2019s cloud-native video-first platform is expected to remain solid owing to the work-from-home and online-learning wave. Easy to deploy, use, manage and scalability makes Zoom Video\u2019s software popular among its customers. Expanding clientele is expected to drive top-line growth momentum in the near term. Moreover, the company\u2019s expanding international presence is a key catalyst. However, acute competition from the likes of Microsoft and Cisco in the video-communication space does not bode well. (You can\u00a0read the full research report on Zoom Video here >>>) Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Automatic Data Processing and Moderna. Last year, it generated $24 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $77.6 billion.

    "article_text":"As a cloud data platform, Snowflake leverages the elasticity and performance of the public cloud to enable customers to unify and query big data. Its cloud-native architecture offers three major service layers: Essentially, Snowflake customers feed massive sets of raw data into the cloud and receive back analytics-ready data, useful for distilling business insights and delivering revenue-generating services. With a highly scalable model that allows customers to pay per use, the company has proven exceedingly popular as more and more businesses turn to cloud-based warehousing solutions. Image source: Snowflake. In one year alone, Snowflake has more than doubled its number of customers, with existing customers increasing their usage significantly over time. Consequently, the company's revenue has increased rapidly, growing 121% year over year by the second quarter of fiscal year 2021. On a yearly basis, Snowflake experienced a 174% increase in revenue from fiscal year 2019 to 2020. And all of this is attributable to its competitive advantages. Despite this, Snowflake has a growing number of customers. Why? The company takes innovation and customer needs very seriously, consistently adjusting its offerings to accommodate where its competitors currently do not. Snowflake's competitive offerings include integration of diverse data types, massive scalability without sacrificing performance, simultaneous use cases and users, and extreme ease of use.\u00a0 Image source: Getty Images. Indeed, possibly its greatest competitive advantage comes from its easy-to-use platform and cloud-based architecture. Just as Shopify attracts businesses for its turn-key solutions, Snowflake's made-for-the-cloud platform entices businesses with its scalable, high-performance data-warehousing solution. However, as a company that runs on its competitors' public clouds, Snowflake exposes itself to some unique risks. Any outages or security issues will affect Snowflake as well. Furthermore, the company is extremely young, with a limited operating history, and therefore has very little data on which to forecast its future viability. It has also posted deepening operating losses, as the company experiences the costly growth spurt so typical of today's high-value tech stocks. Given this, from fiscal year 2019 to 2020, Snowflake has delivered net losses of $348 million, even though it boasts a gross profit margin of 61%. "

The FAANG stocks are one of the biggest gainers this year due to the benefits of stay-at-home. As the market keeps an eye on the COVID-19 vaccine developments, it rotates out of the stay-at-home stocks into the cyclical stocks that would benefit from the economy's reopening. \"There are some stocks that become a lot less attractive when the world goes back to normal, but not FAANG,\" Cramer said. He called FAANG stocks in-charge of their destinies, unfazed from the economic downturn. White House leadership or the vaccine timeline does not affect these companies as they are not cyclical. Facebook:\u00a0The management has changed its narrative from a profit-seeking company to a product-based company helping small and medium-sized businesses affected by the pandemic. Cramer said that many executives had told him that advertising on Facebook gives the best bang for the buck, and it is a bargain for small- and medium-sized businesses. Cramer said Facebook has a great defense if regulators turn in on the company as it has become essential for small and medium business. The social media giant can also move into the payments space. Facebook gained 5% in November. Apple:\u00a0Analysts are bullish on Apple, citing the strength of the latest iPhone 12. Cramer reiterated that Apple's service revenue stream keeps growing and is still in infancy as Apple has the most loyal customer base. According to Cramer, the rapidly declining dollar is bullish for Apple and the next year's earnings estimates are low. Cramer said that Apple does not get enough credit for the wearables. \"They own the wearables space,\" he added. Cramer said that Apple should be valued like a tech company instead of a consumer packaged goods company. Alphabet:\u00a0Google parent Alphabet keeps growing, be it YouTube monetization or Google Cloud services. Once the vaccines are out and travel opens, Alphabet becomes an advertisement play.\u00a0 \"FAANG stocks are not going anytime soon,\" if you ask Cramer. Price Action:\u00a0On Monday, FB shares closed 0.30% lower at $276.97, AAPL closed 2.11% higher at $119.05, AMZN closed 0.85% lower at $3,168.04, NFLX closed lower by 0.13% at $490.70, and GOOG closed 1.81% lower at $1,760.74.

In addition to the digital tax, foreign-based vendors with no presence in Canada will also have to collect sales tax on products such as mobile apps, video gaming, and streaming they sell in the country. This measure is expected to raise $924.75 million (CAD 1.2 billion) over five years, as per Reuters. The Canadian government also reportedly plans to levy sales tax on short-term accommodation rentals and said digital platforms that facilitate such rentals currently do not have to impose the taxes. Why It Matters: Ottawa has chosen to move unilaterally in the imposition of the digital tax as it is concerned over delays in reaching a multilateral agreement being worked on by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, noted Reuters. The imposition of digital taxes by foreign governments has evoked threats of retaliation from the outgoing Donald Trump administration, Reuters reported. Price Action: On Friday, Facebook shares closed 0.3% lower at $276.97, Amazon shares closed 0.85% lower at $3,168.04 and Alphabet Class A and Class C shares closed 1.83% and 1.81% lower respectively at $1,754.40 and $1,760.74.

    "article_text":"More from WWD Courting businesses has become a crucial priority for Facebook. That\u2019s been clear from the moment Facebook turned Messenger into a major arena for service chatbots in 2016 and its expansion of shopping and communications tools on Instagram, Facebook\u2019s main platform and WhatsApp this year, among other features. The company\u2019s not done yet. In a major clue that Kustomer \u2014 which manages customer interactions across channels \u2014 will spread far and wide across the Facebook family of apps, the announcement post was penned by Dan Levy, vice president of ads and business products, and Matt Idema, chief operating officer of WhatsApp. Facebook is far from alone in trying to own online customer service and business chat using human and automated tools. Both Apple and Google have unleashed features aimed at retailers and other businesses, through tools such as Apple Business Chat for Messages and Google\u2019s Business Messages, which connect through its maps and search features. The latter expanded to cover all types of businesses this summer, generating new interest among retailers. Last month, H&M partnered with Nuance Communications \u2014 one of the major speech recognition and artificial intelligence-driven voice platforms \u2014 and Google\u2019s Business Messages to connect the fast-fashion company\u2019s virtual and live chat agents to Google Maps and Search. Meanwhile, as social media continues morphing into the digital era\u2019s version of shopping malls, rival companies are increasingly recognizing the fundamental need to pin down the customer service factor. Snap Inc. seems to have signaled as much with its own acquisition of Voca.ai, an AI and voice developer that caters to call centers, earlier this month. What complicates things for Facebook is that it encompasses more than a single channel or platform. But that\u2019s what makes Kustomer so attractive. Its specialty is wrangling so-called \u201comnichannel\u201d customer communications, as Levy and Idema described it. According to the post\u2019s authors, this acquisition is just the beginning. \u201cKustomer is one of many solutions in this arena,\u201d they wrote, \u201cand we\u2019ll continue to support the numerous options that businesses have to integrate their CRM platform of choice with our messaging services.\u201d"

    "article_text":"Stocks fell Monday as investors gave back some of last week\u2019s gains, which sent the S&P 500 and Nasdaq to fresh record highs and the Dow above 30,000 for the first time ever. Katie Nixon of Northern Trust Wealth Management and Vance Howard of Howard Capital Management joined Yahoo Finance Live to discuss. ADAM SHAPIRO: We've got three minutes to the closing bell. We want to invite into the stream Katie Nixon, Northern Trust Wealth Management, as well as Vance Howard. He's CEO at-- PM at Howard Capital Management. Good to have you both here. Jared Blikre also on deck. Katie, let me start with you. As we head into the closing bell, three P's you say people should pay attention to-- politics, policy, and the pandemic. Let me just ask you about the pandemic. Is that now rearview mirror and priced in? KATIE NIXON: Partly priced in, I think. But I do think, as we see continued good news on the rollout of the vaccine, the market will continue to react positively to that. So although I think a lot of the initial vaccine news is priced in, I think as we see the implementation, we'll get some more bumps. JEN ROGERS: Vance, the market's not perfect. Sometimes we overshoot to the downside. Other times, we overshoot to the upside. Do you think that we're in one of those moments right now, where we may have gotten a little bit ahead of ourselves, a little bit over our skis right now? VANCE HOWARD: No, not at all. We trade the HCM byline. So we're a mathematically driven shop. The math is pointing to us that we may have another 4% or 5% upside in December alone before the end of the year. The HCM byline is extremely positive right now. Being a quantitative measure that it is, it's usually been very, very accurate. We see the market pushing higher or even into the first and second quarter of 2021. Yeah, there's going to be some bumps in the road. There are bumps in the road in every single market that we have. So any pullback that we see in the market we see as a buying opportunity. ADAM SHAPIRO: Let's go to Jared Blikre as we get ready for that closing bell because, Jared, this has been a really terrific month despite what appears to be a down day today. One day does not a market make. JARED BLIKRE: That's right. And it is the last day of the month. Normal to see selling when we have the markets up this much. You look at the Dow. It's up 11.7% for the month. NASDAQ has some nice gains, a little bit less, 11.6%. S&P 500 sitting on 10 and 1\/2%. And a lot of these are setting some pretty big milestones. It's going to be the best month for the S&P 500 since 1987. So not too shabby right there. We are seeing some profit taking, especially in crude oil and the energy market. Now we've seen energy up. This is the second best month we've ever seen for energy, coming off a little bit today. I do want to note the US dollar index has been especially weak. If we take a look at a three-month chart here, interesting candle. This is called a hammer candle. Not final until we get confirmation the next day. But if this is an interim low, got to keep in mind that rising dollar could pressure equities in early December. But we just do have these incredible tailwinds at our back from the December seasonality, the so-called Santa Claus rally at the end of the month into the first few trading days of January. So just taking a look at the NASDAQ 100 here, we can see some pretty good leadership, at least for Apple. That's up 2 and 1\/2%. The other majors, big mega cap names, those are down. Google's off about 1.76% here. Amazon is off about 1%. Facebook off about 20 basis points. Tesla was in the green. Now off about 3% for the day, but nice gains for the month. Here's the closing bell. [BELL] JEN ROGERS: That's going to be good for November. Wow, the whole month now in the books, as we've been just going through the numbers here, looking at the Dow for our best November since 1928. You do have to remember, it was down today. On the day today, energy our worst performing sector, red across the board, except for the XLK. These are the S&P sectors, looking like it's going to eke out the smallest of gains, up just about 7\/10. Also, S&P 500, NASDAQ, best month since April 2020. So the story here, we've had rotation. We've had re-opening trade. We've had optimism on the political situation here in the US as well. And of course, who can forget the repeated Mondays of news on the vaccine front. And again, today we had more news coming out from Moderna. I want to bring in Katie Nixon with Northern Trust Wealth Management just to get a little bit of perspective here on all of this as we wrap up this month right now. We're heading into December. It's usually, seasonally, it can be a strong time. You know, just not that long ago, we were saying that we needed stimulus to see anything like this, right? That was the story early in the fall. Stimulus, stimulus, stimulus. Now what happens? Do we need something out of Congress by the end of the year? We're starting to hear some news reports this afternoon that McConnell wants to maybe get something through the end of the year. To continue this rally, do we need Washington? KATIE NIXON: Right, so I think this is an important time to distinguish between the market and the economy. I think right now, it's very clear that the market is sort of looking past what is going to be a difficult couple of months, regardless of fiscal stimulus. We're going to have probably more rolling lockdown lights here in the US to try to continue to control the coronavirus. But the market's really firmly focused on 2021, I think. The good news on the vaccine front that you've covered I think is giving investors a lot of optimism. Now would fiscal stimulus be an additional support for the market? Of course. And we do expect there to be a smaller, targeted, more tactical package probably passed either during the lame duck or soon, after the inauguration. But I don't think it's necessary at this point that we get a fiscal package in order to maintain the market rally. ADAM SHAPIRO: Vance, gotta give you credit. Back in February, you went 60% into cash. Now you are 100% in equities. Is that a little dangerous perhaps? VANCE HOWARD: Well, that's what we do for a living. You know, Katie made a good point. There's a difference between the economy and the stock market. Those are two different animals doing two different things. Clearly, that's become the norm history wise. But again, the byline gave us a sell in February. We moved 60% to cash. It gave us a solid buy the first week of April. We were 100% back in the market in the second week of April, which, you know, the byline's mechanical. It's not emotional. It's repeatable. We take the emotion out of the equation because I don't know what the stock market's going to do tomorrow. And I don't know what the economy's going to do tomorrow. So I could take that out of the equation and trade math. And that's been a great trade force. Clearly, any pullback we've had since April, we've been buying into. And into what Katie said, you know, there's a big difference between the economy, which the economy is not doing well. With the stock market, if you're playing different sectors like a large cap growth, you're having a great year. JEN ROGERS: Jared Blikre, back to you. Energy, last time, when we had talked on the three, wasn't down this much, ending the day off more than 5%, 5.4% here. The month, though, a different story. Give us some of the wrap-up on the month. JARED BLIKRE: Sure thing. Let's go straight to the YFi Interactive. This is our sector heat map. And you can see on the bottom right, we've got energy down 5 and 1\/2% today. And the leader today tech and healthcare. But you look at what's happened over the month. Energy is still the clear standout. Now it's up 28% in the upper left there, followed by financials, industrials and materials, and then tech. Tech still outperforming here, the S&P 500. It just gives you a sense that we have really outperformed, and we have this broad-based leadership, which is necessary to build a long-term secular bull market. It doesn't mean it has to happen overnight. And anything can happen in the coming weeks and days. But the groundwork is being laid here. So let's take a look at some of our canaries, some of our sentiment market leaders. And you see in the forefront here, MJ. That's the cannabis ETF, up 47%, nearly 50% for the month. And then the IPO market has been extremely hot. The Renaissance IPO ETF, IPO ticker, up 25% month to date. And then you have solar. That's the TAN ETF. Bets-- that's betting-- that's a gambling ETF. XRT is retail. Then you have SOX. That's a chip index. And that has been making record highs, along with XRT. So you have this broad-based real-- excuse me. You have this broad-based rally here. You throw in regional banks and the transports. A lot of these markets are making record highs, and it just bodes as to the-- or says that the market is strong right now. And just give you a couple more spaces here. Look at the cannabis space. Incredible gains for the month. You look at Aurora Cannabis, that's up 188%. And also the work from home trade not to be sneezed at. Even though we lost some of its shine this month, we still see Slack technology is up 67%, a lot of that having to do with the expected Salesforce buyout out of it. Guys. ADAM SHAPIRO: Katie, what should investors make of two very important things you point out? First that with these markets, it could be too much too fast because that's rarely a good thing. And the other, we keep talking about fiscal stimulus, but it could be too little too late. What should we investors make of all that? KATIE NIXON: Right, so on the fiscal side, with the vaccine coming, the fiscal stimulus becomes a bit less important to investors. However, there is a risk as we see some of the market, some of the economic indicators, rather, soften, whether it's on the manufacturing side or certainly on the employment front, that we don't get a fiscal bridge that's strong enough or long enough to sustain the economy through the next couple of months. So that certainly is a risk. And on the other front, you know, optimism is a great thing. There's a lot of optimism and a lot of bullishness in the market right now. As you referenced, having a broader market participation is certainly a very healthy sign. But there is a danger that we get overly optimistic at this period of time. And we're certainly seeing retail investor surveys like the AAII survey, other options-based data, show us that investors are pretty bullish now, which doesn't really mean anything in isolation, but it does present a little fragility to the market in terms of being able to withstand any bad news. JEN ROGERS: Vance, I'm just curious on Katy's point there, just about optimism. And usually, if I asked this question, somebody will say, oh, Jen, you can't time the market. But that's what you do. You move to cash, and you did well. So what signs are you looking for that would make you make a move like that again? What are the signals that you're looking at? VANCE HOWARD: Right, like I said, the HCM byline is, it's the backbone of our whole company. We've been trading it for 25 years now. It served us well. We sidestepped 2000, 2002. We sidestepped 2008. But you got to trade what's actually happening. And the market's going up. I mean, that's just what's happening. I don't know what the market's going to do next week or next year. All I've got is a guess, like anybody else. But what I do has a quantitative measures. And our quantitative measures are clearly pointing this market's going higher. The bulls have control. You know, the Dow Jones just hit an all-time record high last week, which is what we call a Christopher Columbus Day. It means that that's territory that's never ever been seen before. New highs are telling you something on major indexes that selling it, there's a lot of buying power out there. We're sitting on a record amount of cash. We're sitting on 1, 5, 10-year treasuries that are barely paying any interest. There's a tremendous amount of fuel in the engine they can push this market higher. But again, the HCM byline is positive. As long as it's positive, we're 100% in. ADAM SHAPIRO: Just remember, Vance, Christopher Columbus almost got slaughtered by the people when he got to their world. We appreciate your being here, Katie Nixon, Northern Trust Wealth Management, as well as Vance Howard, CEO and PM at Howard Capital Management. All the best to you both."

    "url":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/canada-plans-digital-tax-2022-213517424.html",
    "article_text":"By David Ljunggren OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada plans to impose a tax on corporations providing digital services from 2022 that will stay in place until major nations come up with a coordinated approach on taxation, the Finance Department said on Monday. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development is working on a common approach to ensure digital behemoths, such as Alphabet Inc's Google and Facebook Inc, pay their share of taxes as the coronavirus hammers budgets. Canada said it was concerned about a delay in reaching agreement. The threat of digital services taxes has prompted threats of trade retaliation from outgoing U.S. President Donald Trump's administration. The new tax would come into effect on Jan. 1, 2022, and remain in place until a common approach is agreed upon. The measure would raise federal revenues by C$3.4 billion ($2.6 billion) over five years, starting in the 2021-22 fiscal year. \"Canadians want a tax system that is fair, where everyone pays their fair share,\" Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland told legislators in the fall economic update. \"Canada will act unilaterally, if necessary, to apply a tax on large multinational digital corporations, so they pay their fair share just like any other company operating in Canada.\" More details are due in next year's budget. Foreign-based vendors with no physical presence in Canada will also have to start collecting sales taxes on products such as mobile apps, online video gaming and streaming. The measure should raise C$1.2 billion over five years. Ottawa also plans to oblige people renting out short-term accommodation to charge sales taxes, saying popular digital rental platforms do not currently have to impose the taxes. That puts hotels at a disadvantage, it added. The government is also clamping down on the award of stock options to prevent \"high-income individuals employed at large, long-established, mature firms\" from taking unfair advantage. From now on, a C$200,000 annual limit will apply to stock option grants for those people. Ottawa did not provide a definition of high-income individuals or mature firms. The rules will not apply to startups or emerging companies, which often cannot afford to pay competitive salaries and instead offer stock options. The new rules will generate about C$200 million in federal revenues, the Finance Department said. (Reporting by David Ljunggren; Editing by Peter Cooney)"

    "url":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/video\/companies-not-people-not-protecting-211002726.html",
    "article_text":"Scott Galloway, NYU Professor of Marketing and Author of 'Post Corona: From Crisis to Opportunity', joined Yahoo Finance Live to discuss his new book and his thoughts on big tech regulation. JEN ROGERS: I don't know if you heard me earlier, but I was saying you really threw a wrench in my day by having me read this book early. It's, uh-- it's, uh-- I guess I was going to say it's easy, but that makes it sound simple, but it's kind of like a page turner and it's what we talk about all the time. SCOTT GALLOWAY: Oh, thanks. JEN ROGERS: \"From Crisis to Opportunity\" though, what I get-- like, sometimes I'm reading it and I think this is OK, like it's going to turn out all right. We have the potential here to actually be better than we were before as a country, as a human race. And then I think, but wait, are we actually going to be able to take advantage of this opportunity? Are you optimistic given-- let's just talk about America-- how divided we are, income inequality, that we will be able to seize this opportunity for change here? SCOTT GALLOWAY: I think that's the correct question. And look, I've got to be honest, I'm a glass half empty kind of guy. And I would argue that we probably would have been better off the last 6 or 12 months listening more to the pessimists and less to the optimists. So I think our optimism as a nation and our view of exceptionalism has unfortunately morphed into an arrogance that's been a comorbidity. We've had more time to prepare for this. We spend more money on health care. We think of ourselves as being innovative. And we sit here today with record hospitalizations, and 5% of the world's population, and 25% of the infections and deaths. The Chinese word for crisis is risk and also juncture. It tries to combine those two meanings. And I do believe there are huge silver linings coming out of this pandemic, but it's not a default setting. America isn't-- you know, isn't what it is. It's what we make of it. And I would argue that we will look back on this moment either as having been, you know, what Vonnegut said that one step in the wrong direction, a step back, is a right step or this could be the signal or the juncture where we really turned down. I think it's up to us. There are some huge silver linings, but a default position that without sacrifice, without leadership that everything is going to turn out right so far I would argue the trajectory here is a negative one. ADAM SHAPIRO: You actually talk about several different issues. And I was, before we introduced you, talking about one of the things-- kind of the self-fulfilling prophecy when we talk about the weak get stronger. I think this is a portion of the book-- or rather the strong get stronger and the weak get weaker. Big tech got stronger and we use Tesla as the example. We keep talking about how wonderful Tesla is. That reinforces the belief that Tesla is wonderful. People buy the stock. Their borrowing costs are lower, and they can keep going forward. Are we setting ourselves up for a big fall? SCOTT GALLOWAY: Well, there's just examples everywhere. It took Apple 42 years to get to a trillion dollars and it took them five months to get to $2 trillion. Tesla's standing here in March was the fourth most valuable automobile company. Now, they're the most valuable and worth more than two, three, and four-- Daimler, Toyota, and Volkswagen-- combined. And we don't like to say this out loud, but I feel as if this pandemic has largely been invented when we're taking the top 10% into the top 1% and taking the rest of the 90% downward. There was a study by the Robin Hood Foundation that came out today that said 32% of people in New York have been forced to go to a food bank because of food insecurity since the beginning of the pandemic. So think about this, Adam. You're just as likely in New York State right now-- what we think of as the capital or, you know, the state that sort of embodies America-- you're just as likely to run into someone on the street who's had to go to a food bank than someone who has a college degree. So while, you know, we have flipped the script, if you will, capitalism is meant to be full-body contact violence and competition to unleash incredible prosperity such that we can be more empathetic and loving with our brothers and sisters across the nation. And it feels as if our collective efforts right now are to be more empathetic and loving with companies than with people. We've figured out a way to keep restaurants open. We've figured out a way to bail out small businesses and flatten the curve for rich people, but we haven't figured out a way to keep schools open. I mean, think about this. The two largest asset classes in America-- real estate and the stock market-- are at all-time highs. And by the way, 80% of those assets, by value, are owned by the top 10%. They're at all-time highs-- record prosperity, record savings rates. And at the same time, we have food insecurity. One in five households with kids have food insecurity. A third of Americans are worried they can't pay their rent. This is the best of times and the worst of times. We are barreling towards a nation with 3 million lords being served by 350 million serfs. We've decided to protect corporations, not people. Capitalism is literally collapsing on itself, unless it rebuilds that pillar of empathy supporting capitalism. JEN ROGERS: What responsibility do you think the four have-- Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google-- specifically as it goes to the issues you've been talking about and the inequality that we're seeing laid bare? Let's just take Amazon as an example. We just got through Black Friday. It's Cyber Monday. They are absolutely crushing it on sales. They've hired hundreds of thousands-- more than 400,000 people since the pandemic began. Most of those people though are warehouse workers making $15 an hour. What responsibility do those companies at the very top of the food chain you think have for not just where we've been, but really where we're going to affect change? SCOTT GALLOWAY: Yeah, so that's a meaningful question. So it struck me today-- and I don't think the two are correlated. I just meant to-- I want to use this to give your viewers and listeners a sense of proportion. In World War II, we were losing a third of the people that we are losing right now. And if you look at how many people Amazon is hiring every day, they're hiring about 1,400 people a day. That's about how many people each day are dying in America. And I just thought that was just sort of ironic when we talk about this K-shaped recovery. Now to your question on the responsibility these companies have, we'd like to think that these people have a code, and that they bring that code to work, and that they recognize the incredible blessings that America brings them, and that they want to prevent a tragedy of the commons. They want to pay their people well. I applaud Amazon for raising their minimum wage to $15 an hour. There's a lot to like about Amazon in my view in terms of what they've done with their employment base. They also have gamified municipalities such that we can transfer wealth from municipal fire, police, and school districts to the shareholders of Amazon through this ridiculous HQ2. They have also put small businesses out of business and prematurely euthanized big businesses by owning the rails, and anti-competitive behavior, and dumping products at prices through their access to cheap capital no other company can compete with. However-- however, I don't think it's smart-- I don't think it's a good strategy to wait on the better angels of billionaires. We can't wait on the generosity, and code, and personal conduct, and character of CEOs. To a certain extent, they're doing their job. It's we, as citizens, who are not doing ours. Specifically, we're not electing public officials that apply the same scrutiny around anti-trust, around anti-competitive behavior, around externalities when teens are getting depressed. We don't seem to want to hold these companies accountable or to the same standards we've held companies in the past. So if there's a culprit here, it's voters who aren't electing leaders that hold these companies to the same standards. If we're just going to wait for the better angels of Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg to show up, that is a bad strategy. ADAM SHAPIRO: Scott, I'm curious when you talk about capitalism on the way up, socialism on the way down, when you talk it's the voters who are bringing this upon ourselves. It doesn't sound like that's going to change, so where are we headed? It sounds like we're going to be headed to the 3 million you talk about-- bread and circuses like the old Roman Empire-- to keep the 330 million at bay. SCOTT GALLOWAY: Well, I'm actually-- I do think there's reasons for optimism. I think the Biden-Harris or the shadow of the Biden-Harris administration has fomented or catalyzed more positive change at Facebook and Twitter than in the last 10 years. I don't think it's an accident that all of a sudden Facebook and Twitter have found the technology and the will to start labeling misinformation around COVID-19 as misinformation. We've seen more of it in the last eight weeks than we've seen in the last eight years, and it's because the analogy I would use is you're seniors in high school and you've thrown the mother of all rager parties. And you get a text message on Sunday morning that your parents are coming home early and you're trying to clean up the house. There is the mother of all cleaning up their houses going on right now. Janet Yellen's appointment is very encouraging-- a more I don't want to call it activist, but more appointees that seem to believe in bilateral, multilateral cooperation, who seem to believe the regulation plays an important role, that will likely fund the CDC to the extent it warrants. $700 billion to the military, $7 billion to CDC. We're losing people at three times the velocity of World War II. It just seems like our priorities are a bit messed up here. And we have big tech, which has basically in my view, overrun Washington. So I am hopeful. There's some real silver linings here, but it's up to us to embrace those, and demand more of our leaders, and demand accountability, and realize that these companies are not people. We should not be protecting them. They're not concerned with the condition of our soul. They're not going to take care of us when we get older. Without structural change at a regulatory level, without a national complexion of sacrifice-- patriotism used to mean sacrifice. Now, it means stimulus. We planted victory gardens. We reached into our pockets. We didn't have our hand out. The notion that we would find wearing a mask to Walmart somehow tyrannical-- my mother in 1941 Britain slept in a makeshift bomb shelter and they passed out gas masks in the shape of Disney characters so the kids would put them on. And the idea that someone would say that this imposed on their individual freedom is just unthinkable. So we have a lot of soul searching to do here, but there's nothing wrong with America that can't be fixed with what's right with America. And I'm hopeful that a lot of those changes start in January. ADAM SHAPIRO: Scott, I've got to start wrapping up with you, but when you talk about your mother, I was thinking of my grandmother Hazel who drove a truck volunteer during World War II in Portland, Maine and the people of Portland are still terrified and stay off the roads. But I have to ask you, as I write up this discussion, we invite you into the program because you're someone people do listen to. What's the key message then because looking at the book, many of the things you say sound very pessimistic, and yet you say there's reason for hope. So that's my headline? What's the key message? SCOTT GALLOWAY: Capitalism fails unless it rests on a foundation of empathy and love. We have full-body contact violence at the corporate level. We let businesses go out of business. We let people get fired such that Apple can emerge and put Sun Microsystems out of business, and then we take that incredible prosperity and we're more empathetic with people. We fund social security so we can take 38% of seniors who are in poverty down to 11%. We fund Head Start. We have flipped the script and we've decided that capitalism means being loving and empathetic to corporations and Darwinistic and harsh towards individuals. Unless we flip it back and start deciding that capitalism is in the agency of others, and start letting corporations go out of business, and being harsh on corporations, and being more empathetic and generous with our citizens, capitalism-- the greatest system of its kind, the greatest upward lubricant of the middle class in history-- will collapse on itself. America isn't what it is. America is what we make of it. It is up to us, but it is time to go back to a system of America where capitalism rests on a pool of empathy. JEN ROGERS: Scott Galloway talking about industries may be going under. We didn't even get to talk about higher education, which you're in, so we'll have to dive into that another time. It's a great read. The book is \"Post Corona-- From Crisis to Opportunity.\" Scott Galloway, thanks so much for joining us. SCOTT GALLOWAY: Thank you."

    "url":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/vietnam-steps-online-crackdown-jailed-170100499.html",
    "article_text":"(Corrects term used in paragraph one to \"jailed activists\", not \"political prisoners\", in line with definition used in report) HANOI, Dec 1 (Reuters) - The number of jailed activists in Vietnam has reached its highest on record, according to a tally by Amnesty International, which in a report on Tuesday accused Facebook and Google of censorship in the Southeast Asian country. There are at least 170 \"prisoners of conscience\" in Vietnam, the report said, of which around 70 are currently serving jail terms for online activism, mainly on Facebook and Google's YouTube. \"Once the great hope for the expansion of freedom of expression in the country, social media platforms are fast becoming human rights\u2013free zones, where any peaceful dissent or criticism of the Vietnamese government is liable to be censored,\" the report said. The current number of prisoners of conscience in Vietnam is the highest that London-based Amnesty has reported since it began publishing the figures in 1996, an Amnesty spokesman told Reuters. Amnesty defines prisoners of conscience as people who have not used or advocated violence, but were imprisoned because of their identity or beliefs. Vietnam's foreign ministry, which handles enquires from foreign media, did not respond to a request for comment. Despite sweeping economic reform and openness to social change, Vietnam's ruling Communist Party retains tight control on media, tolerates little opposition and has intensified a crackdown on dissidents and online activists ahead of a key Party meeting next year. Last month, Reuters reported that Vietnam had threatened to shut down Facebook locally if it did not agree to censor more political content. Vietnam's government said at the time that Facebook should abide by local laws. Amnesty's report said the U.S. social media giants do not do enough to resist government pressure to censor posts. It cited interviews with Vietnamese activists who said their posts had been censored. Both Facebook and Google have said that they only restrict access to content if it violates local laws. One such law, Article 117, prohibits Vietnamese citizens from \"making, storing or spreading\" anti-state materials. (Reporting by James Pearson; Editing by Martin Petty)"

    "article_text":"But shortly afterward, Zoom announced it would temporarily remove its time limit for free users on Nov. 26 and Nov. 27. Does Microsoft's challenge spell trouble for Zoom, or is it too late for the tech giant to catch up? Image source: Microsoft. In October, Microsoft revealed that Teams had 115 million daily active users (DAUs), up over 50% from 75 million just six months earlier. Slack only had about 12 million DAUs last September, and it hasn't updated that figure since. That's why Microsoft is now setting its sights on Zoom. Zoom became a household name because it was free, easy to use, and hosted more users than traditional video conferencing services. But it also struggled with privacy and security problems as hundreds of millions of new users joined its platform. Therefore, it wasn't surprising to see Microsoft remove Teams' time limit. It's also allowing users who don't have Microsoft accounts or the Teams app to freely join meetings through a web browser -- which mirrors Zoom's streamlined browser-based meetings. Zoom's number of daily active meeting participants rose from 10 million at the end of 2019 to over 300 million in April. But that doesn't mean Zoom has 300 million DAUs since each individual user can be counted as multiple participants if they join more than one Zoom meeting per day. Microsoft also stated it had 200 million daily active participants in a single day back in April. Image source: Zoom. Zoom and Teams still can't be considered direct competitors, since Zoom is built on video calls while Teams is a unified communications platform for enterprise users. Microsoft's brand also doesn't seem to be strongly associated with video calls anymore, as seen with the tepid market response to its other Zoom competitor, Skype Meet Now, earlier this year. That's why Microsoft is now leveraging the strength of Teams in the enterprise market to enter the consumer-facing market. It launched Teams for consumers earlier this year, which\u00a0targets friends and families instead of co-workers, and removing time limits and login barriers might convince more people to try out the service. Unfortunately, I think it will still be tough for Microsoft to pivot Teams from the enterprise to mainstream users. Microsoft expanded Teams in the enterprise market with aggressive bundling strategies, but it lacks that advantage in the consumer market, where Zoom enjoys a first-mover's advantage. Teams will also stiff face competition from free alternatives like Facebook's Messenger Rooms and its own neglected Skype platform -- which still attracted 40 million DAUs back in\u00a0March. In other words, offering free all-day calls probably won't stop most people from using Zoom as a verb for video calls in general."

    "article_text":"By Yasin Ebrahim Investing.com - The Dow fell Monday on souring U.S.-China tensions amid reports the Trump administration is considering blacklisting two major Chinese companies. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.1%, or 335 points. The S&P 500 was down 0.5%, while the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.04%. Sentiment on stocks made a soft start to the week on reports that Chinese chipmaker SMIC and national offshore oil and gas producer CNOOC (NYSE:CEO) could be ban from accessing US investors On top of rising U.S.-China tensions, profit-taking on value stocks on concerns about a surge in infections over the coming weeks following the Thanksgiving holiday also weighed on sentiment. \"There is almost certainly going to be an uptick because of what has happened with the travel,\" Dr. Anthony Fauci, top infectious disease expert, told CNN's State of the Union. Energy was among the biggest decliners across the value sector, paced by weakness in oil prices as major producers meet to discuss whether to extend its output cuts that have helped limit the blow from falling demand in the wake of the pandemic. Industrials were also in the red as airlines fell sharply following a weaker outlook from JetBlue. JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ:JBLU) fell 3% after guiding fourth-quarter revenue to drop 70% year-over-year, compared with the prior guidance of a 65% decrease. The company said booking trends remain volatile and expected revenue recovery will be nonlinear through the fourth quarter and beyond. American Airlines Group fell 4%, (NASDAQ:AAL) Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) slipped 1%, while United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) was up 0.5%. Tech, meanwhile, struggled to advanced as the Fab 5, with the exception of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), continued to stutter. Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) were in the red.

    "article_text":"To the victors go the spoils, the saying goes. That certainly holds true with internet companies, where several definite winners have emerged, namely the FANG stocks. The four household names are plays on some of the hottest technology trends, including cloud computing, streaming media, smart homes and artificial intelligence. CNBC's \"Mad Money\" host Jim Cramer coined the acronym FANG in 2013 to collectively refer to the four high-growth internet stocks. The term caught on in part because headline writers love playing with the word. Some examples: \"The FANG Stocks Bite Back\" and \"FANGs Retracted: Netflix, Other Top Nets Lose Bite.\" Take the first letter of each stock and you get FANG. In October 2015, Google restructured and placed its legacy business under an umbrella corporation called Alphabet Inc. Alphabet is now the parent company of Google and subsidiaries like Chronicle, Verily and Waymo. But investors stuck with the acronym FANG rather than switch to FANA. Headline writers couldn't do much with the latter. Beyond FAANG stocks, other variations on FANG have been proposed. So far this year, through Nov. 27, it is up 49.1%. The ETF rebounded from the coronavirus stock market crash to reach an all-time high of 208.27 intraday on Nov. 27. The FANG stocks have been outperforming the broader stock market this year. Netflix stock has been consolidating for the past 19 weeks with a buy point of 575.47. It closed the regular session Nov. 27 at 491.36. Netflix stock has benefited from consumers turning to its service in record numbers for entertainment while self-quarantining during the Covid-19 pandemic. The companies in the FANG group are facing a host of pressures now. Amazon.com and Google have come under regulatory scrutiny for possible anti-competitive business practices. Facebook and Google have been criticized for lack of data privacy and security. And Netflix is confronting a flurry of new competitors in streaming video as well as a mounting debt load associated with content production. Facebook and Google have been hurt by a drop in advertising spending on their platforms during the coronavirus pandemic. Plus, a recession could negatively impact all four FANG stocks. Facebook is under pressure to moderate its platform better to weed out hate speech, fake news and other unwanted content. YOU MAY ALSO LIKE:"

    "article_text":"\nWe are playing fast and loose with the Dow milestones above. Reporting the milestone closes obscures the fact that the Dow went back \u2013 sometimes way back \u2013 below those close figures at times before clearing the next milestone. Arguably, the most important figures are the times to doubling, but even these are fleeting moments that mostly cluster around bull markets.\n \nThe fact is that the Dow is a large number and has been since the '80s. The Dow moving from 100 to 1,000, for example, is a larger magnitude of a move (10 times) than from 10,000 to 20,000 (two times). Looking at tenfold increases as opposed to doubling shows that the Dow took 66 years to go from 100 to 1,000, and just 27 years to go from 1,000 to 10,000 (1999). This definitely shows an acceleration, but it is somewhat unlikely that we will see another tenfold increase in that compressed timeline, as it took two incredible bull markets in the '80s and '90s to make it happen.\n \nWhat the Dow does have going for it now is the inertia of large numbers. A jump of 1,000 points is not nearly as much of a challenge for the Dow as it was in the 1896 through 1990 period because 1,000 points represents a smaller percentage increase as the Dow continues to grow. That said, this recent run-up in the Dow is still incredible given the challenging economic times it powered through.\n \nHowever, like previous Dow milestones, the index can and likely will slide back and forth across 30,000 a number of times. Remember, the Dow was down below 20,000 as recently as this past March. So the milestone is fun to report and makes for a good headline, but it isn't going to change your investment outlook any more than the Dow closing at 29,921 at the end of last week did.\n \nStocks \nIndex Trading Strategy & Education \nEconomics \nUS Markets \nTrading \nGovernment & Policy"

    "url":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/apple-suppliers-exodus-china-won-220000376.html",
    "article_text":"(Bloomberg) -- The splintering of the global tech supply chain that began during President Donald Trump\u2019s watch looks set to persist under his successor. Apple Inc., the largest of the many tech giants that rely on Chinese factories to make their gadgets, will move some production of its iPads and MacBooks to Vietnam. Key assembly partner Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., known also as Foxconn, has allocated $270 million in new investments to the Southeast Asian country. Those moves presage a larger and longer-term migration that may have ramifications for the iPhone maker as well as China\u2019s role as workshop to the world. Foxconn founder Terry Gou coined the term \u201cG2\u201d to describe the trend of a unified supply chain splitting into at least two. Company Chairman Young Liu said in August that the likes of India, Southeast Asia and the Americas could each in the future end up with a dedicated manufacturing ecosystem of their own. The trend now looks irreversible as other countries including India and Vietnam are boosting their infrastructure and efforts to lure manufacturers through lower costs and fewer geopolitical worries. \u201cAs China gets more expensive, and as U.S. politics have been unpredictable, companies have shifted production of some goods out of China. That trend will continue as China gets more expensive and as Vietnam and India improve their competitiveness,\u201d said Dan Wang, a technology analyst at Gavekal Dragonomics. Read more: Apple\u2019s Shifting Supply Chain Creates Boomtowns in Rural Vietnam Trump\u2019s trade hostilities against China caused many manufacturers to shift production capacity to neighboring countries like Vietnam and further afield to sites in Mexico and India, in order to avoid being slapped with punitive tariffs and to mitigate future sanctions risk. Apple, whose Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook orchestrated the creation of its current Chinese-centric production chain, has resisted a large-scale move but in recent years has increasingly explored alternatives. The Cupertino, California-based company is continuing to add iPhone capacity in India through its assembly partners, aided by Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s policy to attract top-tier smartphone companies to make their gadgets locally for export. Pegatron Corp., the last of the major iPhone assemblers to arrive in the country, announced earlier this month it is injecting 11 billion rupees ($150 million) into its Indian unit and will start production there as soon as late 2021. Back at home, the iPhone maker has been lobbying the U.S. government to support local chip production with tax breaks. Its key supplier Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. is planning a chip fab in Arizona, though the modest scale and technology of that facility would suggest it will service smaller customers, at least to begin with. Beyond Apple, Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google has placed orders with Foxconn to assemble key components for its servers in Wisconsin, at the under-utilized facility that has to date been most famous for what it hasn\u2019t produced. Mass production there is expected to go ahead in the first quarter. Pegatron officials said earlier this month that the company plans to also set up manufacturing operations in the U.S. to serve other customers. Wistron Corp., another Taiwanese contract manufacturer that handles iPhone orders as well as laptop and server production for other American customers, announced plans earlier this month to add capacity in Mexico and Taiwan. It\u2019s also buying a Western Digital Corp. factory in Malaysia. Chairman Simon Lin said in March that half of Wistron\u2019s capacity can be located outside of China as soon as 2021, with Vietnam operations ramping up and the company seeing India as a key strategic site for the next decade due to its market size and resources. Trump\u2019s tariffs on Chinese-made products have also forced other international companies to rethink their manufacturing operations. Nintendo Co. now has some of its Switch console production handled by Sharp Corp. in Malaysia, after it asked its main assembly partner Foxconn Technology Co. to offer geographic alternatives to its core China operations. Foxconn Tech, a major entity of the Foxconn Technology Group and a Sharp shareholder, made the connection between the two Japanese firms.

Earlier this year, China\u2019s Luxshare Precision Industry Co. struck a deal to acquire Wistron\u2019s iPhone production facilities in the country, a move that will create the first mainland company to assemble Apple\u2019s marquee handsets. Compatriot BYD Electronic International Co. is also now splitting iPad orders with Foxconn and Compal Electronics Inc., a person familiar with the matter said. AirPods orders, meanwhile, are now dominated by Luxshare and another compatriot, GoerTek Inc. It took Foxconn 30 years to build up its massive Chinese operations and India or any other region is unlikely to catch up overnight, Foxconn\u2019s Liu said earlier this month. The supply chain shift will take time, \u201cand China will remain a major electronics manufacturing hub for at least the next five years,\u201d Gavekal\u2019s Wang added. \u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P."
