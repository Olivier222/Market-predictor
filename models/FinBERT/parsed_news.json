    "article_text":"Image source: Getty Images. Shares of software giant Salesforce were down big on Wednesday despite a third-quarter earnings report that checked all the boxes. Revenue was up 20% to $5.42 billion, beating analyst estimates by $160 million. Adjusted earnings per share came in at $1.74, up from $0.75 in the prior-year period and $0.99 higher than analysts were expecting. Salesforce also boosted its outlook for the current fiscal year, calling for revenue between $21.10 billion and $21.11 billion, up about 23% from last year. For the next fiscal year, Salesforce foresees revenue growth of 21% to a range of $25.45 billion to $25.55 billion. Salesforce may be trying to compete more broadly with Microsoft, which offers CRM software that competes with Salesforce as well as Teams collaboration software that competes with Slack. The price tag is steep, with Salesforce paying nearly 30 times run-rate revenue. The company clearly thinks it's a price worth paying, but investors appear to disagree. While Salesforce stock was struggling on Wednesday, shares of the software giant remain up about 37% so far this year. Removing the spending threshold for Walmart+ members will make the service a closer competitor to Amazon Prime. Prime still has a big advantage when it comes to product selection, but now Walmart+ members won't need to pad their shopping carts to qualify for free shipping. Shares of Walmart were down 1.1% by early Wednesday afternoon. The stock remains up 27% since the start of the year."

    "article_text":"While the surveys aren't perfectly comparable, the recent results show a positive trend for Amazon. That trend also shows up when asking people where they go to research potential purchases. Sixty-five percent of respondents said Amazon, 45% said Alphabet's Google, and 25% said another online marketplace such as Walmart, Target, or eBay. A similar question in a January 2018 survey saw more people select search engines (69%) versus Amazon (61%). Image source: Amazon.com. Not only are people starting their product searches on Amazon.com, but they're also spending more. Forty-five percent of respondents to the ChannelAdvisor survey said they're spending more time on Amazon than they did before March. That compares with just 35% for other marketplaces. While Amazon's sales growth hasn't kept up with the online sales booms at Walmart and Target, it's still outpacing the broader e-commerce market. Its online store revenue increased 38% last quarter, third-party seller services increased 55%, and North American revenue increased 39%. U.S. e-commerce sales grew about 37%, according to data from the U.S. Census Bureau. While a couple of percentage points of outperformance might not seem like much, investors should consider how much Amazon already dominates the market. Continued gains in market share when Amazon already accounts for about 40% of online sales is quite impressive. It's billions of dollars in absolute terms, which would amount to a considerable amount of growth at most of Amazon's competitors. Consumers are planning to maintain their new online shopping habits in the future. Fifty-two percent of respondents said they plan to do more online shopping in the future than they did before the pandemic. That compares with 38% of respondents who expected to continue shopping more online in May. More younger people expected to shop online more frequently in the future than older people. And younger people have also favored Amazon since the start of the pandemic. That should lead to continued share gains for Amazon over the next few years. While investors can't expect total U.S. e-commerce to grow over 30% in 2021 and beyond, they should see Amazon's gross merchandise volume continue to outpace the broader market, which historically grew around 15% per year. And as its marketplace services become more important and more people use its search engine more, it should see its high-margin businesses grow even faster than its retail operations.\u00a0 Amazon's already producing strong profits amid the pandemic despite massive investments in safety protocols, personnel, and warehouses. When it can curb those investments, but sustain its outsize growth, it'll reward investors with some massive operating profits."

    "article_text":"When the pandemic hit, it would have been easy to assume that Target would be one of those struggling to keep up as people shopped online. But Target has actually been a huge winner during the public health crisis, and it's because the company is leveraging its physical stores with digital solutions. Image source: Target. One innovation that's been extremely valuable is Drive Up at Target. Customers order their goods online, and when they go to a designated parking spot at the store, someone brings their items out and even loads them in the car with minimal interaction with the shopper. From order to pickup, the process can take less than an hour. Some stores are starting to retrofit their parking lots and buildings to make this process even more seamless as it becomes more popular. And selection available for Drive Up is growing and could soon even include groceries, saving people shopping time on even more items.\u00a0 Target also acquired Shipt in 2017 to enable customers to have someone else do their shopping for them and have goods delivered to their homes. Shipt isn't a Target exclusive, but as its owner Target is a key retailer on the platform.\u00a0 For years, Target has been investing in making digital sales that leverage its stores. And in 2020, those investments have paid off.\u00a0 Financial results overall and digital sales more specifically are starting to be impressive for Target. In the third quarter of 2020, comparable sales were up 20.7% and same-day services -- which includes Pick Up, Drive Up, and Shipt -- grew 217% versus a year ago.  Target isn't matching Amazon's overall product growth rate\u00a0of 32.8% or Shopify's 96% growth, but you can see that digital sales growth is outpacing both companies. At the very least, Target is more than holding its own, and that's impressive as retailers across the world come under pressure from the COVID-19 pandemic.\u00a0 Target is never going to be the growth stock other online retailers can be, but it's a company that's built a nice niche in retail. It can leverage stores to provide convenient services to customers, and I could see its current growth continuing as it brings more grocery products to its digital services.\u00a0 From an investment standpoint, the stock is still relatively inexpensive considering the current growth rate. And it comes with a decent dividend yield of 1.5% at recent prices. Don't count Target out as a retail stock. It has developed the digital tools it needs to succeed in retail and has the brick-and-mortar presence most other retailers can't compete with. That'll be a valuable combination in the future.\u00a0"

    "article_text":"Charles Schwab\u2019s Chief Investment Strategist Liz Ann Sonders joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss her market outlook for 2021, and why she thinks the economy has more rough terrain to traverse. JULIE HYMAN: Well, our next guest calls that vaccine or vaccines a light at the end of the tunnel but we're still in that tunnel. Liz Ann Sonders is joining us now. She is Charles Schwab Chief Market Strategist. Liz Ann, it's always great to see you. And you're out with an extensive note looking ahead to next year and what we can expect. And one of the things that we can expect is a vaccine or vaccines but it could be rocky in the interim. It doesn't look like it's necessarily going to be rocky for stocks in the very short term. What do you think? LIZ ANN SONDERS: Well, obviously from an economic standpoint, the virus represents a pull forward-- I mean the vaccine represents a pull forward of a return to maybe more normal economic growth but the virus and the resurgence of it and the impact it's having, some of the lockdowns we're seeing across the country, is having the effect of pushing down economic growth. Now the market has done an extraordinary job really since the beginning of this crisis of looking across the chasms, however large, created by the virus sort of to the other side. But I think near-term the biggest risk in the market is actually a function of what's happened in the market, the huge gains that we saw, especially in areas that had not been the pandemic winners in November, small caps having a record month. And what we saw in conjunction with the initial Pfizer vaccine news was a shift from sentiment having really only been frothy in certain pockets of the market, in the single stock options market by the newly minted day traders, and it became pervasively optimistic. So I think that enthusiasm, complacency, euphoria, whatever term you want to use, in and of itself represents a bit of a risk in the near term and could mean that even a fairly minor catalyst, which could be economic data, might be enough to put us into another one of these pullback phases that we've had three times since the low in March. BRIAN SOZZI: Liz Ann, just staying on that topic of the market perhaps being too frothy. Is it too frothy relative to where you see corporate earnings going, let's say in the back half of next year? LIZ ANN SONDERS: Well, it's funny, corporate earnings obviously are the denominator in your traditional PE equation and there's no question the forward PE is elevated relative to history, it's in line with where we were back in 2000. For some of the high momentum stocks, the big five, the valuation is not [INAUDIBLE] underlying fundamentals are much stronger now than was the case back in 2000. But valuation we think of as this fundamental indicator because it's got quantifiable components to it but the reality is valuation is as much a sentiment indicator as anything else. So I think the reason why we've seen such multiple expansion is tied into the enthusiasm that we're seeing in many sentiment measures. I think earnings look fine into 2021, especially starting in the second quarter when the comps get very easy. But we're going to need to see that stream of earnings persist because using things like 0% interest rates as a basis for justifying elevated valuations, that doesn't persist forever. But as long as sentiment stays elevated, it probably means valuations stay elevated. MYLES UDLAND: Liz Ann, you don't have a price target in the note but I think there's a suggestion in there that's very interesting on the index level when you look at the composition of leading sectors next year. You outline some of the dynamics around how much of the market cap is tied to the big five stocks versus the rest of the index. I'm wondering if you can kind of talk through for our viewers that thought as we look at next year's potential leadership type groups? LIZ ANN SONDERS: Sure. And we don't do year end price targets. Frankly, I think that that's an incredibly silly exercise. I'm not sure I understand the value of it, especially [INAUDIBLE] bolsters how the markets are and the folks that do it how often they have to change those targets throughout the year. But in terms of the concentration that really hit a peak in early September, at which point the big five, so Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Google and Facebook, had a 6,200 basis point spread in year-to-date performance over the other 495. At that point, which was the first sort of launch to new highs for the S&P and NASDAQ. Those five stocks on average were up 65% and the other 495 were only up 3%. I actually think that answers the question I get all the time, which is, is the stock market disconnected from the economy? That was sort of the reality at the time, a small subset of not just survivors but thrivers and still a lot of pain under the surface. Then we've had these series of rotations since early September and they've had growth to value flavor, they've had defensive to cyclicals, they've had COVID winners to COVID losers, it's been at the sector level. And I think heading into next year I think we'll likely see the market continue to try to find some leadership in the more cyclical areas but it's going to need that sustainable improvement in economic growth. In the meantime, I think that those rotations will happen in fits and starts and the best strategy for investors to take is not to try to anticipate them in advance but maybe rebalance more frequently and use those moves and give you the opportunity to sort of trim into strength in certain areas and add into weakness as opposed to trying to anticipate those rotations in advance. JULIE HYMAN: And you sort of illustrated that in your note, Liz Ann with what you called a quilt, which I quite liked, which was showing the different sectors, showing different leadership at different times in different colors as we saw that sort of rotation go through. Do you think that that sort of diversification that you're talking about should also go for different asset classes when you're talking about the periodic rebalancing? LIZ ANN SONDERS: Absolutely. In fact, the normal way to show a quilt like that and we have a version that's copyrighted, is asset classes. So US stocks, international stocks, components of the bond market, treasuries, corporate bonds, high yield, cash. But I decided to take a twist on it for the '21 outlook and look at the sectors on a monthly basis. But I actually think that diversification becomes an easier sell and arguably already has been in a year like this year. We've been in this mindset of eh, why be diversified, US equities are the only game in town. Even this year, the total return on long bonds and medium term bonds, 30 year treasuries, 10 year treasuries, the total return, not the yield, the total return, is actually better than the total return on the S&P 500. You've had some non US markets outperform. And we think as we head into 2021, diversification will pay dividends not just within an asset class like US equities across sectors, but across asset classes, including international, non US. Not that they're going to take over the leadership and leave the US in the dust but I think correlations coming down means it will be an opportunity to actually add some value in portfolios through that long held discipline of diversification that has maybe justifiably been shunned in the last several years. JULIE HYMAN: Liz Ann, it's always great to get your thoughts, especially as we look ahead to 2021. And I also love, forget about the price targets, it is sort of it's a tough game to strategize. LIZ ANN SONDERS: I get it. JULIE HYMAN: Liz Ann Sonders, thanks so much. Charles Schwab. LIZ ANN SONDERS: Thanks. My pleasure. JULIE HYMAN: Chief Market Strategist. Appreciate it."

This highlights the efficiency and reliability of AWS\u2019s innovative cloud products and services.Boom Supersonic is developing Overture, which is going to be the first supersonic flight after decades.The company is leveraging AWS\u2019s robust computing, storage and security services in a bid to innovate commercial supersonic air travel and meet the security and compliance regulations.More precisely, it will be utilizing AWS\u2019 machine learning, Internet of Things, managed database,and analytics services for its Overture.Additionally, the company is planning to leverage Amazon Simple Storage Service to build a data lake for its manufacturing operations. Also, Boom Supersonic looks to gather and process real-time data from its manufacturing equipment with the help of AWS IoT Core. The recent move by Boom Supersonic is in sync with AWS\u2019s strategy to expand clientele.Apart from this, MercadoLibre, an e-commerce dominant in Latin America, recently selected AWS as its primary cloud provider.Further, AWS got recently selected by Zalando as the official cloud provider. Zalando will leverage AWS\u2019s machine learning services, analytics, compute, database, networking, serverless, storage and other services in order to enhance the shopping experience.Further, AWS was selected by Standard Chartered Bank. Moreover, the latter signed a five-year agreement to leverage AWS\u2019sreliable infrastructure and cloud services across its entire business in a bid to digitalize its operations and deliver personalized banking services across its 60 markets worldwide.Further, Carrier Global entered a multi-year agreement with AWS to develop the Lynx platform with the help of the latter\u2019s IoT, analytics and Machine Learning services.Notably, expansion will help Amazon in maintaining the dominant position in the cloud market, where competition is intensifying with the growing endeavors of peers like Microsoft MSFT, Alphabet\u2019s GOOGL Google and Alibaba BABA.Per the latest Canalys data, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud and Alibaba Cloud acquired worldwide cloud market share of 19%, 7% and 6%, respectively, in third-quarter 2020, while Amazon led with a 32% share. \u00a0 Amazon.com, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Amazon.com, Inc.

    "url":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/marc-benioff-wants-salesforce-to-hit-50-billion-in-annual-revenue-144421303.html",
    "article_text":"Benioff started Salesforce in 1999, and since then it\u2019s become one of the top enterprise software companies in the world with a market cap greater than $219 billion. By 2018, Salesforce was doing $10 billion-plus in annual revenues, and now the founder wants to more than quadruple that amount. \"We're going to deliver over $25.5 billion next year in revenue. I've always had this $50 billion dream for Salesforce, so let's see us go there,\" the billionaire said. The Slack deal, which was first reported last week, came as a surprise to some, given that Benioff said in August the company was \"not in a good M&A environment,\" but suggested things could change. Benioff admitted to Yahoo Finance that he didn't see the opportunity coming, but Salesforce president and COO Bret Taylor \u2014 who joined the company in 2016 \u2014 and Slack CEO Stewart Butterfield shared a \"tremendous vision\" with Benioff of the two companies coming together. \"This is one of the most exciting stories I've ever heard \u2014 and this story is a story of two companies coming together, and it's a 1+1=3 equation,\" Benioff said, who has called the combination \"a marriage made in heaven.\" According to Benioff, Salesforce's vision was to be a social enterprise. In Slack, he saw a \"tremendous social interface\" and, when combined with Salesforce's products, it would make its customers \"much more productive\" and able to work anywhere \u2014 especially as COVID-19 makes working from home a wider standard. \"Wow, the demonstration is incredible, and what I saw, I think, is going to just truly excite our customers, and they're going to have the ability to have a next-generation capability for their companies,\" the CEO added. Salesforce Customer 360 allows the CRM provider to bring together fragmented parts of a business like sales, marketing, commerce, service, etc. into a single source to allow for those enterprises to make better and smarter decisions about their customers. And according to Benioff, adding Slack as the new interface for Customer 360 is the \"icing on the cake.\" The billionaire explained that by \u2018layering\u2019 Slack technology will make 360 more collaborative and mobile. \u201cYou can automate any workflow. This is very cool and very different than anything I've ever seen. It's kind of a dream that I've always had that we could have this type of a user interface and now with Salesforce and Slack coming together we do,\" Benioff added. What's more, he noted that 90% of Slack customers are already Salesforce customers. Benioff plans to nudge his other CEO friends to join Slack, and intends to leverage Salesforce's massive sales team to sell Slack. For the third quarter, Salesforce reported revenue of $5.42 billion, up 20% year-over-year. The company expects to do $5.67 billion in the current quarter, Benioff noted. \"The sequential growth is extraordinary, and that gives us the ability because we're strong right now, we're hitting record revenues, record profit, record margins, record cash flows, that we have the ability to do something\u201d like the deal with Slack, the CEO said. \u201cWhen you're strong, you want to take your company, your organization to another level. That's the opportunity. And we're going to take that opportunity,\u201d he added."

    "headline":"All the Happiness Money Can Buy in the Winter of Covid-19",
    "url":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/happiness-money-buy-winter-covid-143001654.html",
    "article_text":"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- As the saying goes, money can\u2019t buy happiness. That certainly seems to be true in 2020 \u2014 rates of depression and anxiety are up, even though many households have more cash on hand than usual. Savings rates in the U.S. spiked to a previously unfathomable 34% in April and sat at a still-high 14% in September. Savings in the U.K. have also hit record highs, with households saving 29% of their disposable income. There must be some way to use this extra cash to brighten our spirits. Even if gyms, cafes, hotels and restaurants aren\u2019t safe. Even if travel is restricted. Even if the best things in life are free. After all, in a pandemic, those free activities \u2014 like visiting a house of worship or game nights and dinner parties \u2014 can be deadly. To find out whether it\u2019s realistic to throw money at the problem of Covid-induced unhappiness, I called Elizabeth Dunn, a psychology professor at the University of British Columbia and a coauthor of \u201cHappy Money: The Science of Happier Spending.\u201d One area she says is definitely worth the money: exercise. Physical activity is really good for our emotional well-being; it can be just as effective as medication in treating depression, studies have found, even if it\u2019s just 30 minutes of walking three times a week. And, bereft of other distractions, lots of us did get more exercise over the summer \u2014 cycling, running, even inline skating. But winter\u2019s arrival may make moving around more expensive. One does not need to splurge on a Peloton (although many have \u2014 in September, the company reported quarterly sales had soared 172%). To prepare for indoor winter workouts, I bought a used bike trainer on Facebook Marketplace and a pair of weights from Amazon for a total of about $200. Bodyweight classes, yoga and Pilates don\u2019t take much, if any, special equipment, and can be found free on Instagram or YouTube, or for a small monthly fee through apps like MindBody. But don\u2019t give up on going outside, says Dunn. A raft of studies have linked spending time in nature to better mental health. And, of course, Covid transmission rates are far lower outdoors, making it possible to socialize relatively safely as long as you stay outside. As the days and nights get colder in the Northern Hemisphere, it may be necessary to get creative to remain in nature, and this introduces a new category of things to buy: stuff to keep us warm. Think beyond firepits and patio heaters, which at this point may be available only on backorder. A wool base layer? A down sleeping bag? Those chemical hand-and-toe warmers you bring skiing? Some outdoor gear companies even make battery-heated jackets. I\u2019ve been staying warm(ish) while socializing outdoors by keeping a travel mug of scalding herbal tea at my side. Another way to invest in happiness is to buy experiences. We\u2019re happier buying experiences than material goods, several studies have suggested. Indeed, pre-pandemic, it was hard to go a week without reading about the \u201cexperience economy\u201d or millennials\u2019 commitment to buying memories rather than stuff. It\u2019s just that buying things to do has gotten a lot harder. \u201cIt\u2019s still possible to buy experiences, but they might look a little bit different,\u201d Dunn says. \u201cWe don\u2019t usually think of buying takeout as an experience, but on Saturday nights I\u2019ve been ordering takeout from the kind of fancy restaurant I would normally be going out to for date night.\u201d It makes the day feel special, and it\u2019s something to look forward to all week. And indeed, she says, \u201cpart of the reason experiences are powerful is anticipation.\u201d Sometimes looking forward to something is more pleasurable than the experience itself. That\u2019s why Dunn and a friend are planning a trip to a dude ranch in the summer of 2021. \u201cWe could probably wait to start planning this trip,\u201d she admits, but filling out their shared Google doc is giving them something fun to do now. Another way to buy an experience is to buy more free time. People feel much happier when they outsource tasks they find unpleasant, Dunn\u2019s research shows, but guilt often stops us from doing this. After all, it\u2019s work we could be doing ourselves. Nonetheless, she says, if you hate cooking \u2014 or are just getting sick of having to do it day after day after day \u2014 go ahead and buy some ready-made meals. If you\u2019d rather not do the snow shoveling, hire someone to plow the driveway. You\u2019ll also be supporting local businesspeople. The last and best way to buy happiness: Help others. A tranche of Dunn\u2019s research focuses on what academics call \u201cprosocial spending\u201d and its powerful effects. Charitable donations bring us joy; we feel even better when we can see the tangible effects of our giving. So make a donation to your local food pantry, or send a DoorDash order to a friend going through a hard time. Deliver a homemade dinner to a lonely relative, even if you have to leave it on their porch. \u201cGiven how many people are suffering right now, those of us lucky enough to have full-time, paying jobs might consider using our money to help other people out,\u201d Dunn says. \u201cMy research has shown that\u2019s a really good way to buy happiness for ourselves.\u201d How do you gauge how much generosity is enough? An old rule of thumb: Give until you feel good. This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.

    "article_text":"Retailers may hear their cash registers jingling all the way this Christmas, as the National Retail Federation forecasts holiday sales between November and December will grow 3.6% to 5.2% this year compared to last year. Yet lurking beneath this cheery outlook is a dark secret that could make the season that follows very bleak, as many retailers may still end up heading into bankruptcy. Image source: Getty Images. The industry is already fighting with one hand tied behind its back as states impose new lockdowns and stay-at-home orders to confront rising numbers of COVID-19 cases. In September, accounting firm BDO said 18 retailers had sought Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection over the first six months of 2020, while another 11 filed in the two months prior to it publishing its semi-annual bankruptcy report. Over 10,200 stores had closed so far this year. Industry site Retail Dive\u00a0keeps a running list of major retailers that have declared bankruptcy and says 29 have sought court protection in 2020, including J.C. Penney, Pier 1 Imports, Tailored Brands, Lord & Taylor, Tuesday Morning, GNC, and most recently Guitar Center. But that may not even be the worst of it. There's a ticking time bomb in the industry that could go off for many retailers in the months ahead. According to Bloomberg, data from real estate firm CoStar Group shows unpaid rent now totals $52 billion since the beginning of April. Despite some of that getting repaid, the bill keeps growing for others who will have a difficult time paying it back, let alone paying the current rents due. Gap, however, said that to get out from under the weight of the rent bills piling up, it ended up negotiating with its landlords and executed several cash buyout agreements totaling $57 million. Bloomberg also reported that burger chain Red Robin Gourmet Burgers\u00a0received default notices from its landlords, but had negotiated amendments with half of them and was still in negotiations with the others. The problem is that the retail landscape remains uncertain, despite the hopeful tone of the industry trade group's Christmas predictions.\u00a0 Retail sales in October were depressed once again. Commerce Department data shows that retail sales excluding autos rose a disappointing 0.1% from last year. Digging deeper, though, it found that it was primarily due to building materials and grocery stores that we saw any gains. Apparel retailers saw sales fall 3%, department stores were down 4%, and electronics and appliance stores dropped 5%. Now with cases of COVID-19 rising sharply, states closing shop again, and hopes for any new stimulus checks mired in politics, the ability to generate sales to make those rent payments will grow difficult. Even if sales move online, Amazon.com\u00a0is going to capture the lion's share of those sales. Its third-quarter e-commerce sales of over $75 billion already exceed by 10% the total the retailer generated in last year's holiday fourth quarter. This Christmas is going to be huge. Walmart\u00a0and Target\u00a0will pick up much of the rest of the dollars spent online, with all other retailers fighting over the scraps. With the time bomb of rent they've been deferring ticking away, plus the rents they currently owe, many retailers are about to see this situation blow up in their faces."

The ETF has outperformed its large-cap competitors over the long term, including offerings from Schwab, State Street, BlackRock, and other Vanguard funds like the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF. The Vanguard Large-Cap ETF has a three-year total return of 48.5% and a five-year total return of 92.2% as of Oct. 31.

By comparison, the S&P 500 has an annualized return of about 9.5% since Dec. 2010.   In terms of fees, its expense ratio is a minuscule 0.04%, which is just about as low as it gets. There are only a handful of ETFs in this category with lower expense ratios than that.

    "url":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/alphabet-ups-self-driving-game-140802630.html",
    "article_text":"Autonomous driving technology, which combines semiconductors, simulation software, electronics testing equipment and measuring instruments, predictive algorithms and most importantly advancing AI, is constantly gaining steam in the data-driven world with bigwigs like Alphabet GOOGL, Amazon AMZN, Baidu BIDU, Intel INTC, and Apple AAPL taking interest in it.Notably, Alphabet\u2014 the most popular company in the driverless vehicle space \u2014 is continuously putting strong efforts to sustain the leading position of its self-driving unit namely Waymo, which is testified by its latest move.Waymo partnered with Transportation Research Center \u2014 the provider of independent vehicle test facility and proving grounds \u2014 in a bid to build a new advanced testing environment for Waymo Driver, its autonomous driving technology, in East Liberty, OH.Apart from this, the company is gearing up to open its research and development facility for trucking in Menlo Park, CA, early next year. This facility will also provide accommodation for the company\u2019s fleet of test vehicles.With these developments, the company plans to incorporate Waymo Driver successfully not only into cars like Jaguar I-PACE but also Class 8 trucks. This, in turn, is likely to bolster Waymo\u2019s growing initiatives being made for its autonomous truck fleet.We believe that the latest move poises Alphabet well to further capitalize on the growth prospects present in the booming self-driving space.According to a report by Grand View Research, the demand for autonomous vehicles on a global basis in 2020 is projected at 6.7 thousand units. Further, the figure is expected to witness a CAGR of 63.1% between 2021 and 2030. \u00a0 Alphabet, with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), takes the driverless technology and vehicle game to another level, intensifying the competition among the above-mentioned players who are also leaving no stone unturned to expand their presence in the autonomous driving market.Nevertheless, Waymo\u2019s aggressive stance is expected to help the company in staying ahead of the pack. Apart from the latest move, the company recently relaunched its robo-taxi ride-hailing service, with no human attendant, in Phoenix, AZ.Further, Waymo plans to start the road testing of its driverless fleet of trucks in a new hub in Dallas, TX. Notably, the company\u2019s driverless robotic Peterbilt 579 trucks will be tested initially.Furthermore, its Volvo partnership to develop self-driving electric vehicles for ride-hailing services remains a major positive.Additionally, the Latent Logic buyout remains noteworthy, which is making the simulation technology of Waymo more advanced and realistic. This, in turn, will likely strengthen the behavior prediction capability of Waymo. Alphabet on the back of its growing Waymo initiatives poses a serious challenge to Intel, Apple and Amazon.However, concerted efforts being made by these companies in the self-driving space should not be ignored.Intel is gaining on partnerships of its self-driving unit, Mobileye.Recently, Luminar Technologies teamed up with Mobileye to develop self-driving vehicles. Notably, the former\u2019s lidar will be utilized for the latter\u2019s first-generation Level 4 Mobility-as-a-Service pilot and driverless fleet.Apart from this, Mobileye is gathering steam to hit the streets of Dubai by 2022 on the heels of its multi-million dollar partnership with Al Habtoor Group. Per the terms of the deal, the Mobileye system will be deployed into a fleet of 1000 automotive robo-taxis.Further, Intel is strongly benefiting from the low power consumption of Mobileye chips and the ability to create maps for self-driving systems via its Road Experience Management platform.Amazon on the other hand agreed to acquire Zoox, a developer of self-driving technology.

The 18 companies who have signed The Climate Pledge so far are demonstrating leadership in the vital transition to a low-carbon economy that will help preserve the environment for future generations.\" Boom is redefining commercial flight by bringing supersonic travel back to the skies. Boom\u2019s historic airliner, Overture, is designed to industry-leading standards of speed, safety, and sustainability. In February 2020, the company announced that the test program for its XB-1 demonstrator will be carbon neutral, through the use of sustainable aviation fuels and high-quality, vetted carbon offsetting. Boom has also committed to making Overture a net-zero carbon aircraft in development, testing, and operation, and is a member of several organizations working to accelerate the adoption and supply of sustainable aviation fuels for the airline industry. In achieving its vision of making the world more accessible, Boom views speed and sustainability as compatible goals. \"In building the world\u2019s fastest airliner, Boom is taking an all-encompassing approach to sustainability. Having made sustainability a company priority from day one, we have been able to build best practices of environmental protection into our programs since the beginning,\" said Blake Scholl, Boom founder and CEO. \"We are thrilled to join The Climate Pledge and to ensure that speed and sustainability are compatible with one another.\" Cabify is the first and only urban mobility app in Europe and Latin America to be carbon neutral by offsetting 100% of all the carbon emissions that it generates \u2013 from its corporate operations and for every ride booked through the app. Cabify is also closely measuring and reducing emissions for its corporate activity and aiming to electrify its transportation fleet in Spain and Latin America\u2014by 2025 and 2030, respectively\u2014to reduce its carbon emissions. The company is focused on increasing environmental protections and promoting renewable energies by working on large-scale efforts in Chile, Peru and Brazil using solutions like blockchain technology for carbon offsetting. \"Efficient urban mobility is key in the fight against climate change,\" said Juan de Antonio, Cabify founder and CEO. \"Cabify wants to be part of the solution, and that\u2019s why for the third year in a row we have committed to offsetting the carbon emissions that our riders and operations generate while we continue to support the electrification of the fleets we work with. We\u2019re pleased to join The Climate Pledge to continue to be transparent about our sustainability journey.\" JetBlue is the first airline to join The Climate Pledge, and this reaffirms the company\u2019s commitment to taking measurable steps towards reducing its climate impact. In July 2020, JetBlue became the first and only U.S. airline to achieve carbon neutrality for all domestic flights. It now expects to ramp up to over 7 million metric tons of CO2 emissions offset each year\u2014the annual equivalent of removing more than 1.5 million passenger vehicles from the road. JetBlue views carbon offsetting as a bridge as the airline continues to ramp up lower-carbon technologies, such as sustainable aviation fuels, and build more fuel-efficient aircraft and operations. JetBlue began flying regularly out of San Francisco International Airport in July 2020 using a type of a sustainable aviation fuel, which enables up to an 80 percent reduction in CO2 emissions before being blended with traditional jet fuel. \"Air travel connects people and cultures, and supports a global economy. Our commitment to sustainability has become even more important as we prepare our business for a new climate reality,\" said Robin Hayes, JetBlue CEO. \"We are proud to join The Climate Pledge and join a community of like-minded organizations dedicated to reaching net zero-carbon by 2040. The climate crisis remains one of the biggest threats facing our industry. Our planet is physically changing, as are the expectations of our customers, crewmembers, and investors. Now is the time to rebuild operations in more sustainable ways, such as adopting sustainable aviation fuel and setting clear strategies to reduce net aviation CO2 emissions.\" Rivian is launching a range of adventure-oriented vehicles, as well as delivery vans specifically for Amazon last-mile delivery applications. The company\u2019s launch products, the R1T and R1S, deliver a unique combination of performance, off-road capability and utility. These vehicles use the company\u2019s flexible skateboard platform and will be produced at Rivian\u2019s manufacturing plant in Normal, Ill., with customer deliveries to begin in June 2021. \"Rivian was formed to help build the kind of future our kids and our kids\u2019 kids deserve. Rivian\u2019s commitment to sustainable vehicle production in our consumer products and commercial vans is driven by this core objective,\" said RJ Scaringe, Rivian founder and CEO. \"Addressing climate change requires individuals and entire industries to come together to create solutions that shift consumer mindsets and inspire other companies to fundamentally change the way they operate. We\u2019re excited to join The Climate Pledge community that will share knowledge, ideas, and best practices on this important mission.\" Uber has committed to become a fully zero-emission platform by 2040, with 100% of rides taking place in zero-emission vehicles, on public transit, or with micromobility options such as bikes and scooters. Uber had previously set a goal to provide 100% of rides in electric vehicles (EVs) by 2030 in U.S., Canadian, and European cities. Uber has also committed to reach net-zero emissions from its corporate operations by 2030. To reach these goals, Uber is expanding Uber Green to make it easier for riders to choose to travel in hybrids or EVs; dedicating $800 million in resources to help hundreds of thousands of drivers transition to EVs by 2025; investing in our multimodal network to provide sustainable alternatives to personal cars; and being transparent and accountable to the public along the way. \"As we announced in September, Uber is taking this moment as an opportunity to drive a green recovery from the pandemic,\" said Dara Khosrowshahi, Uber CEO. \"We invite every company in the world to join The Climate Pledge and take action to reduce their environmental impact. Together we can more aggressively tackle the urgent challenge of climate change.\" \"The Paris Agreement set out a unifying roadmap for all countries and all people to address the climate crisis by taking action,\" said Christiana Figueres, the UN\u2019s former climate change chief and Global Optimism\u2019s founding partner. \"By joining The Climate Pledge, signatories are not just making a statement of commitment to the future, they also are setting a pathway to significant actions and investments that will create jobs, spur innovation, regenerate the natural environment, and help consumers to buy more sustainable products.\" Race To Zero is a global campaign supported by The Climate Pledge to rally leadership and support from businesses, cities, regions, and investors for a healthy, resilient, zero carbon recovery.

    "article_text":"Box Co-Founder and CEO Aaron Levie joins 'Influencers with Andy Serwer' to discuss regulation of America's biggest tech companies and how President Trump's immigration policy affects business in Silicon Valley. AARON LEVIE: There is a question of, should digital platforms continue to be completely unfettered in how they work and how they operate and how they can compete, or should there be some guard rails that are meant to protect consumers as well as ensure fair competition? And I do think that it's a real risk if we don't create an environment where you can build massive companies. Then I do think that China and India will be more significant threats for us. But again, I think this is something that requires a surgical approach, as opposed to broad-based solutions like let's break up these companies. I don't think that will actually accomplish much. And I think that's more of a distraction than the underlying issue. ANDY SERWER: Do you have any idea of how the Biden administration is considering moving forward on this front, both with regard specifically to the tech companies and with regard to that relationship to China? AARON LEVIE: Well, I think, you know, from the limited interactions that I've had with parts of the team over there, the thing I'm very optimistic about is the thoughtfulness of the approaches that the Biden administration will take. I think we've been in an environment for four years where we've only had these very heavy-handed and, again, kind of blunt force types of solutions to global trade, to internet censorship, to things like immigration. And when I look at the Biden administration, already the team that has been assembled as well as just, I think, the general thoughtfulness that Biden has as well as Vise President Harris has on these issues, I think we're going to see a very, very different kind of approach, one that is much more nuanced to these topics, one that takes in more feedback and collaboration from the tech industry as well as other industries that are impacted. And I think we'll end up having, again, much better either legislation or policies that are enacted. If you just take, for example, the immigration issue that we've been facing, the Trump administration has really dealt with immigration in a very, very archaic type of fashion that doesn't really take into account the fact that America needs talent coming in from all around the world to come build amazing companies and to work at our amazing companies. And Trump has set us back many, many years in terms of being able to bring talent into this country. And that's just an example of these small decisions, seemingly, on the administration side that end up having a massive ripple effect over time, where the next Apple, the next Google, the next Facebook doesn't get created here. It gets created in China or India or another country. And that is going to set our economy back many, many years if we're not able to accelerate some of these solutions. So again, I have a lot of faith that the Biden and Harris administration will be much more effective at dealing with these issues."

    "article_text":"BlackBerry Limited BB recently inked a multi-year global agreement with Amazon Web Services, Inc. (\u201cAWS\u201d) \u2014 the cloud computing platform of Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN \u2014 for the development of a secure and intelligent connected vehicle software platform for in-vehicle applications. Dubbed BlackBerry IVY, the scalable cloud-connected software platform would seek to integrate BlackBerry QNX real-time operating system with AWS\u2019 IoT services in the cloud and in the car to develop a comprehensive edge-to-cloud offering for diversified car brands. The transformative deal, which is likely to redefine the dynamics of the automotive sector, led to one of the biggest single-day gains in its history, with the stock closing at $7.00 on Dec 1, 2020 \u2014 up 19.3%.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Each vehicle model typically includes a unique set of proprietary hardware and software components from different suppliers, which often limit developers\u2019 abilities to decipher and interact promptly with data from diverse sensors. Blackberry IVY intends to address this issue by leveraging ML techniques to generate predictive insights and provide automakers a consistent and secure way to read vehicle sensor data, driver habits and engine reliability metrics. This, in turn, will enable automakers to create responsive in-vehicle services that enhance driver and passenger experiences.While QNX software allows automotive OEMs to develop and run a common software platform across in-vehicle systems such as gateways, TCUs, engine controllers, digital cockpits and emerging domain controllers, AWS capabilities help to securely and easily access data from vehicle sensors. The vehicle data is then used to build software applications and ML models, and is deployed inside the vehicle to enable in-vehicle inference and actions that could potentially lead to less accidents in driverless vehicles.Despite running within a vehicle\u2019s embedded systems, Blackberry IVY will be managed and configured remotely from the cloud, offering automakers greater visibility and control over it. The standardized platform with integrated capabilities will facilitate automakers to share data and outputs with developers and outside technology partners without fear to deliver new features, functionality and performance-enhancing attributes. This is likely to unlock new revenue streams and business models built on vehicle data without compromising on customer privacy and security by controlling the access to vehicle and app data. It could also lead to reduced costs of maintenance and repairs by promptly identifying the first signs of potentially faulty parts and initiate corrective action. Notably, BlackBerry IVY is likely to complement and run seamlessly with new digital vehicle architectures developed by leading car manufacturers like Volkswagen AG VWAGY, General Motors Company GM and others.BlackBerry\u2019s foray into the automotive industry was marked by the seamless integration of navigation, infotainment and critical driving functions. The company leverages its extensive technology portfolio to extend the best-in-class security and reliability features. These include a unified endpoint management solution that provides comprehensive multiplatform device, application and content management with integrated security and connectivity, embedded systems, enterprise applications and related services.Operating as a leading player in the enterprise mobility management, BlackBerry is widely recognized for its productivity and security innovations. The company delivers one of the most secure end-to-end mobile enterprise solutions in the market through a broad portfolio of products and services. It offers an end-to-end software and services platform for the Enterprise of Things, which includes computers, vehicles, sensors, equipment and other connected endpoints within the enterprise that communicate with each other to enable smart business processes.The stock has gained 30.1% in the past year against a decline of 14.5% for the industry.

    "article_text":"Amazon\u2019s AMZN AWS has recently been expanding the client base, courtesy of the ever-increasing need for online services due to the COVID-19 pandemic.Recently, AWS expanded the partnership with Zoom Video Communications, Inc. ZM.Per the deal, Zoom will continue to leverage AWS\u2019 global infrastructure and other machine learning, analytics, compute, storage, content distribution, as well as security services to create a secure extension of its data centers.In addition, AWS and Zoom will develop new solutions for the latter\u2019s enterprise users to help organizations run hybrid office, as well as remote work models. In this regard, Zoom will integrate the video meeting service into select Amazon Echo Show devices. Also, it plans to incorporate Alexa for Business features into the Zoom Rooms service.Notably, Zoom has been witnessing surging demand due to the pandemic. The increasing use of its platform for various needs ranging from online education to business meetings to social gatherings to several other types of classes has led to exponential increase in Zoom users as well.To meet this unprecedented increase in demand, AWS has provided Zoom with thousands of Amazon WorkSpaces virtual desktops to help employees work remotely amid the pandemic. In addition, AWS has provided cloud infrastructure and security monitoring support to help Zoom successfully stream major events in a more secure manner.Zoom\u2019s partnership extension with AWS highlights the efficiency and reliability of AWS\u2019 innovative cloud products, as well as services. Amazon.com, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Amazon.com, Inc. Quote The recent move by Zoom is in sync with AWS\u2019 strategy of expanding clientele. In addition to this, AWS has been selected as the primary cloud provider by Itau Unibanco Holding. The latter has decided to move the majority of its IT infrastructure to AWS.Further, MercadoLibre selected AWS as its preferred long-term strategic cloud provider. Further, AWS was selected by Standard Chartered Bank. Moreover, the latter signed a five-year agreement to leverage AWS\u2019 reliable infrastructure and cloud services across the entire business in a bid to digitize operations and deliver personalized banking services across its 60 markets worldwide.We believe that expansion of customer base will continue to drive AWS\u2019 top line in the near and long term. Moreover, it will help Amazon in sustaining its dominant position in the cloud market.AWS\u2019 market share was around 32% in third-quarter 2020, per a Synergy Research Group report. Although cloud service providers like Microsoft MSFT Azure, Alphabet\u2019s GOOGL Google Cloud and Alibaba Cloud witnessed expansion in market share in the said quarter, AWS maintained its lead position. Cloud computing has been emerging as a key technology to fight the battle against the coronavirus pandemic. This technology has been witnessing higher usage globally as it allows data interoperability in a scalable, cost-efficient way by data collection, processing, analyzing and sharing across platforms.Amazon is the leading provider of cloud infrastructure as a service to enterprise customers. The expanding customer base of AWS driven by strengthening cloud offerings will continue to aid Amazon's dominance in the global cloud space.Even more encouraging is the fact that AWS generates much stronger margins than the traditional retail business, which should remain a positive for the company\u2019s profitability as it continues to grow in the mix.Currently, Amazon carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

INVESTING IN EMPLOYEES On top of Amazon\u2019s minimum $15 per hour wage, the company offers full-time employees comprehensive benefits including full medical, vision, and dental insurance as well as a 401(k) with 50 percent match starting on day one. Amazon also offers up to 20 weeks of maternal and parental paid leave and innovative benefits such as Leave Share and Ramp Back, which give new parents flexibility to support their growing families. A job at Amazon can be a springboard to an Amazon career or other opportunities. This year, Amazon promoted more than 35,000 employees in its operations network and continues to invest in the long-term career success of employees inside and outside of the company. In 2019, Amazon committed $700 million to providing 100,000 employees with access to upskilling programs through 2025. Amazon\u2019s Career Choice program is uniquely designed to upskill employees who are interested in career aspirations beyond Amazon. The program pre-pays 95% of tuition for courses in 20 high-demand fields in the U.S., including Computer Support Specialist, Web Developer, Nurse, Air Craft Mechanic, Commercial Trucker, Paralegal\/Legal Assistant, IT Security Assistant, and Network Technician among others. More than 30,000 associates have participated in Career Choice in the U.S., marking an investment of $59 million in tuition since the program started in 2012. KEEPING EMPLOYEES SAFE Amazon prioritizes the safety and health of its employees and has invested millions of dollars to provide a safe workplace. To date, the company has made over 150 significant process changes to ensure the health and safety of teams. Amazon has invested $4 billion since the first half of the year to safely deliver smiles to customers, while also protecting employees. This includes more than $800 million invested in the first half of the year on COVID-19 safety measures, with investments in personal protective equipment, enhanced cleaning of its facilities, process paths that better allow for effective social distancing, and developing its own COVID-19 testing capabilities.

    "article_text":"This commonality makes for an interesting comparison between the two. Let's take a closer look to see which can potentially drive higher investor returns in the online ad space. Most think of Amazon as an e-commerce company. Although that is an accurate assessment in many respects, it derives most of its profit from its cloud-computing segment, Amazon Web Services (AWS). Also, its move into online ads will likely evolve into a significant revenue segment over time. This has helped to give the company a market cap of about $1.6 trillion. Consequently, it actively competes with Microsoft for the title of the second-largest company trading on the market today. Image source: Getty Images. Yet despite this massive size, Amazon stock is not as expensive as it appears. Yes, its forward P\/E ratio of approximately 60 may seem high. Nonetheless, its strengths in e-commerce and cloud computing made it a solid pandemic stock. As a result, it continues to post substantial growth numbers. Admittedly, some investors may not want to buy a stock that has already risen by about 65% this year. But with the massive growth set to continue, it is hard to bet against the online giant. Facebook is an online ad giant in its own right. Its dominance of social media has allowed the company to compete with Amazon and Alphabet's Google in the lucrative online ad space. Although its approximately $780 billion market cap is less than half the size of Amazon's, it remains one of the world's largest tech companies. Moreover, like Amazon, it is not as expensive as some might assume. Its forward P\/E ratio stands at only about 25. And although COVID-19 did slow its growth in ad sales for a time, revenue growth remains in the double digits. By the third quarter, the financials had shown significant recovery. In the third quarter, revenue increased by 22% from year-ago levels. Also, earnings per diluted share surged by 28% over the same period. Moreover, the company predicts fourth-quarter revenue will rise from the previous quarter. Facebook expects holiday advertising will help drive these increases. It also believes higher sales of the Oculus Quest 2 virtual reality headset will boost revenue. However, Oculus makes up less than 2% of the company's revenue. Despite the disruption from COVID-19, Facebook stock has risen by about 32% this year. Given its recovery from the pandemic and its continuing ability to drive higher revenue, the stock should continue to march higher. Both companies are proven successes in high-growth industries. This means investors will likely profit from buying either stock. Still, despite Facebook's lower forward P\/E ratio, I have to recommend Amazon in this case. Admittedly, Amazon investors will have to pay more than double the forward valuation. Still, Amazon is dramatically surpassing its tech counterpart on profit growth. Moreover, Amazon benefits from a more diverse business. Indeed, it helped that the company's two primary revenue drivers, e-commerce and cloud computing, benefited from the pandemic. It could gain an increased advantage by potentially cutting into Facebook's ad business.\u00a0 This is somewhat troubling for Facebook as ads remain its primary revenue driver. While Oculus has shown early signs of success, it will probably remain a tiny percentage of revenue for the foreseeable future.\u00a0 For these reasons, Amazon should drive more significant returns in the near term, even when accounting for the higher valuation."

    "article_text":"Celsius' focus on fitness and energy drinks places it squarely in the fastest-growing, most profitable sector of the beverage market. In just six years since 2014, energy drinks have exploded approximately 50.5% from $9.3 billion to $14 billion annually. Market research firm Mintel Group expects sales to rise another 37.1% to $19.2 billion by 2024.  Image source: Celsius Holdings. Celsius has existed for 16 years, and its stock price remained below $6 per share for most of its history, until May 2020. Since then, its price has spiked upward twice following its second- and third-quarter earnings reports. Now, it is trading at more than $34, representing an approximately 467% jump in a six-month period. It has nearly reached the $40 price target that its most bullish analyst, Maxim Group, posted on Nov. 15, and is trading above the Wall Street consensus $30.10 target price. Celsius is clearly valued by the market as a growth stock with plenty of room to run, but can it actually deliver on the potential being priced into its current share value by investors? Its fruit-flavored energy drinks, which the company says contain \"healthy\" ingredients that are \"clinically proven to boost your metabolism and help you burn body fat,\" use proprietary formulas. That's also true for its zero-sugar, vitamin-enriched, high-caffeine Celsius Heat performance and thermogenesis drinks. But all the ingredients, such as green tea extract and L-citrulline, are well-known substances over which Celsius has no monopoly, and only the specific blend is proprietary, limiting the company's ability to differentiate itself from competitors on ingredients only. In order to continue its upward arc of growth long term, Celsius has to remain competitive in a market where giant rivals are already operating, racking up impressive growth figures of their own. Privately held Red Bull, still riding on its nearly 40-year first-mover advantage, controls 41.7% of the energy drink market, according to IRI research, and saw its sales grow 10.1% between Sept. 5, 2019, and Sept. 5, 2020.  The runner-up, Monster Beverage, holds 31% market share and generated 4.8% growth over the same period. Next to these major players, Celsius appears diminutive, despite its $2.45 billion market cap. Its market share was too small to be measurable in 2018, rose to 0.2% in 2019, and reached 0.7% by September 2020. But even if it is competing with Goliaths, Celsius doesn't need to go head-to-head against the much larger enterprises. At this point, with sales growth in the energy drink market continuing its explosive expansion, Celsius' main goal needs to be widening its distribution network -- a strategy it is executing with focus and determination. Image source: Getty Images. Additional channels that saw strong growth, and which Celsius is targeting in 2021, include drugstores, convenience stores, and international sales. Rather than being forced into being a David trying to wrest market share from the established Goliaths of its industry, Celsius can bypass the giants or even enlist them as distribution partners, because of the rising tide of energy-drink market growth. Its scorching sales growth suggests it can more than hold its own against other small, health-oriented competitors, while Monster and Red Bull continue profiting from more-traditional formulas and have little motivation to muscle in on Celsius.\u00a0 Long term, investor confidence in Celsius' ability to grow far beyond its current level will likely be vindicated, but some short-term downward corrections are possible in the meantime. Those who already have Celsius in their portfolio may want to hold some of their stock and sell some of it to await a dip in share price that creates a good reentry point. Or they can simply hold, depending on their tolerance for risk. Similarly, those thinking of buying the stock for the first time may want to do so now before it climbs higher. The alternative would be to wait out for a possible lower entry point, however that \"opportunity\" may not materialize until Celsius' stock price has climbed further, making that wait \"agonizing\". The one thing that seems very likely is that Celsius is indeed destined to climb. A popular product, good distribution strategy, and swiftly growing market will probably combine to drive its upward momentum to fizzier, more energizing heights."

    "article_text":"(Bloomberg) -- With concert venues closed, musical careers must be forged on streaming platforms instead. It\u2019s been an awful year for the majority of artists who make most of their income from gigs and touring. Yet a small but growing number are harnessing the latest tech to break through on Spotify, YouTube and TikTok. Musicians like Jayda G and RAC have bounced back from canceled tours to secure Grammy nominations with the help of apps like Distrokid, Submithub.com and fortunes.io. The tools help artists to distribute and market their work, share out royalties, break into popular playlists and identify which songs resonate most with listeners. These capabilities were long the preserve of big companies such as Vivendi SA\u2019s Universal Music Group, Sony Music Entertainment and Warner Music Group. Now technology is making it easier than ever to be a successful independent musician -- distributor AWAL said hundreds of them are now making more than $100,000 per year from streaming. Merlin, a not-for-profit that negotiates distribution rights and royalties on behalf of independent labels and rights-holders representing self-publishing musicians, accounts for around 15% of the market. The organization has seen its share of major digital music platforms grow by 3.5 percentage points during the pandemic, its Chief Executive Officer Jeremy Sirota told Bloomberg. Some 68% of independent artists have reported making more music during lockdowns, according to a survey by Midia Research. It said the number publishing their own music direct to fans grew 31% between 2019 and September this year to 4.7 million. \u201cThese artists, who tend to be earlier in their career, are playing by different rules to established artists by releasing directly themselves or doing label services deals with next-generation record labels,\u201d said Midia analyst Mark Mulligan. Here are some independent artists who are getting by, even flourishing, in the shadow of coronavirus: RAC The Portland-based musician and producer (real name Andre Allen Anjos) was on the cusp of an album tour in March when the live scene went into deep-freeze. Now he\u2019s livestreaming sessions to paying fans on Amazon.com Inc.\u2019s Twitch and using crowd-funding platform Patreon to give listeners access and bonus perks for a monthly fee. His sessions have been averaging 600,000 views a week. \u201cYou cannot play enough festivals in a week to reach that number,\u201d he said. In some ways, livestreaming has an edge over physical performance. Multiple cameras give RAC\u2019s fans an insight into his playing technique that they\u2019d never get in a live concert. \u201cI can really bring it down and have some semblance of intimacy. It feels like a new medium.\u201d Chris Webby The Connecticut rapper is having the biggest success of his career with almost 60 million streams on Apple Music and Spotify since early March. \u201cI\u2019m not saying I can pull the strings some labels can, but in theory I can operate similarly and I own my music and that is the biggest deal for me,\u201d said Webby. The key to his success is volume and consistency: By uploading a new track every other Wednesday for nine months of the year, he\u2019s managed to acquire 1.5 million monthly listeners. Webby is nostalgic for the traditional approach still loved by many musicians: the slow, careful crafting of an album that you take on tour. Now \u201cit\u2019s all about singles and algorithms,\u201d says Webby. \u201cYou have to learn that and stay on the cutting edge of these platforms.\u201d He has different agents to distribute his work via YouTube and Spotify and uses back-end apps that analyze which songs are clicking with listeners, which he uses to pick the songs for his next album. \u201cThere\u2019s one for Apple Music, another for Amazon Music, so one day I\u2019ll find a song is doing incredibly well and decide to shoot a video for it.\u201d And Webby is always mixing up his references: \u201cTwo days ago I dropped a song with a new singing approach, something like Johnny Cash, that sounds like nothing I did before.\u201d Ryan Celsius Celsius\u2019s laid-back brand of lo-fi vaporwave has caught on with stressed listeners during lockdowns. He self-releases his work and manages other musicians in the same genre including Speechless, whose monthly listens have roughly doubled since February to around 2 million, helped by the lockdown-themed song \u201cIsolation.\u201d \u201cSpeechless is constantly collaborating with different artists and labels and spreading himself out so there\u2019s no single point of failure,\u201d said Celsius. He said solo artists are also collaborating more, or starting their own labels using amuse.io, a distribution platform that manages accounting and complex royalty splits. Another, Submithub, lets musicians boost their streaming profiles by connecting with curators of the most popular playlists. Fortunes.io tells an artist when their track has been put on a Spotify or Apple playlist so they can drum up more noise for their work on social media. \u201cCovid has created a situation where everyone is almost on the same playing field -- the impact of a large artist\u2019s label on marketing is a lot smaller,\u201d said Celsius. Jayda G When lockdowns canceled her sets in Tokyo, San Francisco and Glasgow, the Canadian-born, London-based DJ ran a series of livestreamed \u201cVirtual Get Downs\u201d with donation links to raise money for the venues and local charities. The resulting social media publicity helped Spotify listens for Jayda G\u2019s latest EP surge eleven-fold, earning her second spot in the platform\u2019s largest electronic editorial playlist, mint. She used the Apple Inc.-owned music discovery app Shazam\u2019s \u201cUnlock\u201d feature, and offered exclusive behind-the-scenes video content to give fans an incentive to add her tracks to their playlists on the service. \u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P."

    "article_text":"Cloud computing is certainly not new, but the pace of the digital transformation they are creating has accelerated. One of the unexpected consequences of the coronavirus pandemic has been the rapid increase in the adoption of cloud-based solutions. Given the ease and convenience of these applications and platforms, there's almost no chance that the world will go back to business as usual. Image source: Getty Images. The ease and simplicity made it the first choice for many users. Most people loathe change, and those who have gone to the trouble of learning about video conferencing on Zoom are less likely to adopt another solution. There's also the network effect at play: The vast number of people who use Zoom makes its service all the more valuable since that's what many of people's friends and family use -- so folks aren't likely to switch. Some investors believed that the company's growth would begin to slow as the year wore on, but that simply hasn't been the case. Zoom reported second-quarter revenue that grew 355% year over year, accelerating from 169% growth in the first quarter. The number of customers with more than 10 employees soared 458%, up from 354% growth sequentially. The number of enterprise customers generating trailing-12-month revenue of $100,000 or more jumped by 112%, also accelerating from a 90% increase in the first quarter.\u00a0 Image source: Getty Images. NVIDIA's customer base is a who's who among cloud computing, including Amazon's AWS, Alphabet's Google Cloud, International Business Machines' IBM Cloud, Microsoft's Azure Cloud, and Alibaba Cloud -- to name just a few.\u00a0 Then there's the matter of how much of NVIDIA's revenue comes from cloud computing. The company's data center segment, which includes processors used in cloud computing and data centers, grew 138% year over year during the first nine months of 2020, and now accounts for 41% of NVIDIA's total revenue. During the second quarter, data center revenue surpassed gaming for the first time, but given the accelerating adoption of cloud computing, it won't be long before it's consistently NVIDIA's biggest breadwinner.\u00a0 NVIDIA was the first company to adapt its processors to the special needs of cloud computing. Parallel processing -- the ability to handle a vast number of complex mathematical calculations simultaneously, works equally well at artificial intelligence (AI) as it does at rendering images in gaming. Every cloud operator now has AI at the core of its offerings, cementing NVIDIA's advantage. This entrenched, first-mover advantage has given the company the pole position in the race to be the world's biggest cloud provider. Given NVIDIA's relentless pace of innovation, and its glowing reputation in the space, the company will be next to impossible to dislodge. Image source: Getty Images. AWS is a business that has been critically important to Amazon's success. Cloud computing accounted for just 13% of the company's revenue so far this year, but generated 71% of its profits. The reason? AWS produced juicy 31% operating margins for Amazon.\u00a0 This steady stream of profits has helped the company expand other areas of its business. It has funded Amazon's continued move into international markets, considering its bottom-line results overseas are still near breakeven. Not only that, but AWS is still growing at a remarkable pace, particularly given the size of the business. Thus far in 2020, cloud computing revenue has increased by 30% year over year, while operating income has jumped an impressive 51%. Cloud adoption will only gain steam from here. Given Amazon's massive scale, AWS will become more profitable with each passing year."

The fund does have a higher-than-average fee of 1.66%, but Korngiebel says that\u2019s because capacity is limited\u2014as a firm, Wasatch is quick to close funds. Also, researching very small companies is more intensive than digging into larger-cap firms, where information is more readily available. Last year, the Salt Lake City-based Korngiebel, 55, says, he flew more than 140,000 miles, mostly domestically, as part of the research process. He spent his career in small-cap funds. Before joining Wasatch in 2015 and becoming Micro Cap\u2019s lead portfolio manager in 2017, he worked at Columbia Management\u2014now known as Columbia Threadneedle Investments\u2014and Montibus Capital Management.\u00a0 The fund defines microcaps as firms with a market value of less than $1.5 billion, or smaller than the largest company in the Russell Microcap index. Micro Cap doesn\u2019t automatically sell holdings if they surpass the $1.5 billion threshold, which is why the fund has a higher-weighted average market cap and median market cap than its benchmark, Korngiebel says. \u201cWe are really investing with the idea of what is the company going to look like over the next five years,\u201d he says. Korngiebel divides the portfolio into two buckets: disruptive companies with a good chance of doubling in size in about three years, and firms with predictable growth rates that may double in about five years. The faster-growing firms \u201chave great economic engines,\u201d showing high profitability or a margin structure that will grow when scaled up as costs fall, he says. These firms are in big markets with innovative products and services where they can grab market share, such as apparel and home products.\u00a0 The more stable companies will still show attractive growth rates in the mid-single to low-double digits, he says. They tend to be in less cyclical markets, such as health care, and if they operate in a fragmented industry, it means less competition and potential growth through mergers and acquisitions.\u00a0 Korngiebel looks for quality companies whose market cap may increase enough to eventually be owned broadly across the Wasatch platform. He likes firms with little debt, a solid management team, and strong company culture. He has to be convinced the management team can execute the strategy, and he gets a feel for company culture through site visits. (Those are currently curtailed because of the coronavirus, but he maintains communication with companies he already knows.)\u00a0 Note: Holdings as of Sept. 30. Returns through Nov. 30; three- and five-year returns are annualized. Source: Wasatch Global Investors \u201cThere are some opportunities to recycle some of the companies that have been big winners, or the larger market caps in the portfolio with companies that are squarely microcap as well as those that may have some recovery aspect,\u201d he says.

    "article_text":"Image source: Getty Images. CVS had a decent third quarter. During this time, the company increased its revenue by 3.5% year over year, primarily due to increased sign-ups for its health insurance plans. Year to date, CVS has brought in over $12.3 billion in cash from its operations, representing a 20% increase over the first nine months of 2019.\u00a0 The COVID-19 pandemic also created several revenue opportunities for CVS. So far, the company has administered over 6 million COVID-19 tests, representing 70% of all test volume at retail locations. Additionally, the number of seasonal flu vaccines administered at CVS is up a staggering 78% year over year to 13 million.\u00a0 A major upcoming catalyst is the administration of COVID-19 vaccines at CVS locations, once one or more candidates are approved. The Trump administration's Operation Warp Speed (OWS) initiative promises to produce and deliver 300 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines before January of next year. But this is where the string of good news ends for CVS, as a significant risk now lies ahead.  More importantly, patients can save up to 80% off generic drugs and 40% on brand name medications if they do not have insurance. The discount applies to online orders as well as at over 50,000 participating pharmacies across the country. If the savings are significant, then it may incentivize patients to opt out of private-prescription drug plans.\u00a0 In addition, it is simply much more cost-effective to operate a handful of fulfillment centers for filling prescriptions than opening thousands of retail locations. Last year, CVS operated 9,941 stores at the cost of $20.522 billion each year in lease liabilities alone. That's more than three times the size of its 2019 net income of $6.634 billion.\u00a0 Its profits were tiny compared to its revenue of $256.8 billion last year. If customers were to, en masse, ditch CVS's health plans for potentially cheaper drugs or no longer go to one of their stores, then it would deal a devastating blow to the company's razor-thin margins.\u00a0 In terms of capital, CVS is pretty tied-up. With the $5.08 generated in earnings per share (EPS) last year, CVS paid $2 per share in dividends. Since many investors are holding the stock purely for the sake of dividend payments, the company can't really eliminate its payouts or put its cash to more competitive use. The company is also very severely leveraged; its debt stack stands at more than twice the amount of its $32 billion in cash and all types of investments. With over 23.3 million members in its health insurance plan, as well as filling 368.4 million prescriptions per quarter, CVS's core businesses are incredibly susceptible to Amazon's disruptions. Unfortunately, maxing out its expansion potential in the U.S. market has also caused its revenue growth to stall for some time. In fact, CVS stock is down by over 28% over the past five years. This is an abysmal performance, considering the\u00a0S&P 500 is up over 75% during the same period. "

    "url":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/softbank-winding-down-options-trading-033000810.html",
    "article_text":"(Bloomberg) -- SoftBank Group Corp. is quietly winding down its controversial derivatives strategy after a sustained backlash from investors, according to people familiar with the matter. The Japanese conglomerate is letting its options expire, instead of maintaining its positions, the people said, who declined to speak publicly. About 90% of the contracts will close out by the end of December because they are short-term, according to one of the people. SoftBank will hold on to its underlying portfolio of big tech stocks, which included Amazon.com Inc. and Facebook Inc., the person said. SoftBank shareholders balked after SoftBank\u2019s foray into derivatives trading was first disclosed in September, cutting the company\u2019s market value by as much as $17 billion. Investors have questioned the rationale of a company known for its years-long bets on technology startups dabbling in public securities, especially derivatives. They have also criticized founder Masayoshi Son for taking a personal stake in the trading. \u201cFor such a long-term investor as Mr. Son, we don\u2019t understand the attraction of short-term call-spreads,\u201d Atul Goyal, senior analyst at Jefferies, wrote in a report in November. A SoftBank spokeswoman declined to comment. The company\u2019s shares closed 0.6% lower on Wednesday in Tokyo, paring earlier losses. SoftBank has invested about $20 billion into tech stocks and derivatives through SB Northstar, in which its billionaire founder personally holds a one-third stake. Analysts and fund managers have questioned the structure of the unit, most recently on a late-evening call after an earnings announcement in November. Son defended the investment program in November as a way to put to use SoftBank\u2019s massive cash pile and has said the derivative bets are \u201ca rounding error\u201d relative to the company\u2019s assets. The fair value of SoftBank\u2019s futures and options positions came to $2.7 billion at the end of September, or just 1.2% of the $292 billion in shareholdings. The positions include long call options on listed stocks worth $4.69 billion and short call options on listed stocks with negative $1.26 billion of value. For all the controversy generated by the trading unit, SoftBank\u2019s performance has been mixed. A 292 billion yen ($2.8 billion) derivative loss in the September quarter helped all but wipe out gains in the first quarter. That left a little over $1 million in gains in the six months ended Sept. 30, a surprising result given the rally in most tech stocks. Earnings in the business are improving this quarter, one of the people said. But turning a profit on the derivatives has become increasingly difficult as the conclusion of tumultuous presidential elections in the U.S. and prospects for an effective Covid-19 vaccine reduce volatility in the markets, according to the person. SoftBank acquired about $16.2 billion of \u201chighly liquid listed stocks\u201d in the quarter ended in September, including a $6.3 billion investment in Amazon.com, $2.2 billion in Facebook and $1.8 billion in Zoom Video Communications Inc. In October, SB Northstar borrowed $6 billion, using Alibaba shares as collateral, according to its recent financial results. Son came up with the idea for the trading earlier this year when stock markets plunged with the coronavirus pandemic. Investor pressure and opposition from key lieutenants since have helped change his mind, but shuttering the program completely will take time because it has become a matter of face for the billionaire, one person said.

    "url":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/salesforce-buy-software-maker-slack-215340812.html",
    "article_text":"(Bloomberg) -- Salesforce.com Inc. agreed to buy Slack Technologies Inc. for $27.7 billion in cash and stock, giving the corporate software giant a popular workplace-communications platform in one of the biggest technology deals of the year. The transaction, Salesforce\u2019s largest-ever acquisition, is expected to close by the end of July, the San Francisco-based company said Tuesday in a statement. Slack investors will receive $26.78 for each company share as well as 0.0776 share of Salesforce -- representing a 55% premium to Slack\u2019s price on Nov. 24, the day before reports about deal talks between the companies. Salesforce Chief Executive Officer Marc Benioff has orchestrated more than 60 acquisitions in 21 years, taking his company from dot-com era upstart to a titan of cloud computing. The Slack deal would give Salesforce, the leader in programs for managing customer relationships, another angle of attack against Microsoft Corp., which has itself become a major force in internet-based computing. Microsoft\u2019s Teams product, which offers a workplace chatroom, automation tools and videoconference hosting, is a top rival to Slack. \u201cTogether, Salesforce and Slack will shape the future of enterprise software and transform the way everyone works in the all-digital, work-from-anywhere world,\u201d Benioff said in the statement. Stewart Butterfield, Slack\u2019s co-founder and CEO, will continue to run the business as a Salesforce unit when the deal is completed. He said he is excited to join the company that sparked the cloud revolution. \u201cThe opportunity we see together is massive,\u201d Butterfield said in the statement. \u201cThis is the most strategic combination in the history of software, and I can\u2019t wait to get going.\u201d Salesforce\u2019s shares declined about 4% in extended trading after closing at $241.35. The stock has jumped 48% this year. Slack\u2019s shares were little changed after closing at $43.84. The stock has almost doubled in 2020, with about half of that gain coming since the acquisition talks were reported. Salesforce, among the first of the fast-growing cloud software companies when it went public in 2004, strives to generate year-over-year revenue increases of more than 25%. Slack, which is expected to increase its sales almost 40% to $877 million this fiscal year, could help that effort. Slack, launched in 2013, went public via a direct listing in 2019. Bloomberg News and other publications reported that companies including Amazon.com Inc., Microsoft and Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google expressed interest in buying Slack at various times when it was still private. Benioff for years has turned to acquisitions to keep his product lineup fresh. He has set an annual revenue goal of $35 billion for Salesforce by fiscal 2024, compared with $17 billion in fiscal 2020. The company bought analytics firm Tableau Software Inc. in an all-stock deal valued at $15.3 billion last year, which was Salesforce\u2019s biggest acquisition at the time. The year before, in 2018, Benioff took over MuleSoft Inc. for $6.5 billion. Benioff, who just three months ago said he didn\u2019t foresee making any acquisitions given the economic environment, praised Chief Operating Officer Bret Taylor for organizing the deal with Butterfield, then pitching him on the idea. \u201cWhat\u2019s very exciting is this vision that Stewart and Bret have put together,\u201d he said in a conference call. \u201cIt\u2019s a wow.\u201d Taylor, who sold his productivity software company, Quip, to Salesforce in 2016, said Slack will be deeply integrated with the app maker\u2019s software suite to help its customers\u2019 employees. \u201cIt really is about facilitating this all-digital, work-from-anywhere world, to enable team selling, to enable people in a contact center to swarm on a case digitally whether or not you\u2019re in the same building, to enable marketers to plan a campaign,\u201d Taylor said. Separately, Salesforce projected revenue will grow about 17% in the current period to as much as $5.675 billion. That will be the slowest quarter of year-over-year sales growth in 11 years for the software maker, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Profit, excluding some items, will be 73 to 74 cents in the period ending in January, missing analysts\u2019 projections for 86 cents. Sales climbed 20% to $5.42 billion in the fiscal third quarter, which ended Oct. 31, the company said in a statement. Profit, excluding some items, was $1.74 a share, compared with analysts\u2019 average estimate of 75 cents. The company also said Chief Financial officer Mark Hawkins will retire effective Jan. 31, and be replaced by Amy Weaver, currently president and chief legal officer. Hawkins will remain an adviser through October 2021, Salesforce said. Salesforce ownership will mark a new era for Slack, a tech upstart with the lofty goal of trying to replace the need for business emails. The cloud-software giant may be able to sell Slack\u2019s chatroom product to existing customers around the world, making it even more popular. Slack said in March that it had reached 12.5 million users who were simultaneously connected on its platform, which has grown more essential while corporate employees work from home during the coronavirus pandemic. Slack has boosted revenue in the midst of Covid-19, but the company\u2019s billings have been underwhelming because of shaky demand from small and mid-sized clients. Meanwhile, use of Microsoft Teams has jumped during the pandemic, and Slack has taken issue with the company\u2019s business tactics. In July, Slack complained to the European Union that Microsoft had broken antitrust law and should be investigated. \u201cMicrosoft has illegally tied its Teams product into its market-dominant Office productivity suite, force installing it for millions, blocking its removal, and hiding the true cost to enterprise customers,\u201d Slack said in a statement at the time. Microsoft, which integrates its products with Slack, has denied any wrongdoing. While the boards of both companies approved the deal, Slack will be required to pay Salesforce $900 million if Slack\u2019s directors change their recommendation or back out to accept a \u201csuperior proposal,\u201d according to a regulatory filing. Bank of America Corp. served as Salesforce\u2019s financial adviser. Qatalyst Partners and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. advised Slack.

    "url":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/salesforce-splashy-slack-deal-isnt-221752671.html",
    "article_text":"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Salesforce.com Inc. is betting big on the staying power of remote work by buying Slack Technologies Inc. But is the splashy takeover of the workplace messaging leader worth the risk? I don\u2019t think so. Late Tuesday, Salesforce announced a definitive agreement to acquire Slack for about $28 billion in cash and stock, confirming recent reports by the Wall Street Journal and others. The value of the purchase tops Salesforce\u2019s previous largest deal, last year\u2019s $15.7 billion purchase of Tableau Software, marking founder and CEO Marc Benioff's biggest wager yet. There are legitimate reasons Salesforce may want to acquire Slack. Its software has gained in popularity and become an indispensable tool for many businesses that were forced by the coronavirus crisis to quickly adopt new technologies to maintain operations and enable their employees to work remotely. Surveys show office workers intend to keep using the software even after the pandemic subsides. However, expanding outside of Salesforce\u2019s core business could be a distraction for management. The company\u2019s best acquisitions have provided a distinct specialized solution related directly to its customer relationship management (CRM) software \u2014 technology that helps companies sell products. These include the purchase of ExactTarget\u2019s email marketing service for $2.5 billion in 2013, Demandware\u2019s e-commerce platform for $2.8 billion in 2016 and Tableau Software\u2019s data analytics last year. All of these transactions resulted in obvious synergies related to sales and marketing. Slack doesn\u2019t do any of those things. Instead, it\u2019s a software product for the common office worker. To illustrate the difference, Slack\u2019s main competitor \u2014 Microsoft Teams \u2014 is bundled inside the tech giant\u2019s suite of office productivity tools that includes Outlook, Word, Excel and PowerPoint. Slack\u2019s end user isn\u2019t quite the same as the sales manager, business analyst or marketing executive that uses Salesforce\u2019s specialized products. As a result, the integration and future cross-selling opportunities aren\u2019t as obvious as the other add-on purchases. Slack would help Salesforce compete with Microsoft on its own turf. But giving up roughly 13% percent of its market value to purchase an unprofitable company in a relatively disparate area seems inherently risky. Salesforce has tried for years to gain traction in the workplace-messaging space with its Chatter product to no avail. Its failure may speak to how different CRM software and services are, compared with general office tech tools. Investors seem to be in this skeptical camp, with the company\u2019s shares falling about 9% since deal talks were first reported last week. There are other technology companies that would make far better suitors for Slack, such as Amazon.com Inc., which already provides Slack with cloud-computing infrastructure and video-calling technology as part of a partnership. Amazon could also add the workplace-messaging product to the vast array of services Amazon Web Services offers its customers. An even better match would be Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google. Like Microsoft, Google sells a cloud-based productivity suite called Google Workspace that includes word processing, email and other applications. The Google bundle lacks a comprehensive messaging and collaboration tool that is comparable to Microsoft Teams, making Slack the perfect fit. And with Microsoft dominant in the category \u2014 it has about 270 million office workers paying for its productivity suite \u2014 a Google-Slack combination has a far better chance of increasing the level of competition in this key market. Unlike Salesforce, the revenue synergies are also clear cut: Slack\u2019s best-in-class product would make Google\u2019s productivity cloud offering a more attractive proposition. In contrast, Salesforce lacks the ability to bundle Slack with any truly complementary services, raising the danger it may wither inside the company. Neither Amazon nor Google would likely stand a chance at trying to snatch away Slack, given the rising antitrust concerns over Big Tech\u2019s power, influence and competition-squelching acquisitions. But this begs the question of why Salesforce is immune to such scrutiny. Salesforce has bought more than 60 companies since its inception and now has become a giant in its own right with a valuation of more than $200 billion. Given the risks this deal entails for Salesforce, investors may to want to root for regulators to block this deal as well.

    "article_text":"(Bloomberg) -- From Washington to Beijing, governments are trying to strike the right balance between enabling technology innovation and preventing giants like Google and Facebook Inc. from suffocating rivals. Now India is experimenting with a framework for financial technology that\u2019s certain to provide lessons worldwide -- succeed or fail. The country\u2019s unique approach is to decree limits on fintech competitors from the start: No single player can grab more than 30% of total payments transactions. Every company also has to use India\u2019s open payments platform, guaranteeing interoperability so money can be transferred between any of more than 100 traditional banks and digital services like Google Pay -- all without fees. That structure, unveiled in November, gave India\u2019s regulators the confidence to approve a new payment service from WhatsApp, the Facebook unit\u2019s initial effort to enable digital payments for more than a billion users worldwide. Although WhatsApp has more than 400 million users in India who may adopt the service, it won\u2019t be able to crush rivals like the local champion Paytm because of the government caps. \u201cIn the interest of public good, we\u2019ve disallowed a winner-take-all approach,\u201d said Dilip Asbe, chief executive officer of the National Payments Corporation of India, a coalition of set up by the country\u2019s largest retail banks to build and oversee the infrastructure. His group will stop new user registrations at a company, local or foreign, as it nears the 30% limit. India has celebrated its methodical approach as a way to get things right from the beginning, especially after Chinese regulators intervened at the last moment to derail what would have been a record initial public offering from Ant Group Co. China\u2019s digital payment services have been celebrated for their innovations and surging popularity, but the field is dominated by Ant, an affiliate of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., and Tencent Holdings Ltd. That duopoly in digital payments allowed Tencent and Ant to expand into adjacent fields like lending and wealth management, which threatened the traditional banking sector and triggered Beijing\u2019s dramatic disruption. In India, the digital payments sector is projected to grow to $1 trillion by 2023, creating a potent new platform for additional financial services. \u201cBoth countries have established themselves with best practices for others to learn from,\u201d said Arnav Gupta, analyst at Forrester Research Inc. \u201cIndia has set itself as a worthy example for digital payments but there are aspects of financial services which are yet to be streamlined and digitized.\u201d China, on the other hand, is a more mature fintech market, where its hands-off approach led to complications later. \u201cThat relaxed approach came at a cost,\u201d said Gupta. Concerns that WhatsApp could dominate payments in India stem from the enormous number of people who fire up the app to message, call and share videos -- all in 10 different Indian languages. Even street corner push-cart vendors take orders on the service. \u201cAap whatsapp mein order bhej do\u201d or \u201csend me your order via WhatsApp,\u201d is a common refrain. Google and Amazon.com Inc. also have enormous user bases in the country. The Facebook service, in pilot mode for nearly three years, got the green light to expand last month. Earlier this year, Facebook pumped $5.7 billion into Jio Platforms, a digital services business set up by Mukesh Ambani, India\u2019s richest and most influential businessman. Jio\u2019s e-commerce service would work closely with WhatsApp to help small merchants and buyers transact seamlessly, Ambani said at the time. Sending money would become as easy sending a message, Facebook\u2019s co-founder Mark Zuckerberg said after receiving the go-ahead. \u201cWe\u2019ve built it using India\u2019s Unified Payments Interface which makes it easy for anyone to accept payments across a lot of different apps,\u201d he said said in a video message.India mandates that companies use its UPI platform so payments can be sent among all services, including those from Facebook, Amazon, Walmart Inc., Paytm and any new upstart. Zero user fees are also required. \u201cThat will increase the competitive intensity in payments,\u201d said Nandan Nilekani, the architect of India\u2019s biometric identity system on which the payments infrastructure is built. \u201cIndia is showing the way by mandating zero-fee at the front end and bringing the rigor of risk management at the back end.\u201d India is already the world\u2019s second-largest internet base, after China, with a half a billion users and its growth is drawing global players like Facebook and Amazon. The coronavirus pandemic is accelerating the move to e-commerce and other online services. The number of digital payment transactions is projected to grow 15-fold over the next two to three years to about a billion a day, said Asbe of the National Payments Corporation of India.His organization is still discussing the final mechanisms for capping the market share of various players. \u201cWe will work out details in a few months after industry consultations,\u201d said Asbe. \u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P."

    "article_text":"Etsy stock has lodged a massive rebound and year-to-date gain. But its breakouts have been tenuous, and investors who bought its current move are watching closely to see whether it will make good on its three-day old breakout. Etsy received a double benefit from the coronavirus and the locked-down economy that created. First, entrepreneurs driving the marketplace recognized the demand for uniquely designed masks. As a result, Etsy reported $346 million in mask sales during the second quarter. Overall sales soared 137%, far above the average of less than 35% growth over the prior four quarters. Earnings also rocketed, reversing from three quarters of double-digit declines to a 436% advance in Q2 and a gain of 483% in Q3. Alongside the stellar sales and earnings performance, Etsy stock rebounded aggressively following its one-month correction in March. It's interesting to note that the rebound \u2014 370% off its March low through an August high \u2014 had not offered a real buy point until a breakout in early October. The stock broke out from a second cup base pattern on Friday. As shares held narrowly above the buy point on Tuesday, investors waited to see whether the e-crafts giant would make good on this breakout, or follow the same failed trajectory as it did in October. But let's back up and take a look at Etsy's stock-price history. In Etsy's first 12 months after going public in April 2015, shares dropped 45%. For all of 2016, the stock gained 43%, followed by a 74% gain in 2017 and a 133% advance in 2018. In 2019, shares took a breather, backing off 7% for the whole year. After the six-month, 370% rebound off its March low, Etsy started building bases in August. A breakout from an eight-week cup failed in early October. Its next base was less patient \u2014 31 days long. That means a weekly chart didn't show it at a full six weeks long, the minimum necessary for a pattern deeper than a 15% flat base. But on a daily chart, the 31 days are just a bit longer than six five-day trading weeks. That equals a cup base. In this case, the pattern offered a buy point at 154.98. Etsy stock traded less than 2% above that entry on Tuesday, in a buy range that runs to 162.73. Analysts call for Etsy to report a 128% earnings gain in the current quarter, and a 180% gain for the year. But 2021 will be the real question, with the potential for a dying-down of pandemic economic trends, and a return to something like normalcy. Investors have projected a cautious 2% earnings gain for Etsy for the year. YOU MAY ALSO LIKE:"

Curbside pickup on Cyber Monday jumped 30% versus last year. \"Throughout the remainder of the holiday season, we expect to see record sales continue and curbside pickup to gain even more momentum as shoppers avoid crowds and potential shipping delays,\" said Taylor Schreiner, a director at Adobe Digital Insights. Not all the news was good. Digital sales fell short of Adobe's initial forecast of $12.7 billion. The prediction had been revised lower in recent days, as it became clear that holiday shopping began much earlier in 2020 than in previous years. As a result, Adobe trimmed its digital sales forecast for this year's holiday season to $184 billion, up roughly 30% compared with last year. That's down from its original forecast of $189 billion."

    "article_text":"(Bloomberg) -- Amazon.com Inc. is laying the groundwork for a quantum computer, deepening efforts to harness technology that can crunch in seconds vast amounts of data that take even the most powerful supercomputers hours or days to process. Amazon has been hiring for a Quantum Hardware Team within its Amazon Web Services Center for Quantum Computing, according to internal job postings and information on LinkedIn. Marc Runyan, a former engineer with NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, lists his title on the professional social network as senior quantum research scientist at Amazon and describes his role as \u201chelping to design and build a quantum computer for Amazon Web Services.\u201d A spokesman for Amazon Web Services, the company\u2019s cloud-computing group, declined to comment. Runyan didn\u2019t immediately respond to a LinkedIn message. Proponents of quantum computing say the technology will exponentially improve the processing speed and power of computers, enabling them to simulate large systems and drive advances in physics, chemistry and other fields. Rather than storing information in binary 0s or 1s like classical computers, quantum computers rely on \u201cqubits\u201d, which can be both 0 and 1 simultaneously, dramatically increasing the amount of information that can be encoded. The technology is in its infancy and largely limited to prototypes and demonstrations. Scientists say practical, widespread applications for quantum computers are likely years away. Read More: Why Quantum Computers Will Be Super Awesome, Someday: QuickTake Among Amazon\u2019s recent hires are research scientists focusing on designing a new superconducting quantum device as well as device fabrication. Developing its own quantum computer would let Amazon more closely mirror the approach taken by its major cloud rivals. International Business Machines Corp. first made a quantum computer available to the public in 2016 and has rolled out regular upgrades. Last year, Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google said it had built a computer that\u2019s reached \u201cquantum supremacy,\u201d performing a computation in 200 seconds that would take the fastest supercomputers about 10,000 years. But with the rivalrous spirit that has characterized the race to build a quantum computer, IBM cast doubt on Google\u2019s claim. In a blog post, it said that a simulation of Google\u2019s task could be done in 2.5 days on a conventional computer with enough hard drive storage, not 10,000 years. Amazon announced its entry into the arena last year and, in August, launched its first quantum computing service, called Braket, which helps cloud clients experiment with quantum algorithms run on AWS. Once they\u2019ve designed their algorithms, clients can choose to run them on quantum processing systems built by other companies, including D-Wave Systems Inc., IonQ Inc., and Rigetti Computing. At the time, Amazon noted its interest in developing hardware, but stopped short of announcing plans to build its own computer. One person briefed on Amazon\u2019s plans, but not authorized to discuss them, says the company is using a superconductor model, a similar approach to that used by Google and IBM, among others. The person said Amazon has been on a hiring spree to staff its quantum computing group. Last year Amazon announced the launch of the AWS Center for Quantum Computing, which aimed to bring together researchers from Amazon, the California Institute of Technology and other academic research institutions to develop new quantum computing technologies. \u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P."

    "article_text":"As AWS CEO Andy Jassy says, an experienced engineer will know when equipment is breaking down by a certain change in sound or a vibration, but if the machine could tell you even before it got that far, it would be a huge boost to these teams. \"...a lot of companies either don't have sensors, they're not modern powerful sensors, or they are not consistent and they don't know how to take that data from the sensors and send it to the cloud, and they don't know how to build machine learning models, and our manufacturing companies we work with are asking [us] just solve this [and] build an end-to-end solution. So I'm excited to announce today the launch of Amazon Monotron, which is an end-to-end solution for equipment monitoring,\" Jassy said. The company builds a machine learning model that understands what a normal state looks like, then uses that information to find anomalies and send back to the team in a mobile app information about equipment that needs maintenance now based on the data the model is seeing. Amazon has something for those companies that may have a more modern system and don't need the complete package that Monotron offers. If you have modern sensors, but you don't have a sophisticated machine learning model, Amazon can ingest this data and apply its machine learning algorithms to find anomalies just as it can with Monotron. \"So we have something for this group of customers as well to announce today, which is the launch of Amazon Lookout for Equipment, which does anomaly detection for industrial machinery,\" he said. In addition, the company announced the Panorama Appliance for companies using cameras at the edge that want to use more sophisticated computer vision, but might not have the most modern equipment to do that. \"I'm excited to announce today the launch of the AWS Panorama Appliance, which is a new hardware appliance [that allows] organizations to add computer vision to existing on premises smart cameras,\" Jassy told AWS re:Invent today. In addition, it also announced a Panorama SDK to help hardware vendors build smarter cameras based on Panorama.

    "article_text":"AQUA (Advanced Query Accelerator) for Amazon Redshift provides an innovative new hardware-accelerated cache that delivers up to 10x better query performance than any other cloud data warehouse  AWS Glue Elastic Views lets developers easily build materialized views that automatically combine and replicate data across multiple data stores Amazon QuickSight Q is a machine learning-powered capability for Amazon QuickSight that lets users type questions about their business data in natural language and receive highly accurate answers in seconds Capital One, Best Western Hotels & Resorts, NTT DOCOMO, Audible, and Panasonic Avionics among customers using new analytics capabilities  Today at AWS re:Invent, Amazon Web Services, Inc. (AWS), an Amazon.com, Inc. company (NASDAQ: AMZN), announced three new analytics capabilities that dramatically improve the performance of Amazon Redshift data warehouses, make it significantly easier for customers to move and combine data across data stores, and make it much simpler for end-users to get more value from their business data using machine learning. AQUA for Amazon Redshift accelerates querying with an innovative new hardware-accelerated cache that brings the compute to the storage and delivers up to 10x better query performance than any other cloud data warehouse, with general availability coming in January 2021. AWS Glue Elastic Views helps developers build applications that use data from multiple data stores with materialized views that automatically combine and replicate data across storage, data warehouses, and databases. Amazon QuickSight Q delivers a machine learning-powered capability for Amazon QuickSight that gives users the ability to use natural language expressions to ask business questions in the Amazon QuickSight Q search bar and receive highly accurate answers in seconds. \"With the capabilities we're announcing today, we're delivering an order-of-magnitude performance improvement for Amazon Redshift, new flexible ways to more easily move data between data stores, and the ability for customers to ask natural language questions in their business dashboards and receive answers in seconds,\" said Rahul Pathak, VP, Analytics, AWS. \"These capabilities will meaningfully change the speed and ease of use with which customers can get value from their data at any scale.\" AQUA (Advanced Query Accelerator) for Amazon Redshift brings compute to the storage layer, delivering up to 10x faster query performance than any other cloud data warehouse  Since its launch in 2012 as the first data warehouse built for the cloud at a cost of 1\/10th that of traditional data warehouses, Amazon Redshift has become the most popular cloud data warehouse. Earlier this year, AWS announced the general availability of Amazon Redshift RA3 instances, which allow customers to scale compute and storage separately and deliver up to 3x better performance than any other cloud data warehouse. However, even with the advantages offered by RA3 instances, the rapid growth of data that customers need to process in their data warehouses has led to a difficult balancing act between performance and cost-effective scaling. The prevailing approach to data warehousing has been to build out an architecture whereby large amounts of centralized storage are moved to waiting compute nodes to process the data. The challenge with this approach is that there is a lot of data movement between the shared data and compute nodes. As data volumes continue to grow at a rapid clip, this data movement saturates available networking bandwidth and slows down performance. In addition to the networking bottleneck, CPUs are not able to keep up with the faster growth in storage capabilities (SSD storage throughput has grown 6x faster than the ability of CPUs to process data from memory), which either creates a new CPU bottleneck of its own or forces more customers to over-provision compute to get their work done more quickly. AWS Glue Elastic Views lets developers easily build materialized views that automatically combine and replicate data across multiple data stores  Most companies are building or have already built data lakes, where they can aggregate all of the data from various silos with the right security and access controls, to make it easier to do analytics and machine learning. But for latency and operational reasons, most companies are also likely to have increasing amounts of data in purpose-built data stores outside of their data lakes. As the data in these data lakes and purpose-built data stores continue to grow, companies need an easier way to move data around. Amazon QuickSight Q is a machine learning-powered capability for Amazon QuickSight that lets users type natural language questions about their business data and receive highly accurate answers in seconds Amazon QuickSight is a scalable, serverless, embeddable machine learning-powered business intelligence (BI) service built for the cloud. Amazon QuickSight provides all the benefits of a modern, interactive, self-service BI solution with capabilities that make it easy to embed dashboards in applications and cost-effectively scale to support thousands of customers. Amazon QuickSight's \u2018Auto-Narratives\u2019 feature provides customers with an automatically generated summary in plain language that interprets and describes what the data in a BI dashboard means, so all users have a shared understanding of the data. Customers like these human-readable narratives because it enables them to quickly interpret the data in a shared dashboard and focus on the insights that matter most. Customers have also been interested in asking business questions of their data in plain language and receiving answers in near real-time. While some BI tools and vendors have attempted to solve this challenge with Natural Language Query (NLQ), the existing approaches require that customers first spend months in advance preparing and building a model, and even then, they still have no way of asking questions that require new calculations that are not pre-defined in the data model. For example, the question, \"What is our year-over-year growth rate?\" requires that \u2018growth rate\u2019 be pre-defined as a calculation in the model. With today\u2019s BI tools, users need to work with their BI teams to update the model to account for any new calculation or data, which can take days or weeks of effort. Tokyo-based NTT DOCOMO is the largest mobile service provider in Japan, serving more than 80 million customers. \"Since migrating to Amazon Redshift in 2014, Amazon Redshift has been the center of our analytics environment and has allowed us to scale to over ten petabytes of uncompressed data with a 10x performance improvement over our prior on-premises system,\" said Ken Ohta, General Manager of Service Innovation Department, NTT DOCOMO. \"As customer demand for data and data volumes grow, continuous innovation from Amazon Redshift has helped us with the flexibility and ease of use needed to scale our systems. We are excited about the launch of AQUA for Amazon Redshift as we continue to increase the performance and scale of our Amazon Redshift data warehouse.\" Intercom is a fast-growing startup with a $1.3 billion valuation and over $240 million in funding. \"Strong customer relationships are more important than ever, but the scale and nature of online business can make it hard to create personal connections. That\u2019s why we created the world\u2019s first Conversational Relationship Platform to help businesses build better customer relationships through personalized, messenger-based experiences. To make this work well, and understand our business as it explodes, we rely on an enormous amount of data\u201470 terabytes and growing,\" said Paul Vickers, Data Engineering Manager, Intercom. \"Our Amazon Redshift cloud data warehouse has made it easy to scale and stay on budget. We\u2019re excited about the new AQUA capabilities in Amazon Redshift which will accelerate our queries and reduce our analysts\u2019 time to insights. We know with AWS we can focus on our growth, without worrying about how technology will support it.\" Accenture is a global professional services company with leading capabilities in digital, cloud and security. \"At Accenture we are committed to providing services and solutions that help customers around the world use data for real-time decision making. However, as data and the demand for insight grows at an incredible pace, it can be challenging to define, prioritize, and process the data,\" said A.K. Radhakrishnan, North American Data & AI AWS Lead, Accenture. \"AQUA for Amazon Redshift provides an innovative new way to approach data warehousing with up to 10x faster query performance. This makes it easier for us to support the goal of a data-driven enterprise.\" ZS Associates is a professional services firm that works side-by-side with companies to help develop and deliver products that drive customer value and company results. \"AWS has always been at the forefront of innovation and is known for bringing best-in-class solutions to help its customers.

These commercial databases offer high performance and advanced availability features, but are expensive, complex to manage, and have high lock-in. Moreover, customers that are self-managing commercial databases are often at the mercy of old-guard database vendors and the brazen tricks they play, such as imposing arbitrary and punitive licensing terms. Today, more than a hundred thousand customers are choosing to run their database workloads on Amazon Aurora because it delivers the performance and availability of the highest-grade commercial databases at one tenth of the cost, making it the fastest-growing service in AWS history. In total, more than 350,000 databases have been migrated to AWS using AWS Database Migration Service (DMS). Today\u2019s announcements build upon this momentum by delivering the next generation of Amazon Aurora Serverless, as well as a capability to run SQL Server workloads on Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL, and an open source project that makes it even easier for more organizations to migrate from SQL Server to PostgreSQL. Amazon Aurora Serverless v2 scales database workloads to hundreds of thousands of transactions in a fraction of a second, saving customers up to 90% compared to provisioning for peak capacityCustomers often face a dilemma when managing database capacity. If they over-provision capacity, they end up spending more money than necessary, but if they under-provision capacity, they risk application downtime. Since its launch in 2018, Amazon Aurora Serverless has been used by tens of thousands of customers as a cost-effective database option for applications that have infrequent, intermittent, or unpredictable traffic (e.g. test and development workloads). V1 of Amazon Aurora Serverless scales database capacity within five to 50 seconds by doubling capacity each time it is needed; and because it is serverless, customers don\u2019t have to worry about managing database capacity. However, in order to run more production workloads in Aurora Serverless, customers need capacity to scale instantly and in more precise increments, and also want to take advantage of the full range of capabilities in Amazon Aurora, including using multiple AWS Availability Zones (AZs) for high availability, Global Database for low latency, Read Replicas for high performance, Backtrack for high resiliency, and Parallel Query for faster querying. Babelfish for Aurora PostgreSQL gives organizations the ability to run SQL Server applications directly on Amazon Aurora with little to no code changesAutodesk, Best Western Hotels & Resorts, Dow Jones, Honda, Liberty Mutual Insurance Company, Samsung Electronics, Reddit, Venmo, and Verizon Communications are some of the customers who have successfully migrated over 350,000 databases to AWS using AWS DMS to migrate their data with minimal downtime and AWS Schema Conversion Tool (SCT) to migrate their database schema. However, once the initial database migration is complete, customers also have the onerous task of migrating their application logic. Migrating application logic requires manual coding, is time consuming, and is often tied to proprietary database commands from the old-guard database providers. As Microsoft has gotten increasingly more aggressive and manipulative with its licensing practices, customers have asked AWS to make it easier to migrate their SQL Server applications to Amazon Aurora. \"Customers have told us that they\u2019re frustrated and fed up with the brazen tactics of the old-guard database vendors, when what they want to do is focus on growing their businesses. These customers want to move to open source, built-for-the-cloud databases for their simplicity and cost-effectiveness, without compromising on availability, reliability, and security,\" said Shawn Bice, Vice President, Databases, AWS. \"With today\u2019s announcement of the next generation of Amazon Aurora Serverless and Babelfish, we are making it even easier for customers to leave the constraints of old-guard databases behind, enjoy the immense cost advantages of open source database engines, and choose the right database for the right job.\" Venmo has been the app for fast, safe, social payments between friends since 2009, and is owned by PayPal, a global leader in digital payments. \"At Venmo, we use Amazon Aurora to process tens of millions of transactions per day, but the volume of transactions fluctuates depending on the day and time of year,\" said Nick Ciubotariu, Chief Technology Officer, Venmo. \"Amazon Aurora Serverless v2 could help us ensure we don\u2019t over or under-provision Amazon Aurora, enabling us to continue providing a great user experience for our customers while only paying for just the database capacity we need at any given time.\" Zendesk builds software for better customer relationships and empowers organizations to improve customer engagement and better understand their customers. \"At Zendesk, we rely on Amazon Aurora to support over 150,000 different customers and their data,\" said Kalyan Wunnava, Director of Engineering, Zendesk. \"We are looking forward to Amazon Aurora Serverless v2, which has the potential to significantly simplify management of our fleet of Amazon Aurora instances, while continuing to provide the level of high performance our customers expect.\" WirelessCar is the world-leading provider of digital automotive services that enable the development of software-defined, electrical, and self-driving cars that will take us to the future of safe, smart and sustainable mobility. \"We are embracing serverless architectures on AWS to be able to focus our efforts on customer value and business processes instead of worrying about the management of compute infrastructure,\" said Niklas Flor\u00e9n, Senior Vice President, CTO & COO, WirelessCar. \"We are eager to extend these serverless architectures to our relational databases through Amazon Aurora Serverless v2 and operate database workloads worry-free while using all the rich functionality offered by Amazon Aurora.\" Acquia, a SaaS provider of web content management solutions, relies on Amazon Aurora to support many of its relational database workloads. \"Thanks to Amazon Aurora, Acquia has improved throughput by 30%, eliminated database downtime, and considerably reduced our infrastructure and operational maintenance overhead,\" said Jake Farrell, Senior Director of Engineering, Acquia. \"We are extremely excited about the new version of Amazon Aurora Serverless.

(AWS), an Amazon.com company (NASDAQ: AMZN), announced four storage innovations that deliver added storage performance, resiliency, and value to customers, including: Amazon EBS io2 Block Express volumes: Next-generation storage server architecture delivers the first SAN built for the cloud, with up to 256,000 IOPS, 4,000 MB\/second throughput, and 64 TB of capacity (a 4x increase across all metrics compared to standard io2 volumes), to meet the performance requirements of the most I\/O intensive business critical applications (available in preview). Amazon EBS Gp3 volumes: Next-generation general purpose SSD volumes for Amazon EBS give customers the flexibility to provision additional IOPS and throughput without needing to add additional storage, while also offering higher baseline performance of 3,000 IOPS and 125 MB\/second of throughput with the ability to provision up to 16,000 IOPS and 1,000 MB\/second peak throughput (a 4x increase over Gp2 volumes) at a 20% lower price per GB of storage than existing Gp2 volumes (available today). Amazon S3 Intelligent-Tiering automatic data archiving: Two new tiers (Archive Access and Deep Archive Access) help customers further reduce their storage costs by up to 95% for objects rarely accessed by automatically moving unused objects into archive access tiers (available today). Amazon S3 Replication (multi-destination): New capability gives customers the ability to replicate data to multiple S3 buckets in the same or different AWS Regions, in order to better manage content distribution, compliance, and data-sharing needs across Regions (available today). EBS io2 Block Express volumes deliver the first SAN built for the cloudCustomers choose io2 volumes (the latest generation-provisioned IOPS volumes) to run their critical, performance-intensive applications like SAP HANA, Microsoft SQL Server, IBM DB2, MySQL, PostgresSQL, and Oracle databases because it provides 99.999% (five 9s) of durability and 4x more IOPS than general purpose EBS volumes. Some applications require higher IOPS, throughput, or capacity than offered by a single io2 volume. To address the needed performance, customers often stripe multiple io2 volumes together. However, the most demanding applications require more io2 volumes to be striped together than customers want to manage. For these highly demanding applications, many customers have historically used on-premises SANs (a set of disks accessed over the local network). However, SANs have numerous drawbacks. They are expensive due to high upfront acquisition costs, require complex forecasting to ensure sufficient capacity, are complicated and hard to manage, and consume valuable data center space and networking capacity. When a customer exceeds the capacity of a SAN, they have to buy another entire SAN, which is expensive and forces customers to pay for unused capacity. Customers told us they wanted the power of a SAN, but in the cloud, which hasn\u2019t existed \u2013 until now. EBS Block Express is a completely new storage architecture that gives customers the first SAN built for the cloud. EBS Block Express is designed for the largest, most I\/O intensive mission-critical deployments of Oracle, SAP HANA, Microsoft SQL Server, and SAS Analytics that benefit from high-volume IOPS, high throughput, high durability, high storage capacity, and low latency. With io2 volumes running on Block Express, a single io2 volume can now be provisioned with up to 256,000 IOPS, drive up to 4,000 MB\/second of throughput, and offer 64 TB of capacity \u2013 a 4x increase over existing io2 volumes across all parameters. Additionally, with io2 Block Express volumes, customers can achieve consistent sub-millisecond latency for their latency-sensitive applications. Customers can also stripe multiple io2 Block Express volumes together to get even better performance than a single volume can provide. Block Express helps io2 volumes achieve this performance by completely reinventing the underlying EBS hardware, software, and networking stacks. By decoupling the compute from the storage at the hardware layer and rewriting the software to take advantage of this decoupling, EBS Block Express enables new levels of performance and reduces time to innovation. By also rewriting the networking stack to take advantage of the high-performance Scalable Reliable Datagrams (SRD) networking protocol, Block Express dramatically reduces latency. These improvements are available to customers with no upfront commitments to use io2 Block Express volumes, and customers can provision and scale capacity without the upfront costs of a SAN. EBS Gp3 volumes decouple IOPS from storage capacity, deliver more performance, and are priced 20% lower than previous generation volumesCustomers use EBS volumes to support a broad range of workloads, such as relational and non-relational databases (e.g. Microsoft SQL Server and Oracle), enterprise applications, containerized applications, big data analytics engines, distributed file systems, virtual desktops, dev\/test environments, and media workflows. Gp2 volumes have made it easy and cost effective for customers to meet their IOPS and throughput requirements for many of these workloads, but some applications require more IOPS than a single Gp2 volume can deliver. With Gp2 volumes, performance scales up with storage capacity, so customers can get higher IOPS and throughput for their applications by provisioning a larger storage volume size. However, some applications require higher performance, but do not need higher storage capacity (e.g. databases like MySQL and Cassandra). These customers can end up paying for more storage than they need to get the required IOPS performance. Customers who are running these workloads want to meet their performance needs without having to provision and pay for a larger storage volume. Amazon S3 Intelligent-Tiering adds two new archive tiers that deliver up to 95% storage cost savingsThe S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class automatically optimizes customers\u2019 storage costs for data with unknown or changing access patterns. It is the first and only cloud storage solution to provide dynamic pricing automatically based on the changing access patterns of individual objects in storage. S3 Intelligent-Tiering has been widely adopted by customers with data sets that have varying access patterns (e.g. data lakes) or unknown storage access patterns (e.g. newly-launched applications). S3 Intelligent-Tiering charges for storage in two pricing tiers: one tier for frequent access (for real-time data querying) and a cost-optimized tier for infrequent access (for batch querying). However, many AWS customers have storage that they very rarely access and use S3 Glacier or S3 Glacier Deep Archive to reduce their storage costs for this archived data. Prior to today, customers needed to manually build their own applications to monitor and record access to individual objects, when determining which objects were rarely accessed and needed to be moved to archive. Then, they needed to manually move them. Amazon S3 Replication extends the ability to replicate data to multiple destinations within the same AWS Region or across different AWS RegionsCustomers use S3 Replication today to create a replica copy of their data within the same AWS Region or across different AWS Regions for compliance requirements, low-latency performance, or data sharing across accounts. Some customers also need to replicate the actual data to multiple destinations (S3 buckets in the same AWS Region or S3 buckets in multiple Regions) to meet data sovereignty requirements, to support collaboration between geographically-distributed teams, or to maintain the same data sets in multiple AWS Regions for resiliency. To accomplish this today, customers must build their own multi-destination replication service by monitoring S3 events to identify any newly-created objects. They then spread out these events into multiple queues, invoke AWS Lambda functions to copy objects to each destination S3 bucket, track the status of each API call, and aggregate the results. Customers also need to monitor and maintain these systems, which create added expense and operational overhead. \"More data will be created in the next three years than was created over the past 30 years,\" said Mai-Lan Tomsen Bukovec, Vice President, Storage, at AWS. \"The cloud is a big part of why developers and companies are generating and retaining so much data, and data storage is in need of reinvention. Today\u2019s announcements reinvent storage by building a new SAN for the cloud, automatically tiering customers\u2019 vast troves of data so they can save money on what\u2019s not being accessed often, and making it simple to replicate data and move it around the world as needed to enable customers to manage this new normal more effectively.\" Teradata is the cloud data analytics platform company, solving the world\u2019s most complex data challenges at scale. \"When your focus is analyzing the world\u2019s data in real-time, having the right balance of price and performance is critical\u2014for our business and our end-customers,\" said Dan Spurling, SVP Engineering, Teradata. \"With the release of Gp3, Teradata AWS customers will experience improved performance and throughput, allowing them to drive increased analytics at scale. With the significant improvements in Gp3 over Gp2, we expect 4x higher throughput with fewer EBS volumes per instance; enabling our customers to receive increased performance and improved instance level availability.\" Embark is building self-driving truck technology to make roads safer and transportation more efficient. \"We use S3 Intelligent-Tiering to store logs from our fleet of self-driving trucks. These logs contain petabytes of data from the sensors on our vehicle such as cameras and LiDARS, while also storing control signals, and system logs that we need to perfectly reconstruct everything that happened on and around our vehicles at any point in time. Keeping all of this data is critical to our business,\" said Paul Ashbourne, Head of Infrastructure, Embark. \"Our teams frequently access recently-collected data for their analyses, but over time, most of this data gets colder and subsets of data are not accessed for months at a time. It\u2019s important that we continue to save older data in case we need to analyze it again, but doing so can be costly. S3 Intelligent-Tiering is perfect for us because it automatically optimizes our storage costs based on individual object access patterns. With the two new Archive Access tiers, we save even more when our fleet log data is rarely accessed. All of this happens seamlessly without our engineering team having to build or manage any custom storage monitoring systems. With S3 Intelligent-Tiering, everything just works, and we can focus less time managing our storage and more time on research and development.\" Zalando is Europe\u2019s leading online platform for fashion and lifestyle with over 35 million active customers. \"We built a 15 PB data lake on Amazon S3 which has allowed employees to act on and analyze historical sales and web tracking data that they previously wouldn\u2019t have had access to,\" said Max Schultze, Lead Data Engineer, Zalando. \"By using S3 Intelligent-Tiering, we were able to save 37% of our yearly storage costs for our data lake, as it automatically moved objects between a Frequent Access and Infrequent Access tier. We are looking forward to the new S3 Intelligent-Tiering Archive Access tiers to save even more on objects that are not accessed for long periods of time.\" SmugMug+Flickr is the world's largest and most influential photographer-centric platform. \"We're new to S3 Replication and have used Amazon S3 since day one. S3 Replication for multiple destinations delivers awesome options for our global data handling,\" said Andrew Shieh, Director of Engineering\/Operations, at SmugMug+Flickr. \"We can now leverage S3 Replication in new ways, planning optimized replication strategies using our existing S3 Object tags. S3 Replication support for multiple destinations handles the heavy lifting, so we can spend more of our operational and development time thrilling our customers. Our petabytes of data in S3, fully managed by a few lines of code, are at the heart of our business. These continual improvements to S3 keep SmugMug and Flickr growing together with our partners at AWS.\" About Amazon Web Services About Amazon Contacts"

    "article_text":"Amazon ECS Anywhere enables customers to run Amazon ECS in their own data centers  Amazon EKS Anywhere provides customers the ability to run Amazon EKS in their own data centers AWS Proton provides customers with a new service to automate container and serverless application development and deployment Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR) Public provides developers an easy and highly-available way to share and deploy container software publicly Today at AWS re:Invent, Amazon Web Services, Inc. (AWS), an Amazon.com company (NASDAQ: AMZN), announced four new container innovations to help customers develop, deploy, and scale modern applications. Containers provide a standard way for developers to package and run applications quickly and reliably in any environment, while also improving resource utilization and reducing cost. AWS is now making it even easier to provision, deploy, and manage container applications. It is doing this by enabling customers to run Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) or Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) in their own data centers, adding a new service for automated container and serverless application development and deployment, and providing a new container registry that gives developers an easy and highly available way to share and deploy container software publicly. Most companies offer customers a single managed Kubernetes container offering. This is limiting because different developers prioritize different needs. For developers who most prioritize using the open source Kubernetes orchestration engine, AWS offers Amazon EKS. For developers who most prioritize the deepest integration with the rest of AWS and the comfort of AWS-style APIs and streamlined configurations for cluster management, scheduling, and monitoring, AWS offers Amazon ECS. And, for those customers who prefer to run containers without having to think about servers or clusters at all (i.e. serverless), AWS offers AWS Fargate. No other provider has either a serverless container offering or this selection of container offerings overall to meet the diverse needs of developers. All three of these services continue to grow at a rapid rate, and often, customers use all three container services at the same time for different workloads. Amazon ECS Anywhere and Amazon EKS Anywhere enable customers to run Amazon ECS and Amazon EKS in their own data centers Today, customers that want to run their applications in containers have to deal with different deployment and management processes for on-premises applications and cloud applications. In these cases, customers have to manually install, operate, and manage container orchestration software on-premises. Because these customers have to use disparate tooling across their AWS and on-premises environments, they also have to stay current with multiple specialized knowledge domains and skillsets. This situation not only leads to operational overhead, but it also slows down the pace of delivering new business capabilities. What customers want instead is a fully-managed solution that works in their own data centers and in AWS with the same monitoring, cluster management, and deployment pipelines they use in Amazon ECS and Amazon EKS today. AWS Proton provides developers with a new service to automate container and serverless application development and deployment Container and serverless applications provide obvious operational benefits, but they also change the way customers develop and deploy their code. Today, when developers build traditional applications on Amazon EC2 instances, the applications are often built as a single block of code, and there are well-established tools that help them develop and deploy their code like AWS CloudFormation templates (to provision the infrastructure), AWS CodePipeline (to set up the CI\/CD process), and Amazon CloudWatch (to monitor the deployments). In reality, once customers get an application up and running on EC2, the components of the application don\u2019t change very much. Typically, the code is maintained in a single release, so keeping it coordinated is relatively easy. By contrast, container and serverless applications are assembled from smaller chunks of code that are often developed and maintained independently and then stitched together to build and scale an application. Each chunk of code has its own separate infrastructure that has to be updated and maintained. Often, these smaller pieces of code are developed and operated by different teams, so those teams have the freedom to update the components at their own pace. This results in changes happening more frequently than with traditional applications. As customers have naturally gravitated to container and serverless application development, they\u2019ve also found that trying to coordinate all of the changes across their infrastructure provisioning, code deployments, and monitoring tools can be a challenge. Customers lack an integrated solution that ties together all the tasks, including resource provisioning, code deployments, and monitoring. Central infrastructure teams try to provide guidance to the developers, and some even have built their own custom tools to help developers implement best practices, but the intricacies of container and serverless application development and deployment remain a challenge that slows down application development at many organizations. Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR) Public allows developers to share and deploy container software publicly Most developers building container-based applications leverage common software packages (e.g. operating systems, databases, and application components) that are publicly distributed as container images. Developers manage their container images privately within their organization using container registry services like Amazon ECR. Today, Amazon ECR customers download over three billion images each week, enabling developers to deploy containers for use in their own applications. However, when developers want to publish popular software as images publicly (e.g. language libraries, web servers, databases, etc.), they can\u2019t download it from Amazon ECR today. Instead, they must download these images from public websites and registries like Docker Hub, which limits the image pull rate under their anonymous and free plans and does not offer availability commitments. This results in inefficient and unreliable software delivery. To work around this dependency, developers are forced to duplicate and manage these common images locally. This makes it difficult to stay in sync with the latest versions of the images, adds operational complexity, and limits the ability to scale applications quickly. AWS customers who run containers from public images in multiple regions (to log events or manage network policies) face additional difficulties in getting images to download quickly and reliably, because they have to replicate their local image copy to each region. \"Customers want to run their workloads in containers for greater portability, more efficient resource utilization, and lower costs, but even with these significant advantages, customers have asked AWS to make containers easier to manage, deploy, and share,\" said Deepak Singh, VP of Compute Services, AWS. \"The innovations announced today further expand AWS\u2019s leading container functionality by giving customers a consistent Amazon ECS and Amazon EKS experience in the cloud and in their own data centers, making it radically simpler to develop and deploy container and serverless applications, and providing a fully managed public container registry to more easily store, manage, and share container images.\" The Volkswagen Group manufactures 12 of the world's most iconic automotive brands, including Volkswagen passenger cars, Audi, Bentley, Bugatti, Lamborghini, Porsche, and Ducati motorcycles. The group also includes TRATON, a leading manufacturer of light-duty commercial vehicles, trucks, and buses. \"We need our Software Development teams to solve business problems without worrying too much about infrastructure architecture and compliance,\" said Peter Garzarella, Head of Group Software Development, Volkswagen AG. \"AWS Proton enables us to provide compliant, easily consumable, and evolvable cloud infrastructure to our teams at the press of a button.\" BuzzFeed is the world\u2019s leading independent digital media company, which leverages data and innovation to reach hundreds of millions of people globally. \"Rig, our deployment platform, helps us manage a microservice ecosystem of over 600 apps including HTTP APIs & User Interfaces, queue readers, one-off jobs, and more,\" said Cl\u00e9ment Huygheba\u200bert, Director of Engineering, BuzzFeed. \"It is critical for us to ensure that development teams can quickly get the infrastructure they need while meeting our architectural standards and not having to slow down. We're excited to explore AWS Proton\u2019s feature set and see how it can help BuzzFeed provide an even smoother developer experience.\"\u200b\u200b SmugMug + Flickr is the \u200bworld\u2019s largest and most influential photographer-centric platform. \"We constantly spin up new services, and need to keep track of what is running in our infrastructure, including what is still in use and what has to be upgraded,\" said \u200b\u200bShane Meyers, \u200b\u200bPrincipal Architect, SmugMug. \"Today, our infrastructure team is involved in provisioning infrastructure for all projects and monitoring the services in use. We are looking forward to using AWS Proton, which will free up our developers to move fast while we keep all infrastructure updated to the latest standards.\" Canonical is the publisher of Ubuntu, the OS for most public cloud workloads as well as IoT, smart devices, self-driving cars, and advanced robots. \"With enterprises increasingly adopting open source applications across their cloud infrastructure, they are facing more security issues,\" said Mark Lewis, VP of Application Services, Canonical. \"While discovering vulnerabilities in container images is easier than ever, fixing them requires an ever increasing set of specialized skills and infrastructure. The Canonical LTS Docker image portfolio on Amazon ECR Public provides compliant, secure images for a growing range of applications, with a long term maintenance commitment that enterprises can rely on.\" Wish is a leading mobile-shopping app that sells a huge variety of affordable products to shoppers around the world. \"We run most of our customer-facing apps on Kubernetes clusters in AWS, and use public containers for application builds and standalone add ons,\" said Tomas Virgl, Tech Lead, Core Infrastructure, Wish. \"We pull our container images from Amazon ECR and are delighted with its uptime, as well as breadth of its features such as security scanning, multi-arch support, and ease of use. Amazon ECR Public will now let us leverage the same great features for public container images. It simplifies our registry tooling in hybrid environments and increases our confidence when apps build from a parent public image, or when we pull a public image to run.\" About Amazon Web Services  About Amazon Contacts"

Today\u2019s solutions are expensive, hard to set up, and don\u2019t scale well. Companies often have to invest in complex, proprietary hardware and software systems that take months or years to deploy, require specialized skills to configure, and can\u2019t scale up and down as call volumes fluctuate. Even when organizations manage to set up legacy on-premises or homegrown systems, they often require complex coding to make basic changes, so they quickly become outdated and are hard to maintain. These are challenges and opportunities that Amazon understands well in its own business. Amazon built the world\u2019s most scalable, functional, and cost-effective call center service to manage the dramatic growth and scale of Amazon\u2019s retail business. Over the years, customers have asked AWS if it would build an external call center service using the DNA of Amazon\u2019s own service. Amazon Connect does this by generalizing Amazon's call center software into a service that reinvents the contact center customer experience from the ground up on the cloud and with embedded machine learning. With Amazon Connect, organizations get a contact center that can be configured and set up in minutes, requires no infrastructure to deploy or manage, is easy to use, scales up and down as call volumes change, and is much more cost effective because companies only pay for the time agents are actually interacting with customers. The five new Amazon Connect capabilities launching today deliver on AWS customers\u2019 key asks \u2013 improving their agents\u2019 productivity and providing even better customer experiences. \"Amazon Connect is one of the fastest growing services in the history of AWS, and has clearly struck a chord with customers,\" said Pasquale DeMaio, General Manager, Amazon Connect, Amazon Web Services, Inc. \"Amazon Connect is the most flexible, scalable, cost-effective, and inventive call center service, in part because it was built from the ground up on the cloud with machine learning deeply embedded to automatically manage features like Interactive Voice Response (IVR), chatbots, call analytics, and sentiment analysis. Today\u2019s five new Connect features build on this foundation to make it even easier for customer service agents to have the information they need to provide faster and more holistic customer experiences, optimize agents\u2019 time based on what matters most, and enable customer service managers to take action in real time to avoid contacts that will do harm to their brand.\" Best Western Hotels & Resorts has over 4,500 hotels worldwide. \"At Best Western\u00ae Hotels & Resorts we strive to lead the hospitality industry in superior customer care, and that extends to the experience our customers have when they call our contact center,\" said Troy Tracy, Best Western Hotels & Resorts\u2019 Sr. Manager of Network and Contact Center Engineering. \"Amazon Connect equips our agents with more information about the caller, allowing them to deliver personalized experiences for our guests. With Amazon Connect\u2019s new machine learning-powered capabilities we are able to help callers more efficiently and effectively, providing the high standard of customer service that we are known for around the globe. We are excited to use Amazon Connect Profiles, Wisdom, Tasks, Voice ID, and Contact Lens for Amazon Connect, and believe they will deliver added-value for our guests.\" John Hancock is dedicated to providing innovative life insurance, investment, retirement, and advice to help customers reach their goals. \"At John Hancock, we care a lot about our customers' retirement goals. We handle tens of thousands of calls per week and our agents spend a ton of time searching through our wikis, repositories, and homegrown knowledge management systems for answers to critical financial questions,\" said Michael McCrillis, Director of Enterprise IT at John Hancock. \"Amazon Connect Wisdom will let our agents use ML-powered search across all of our existing knowledge repositories to find the right answers for customers. We are also excited that Wisdom automatically provides real-time answers to customer questions, quotes, and product specifications right within Amazon Connect during the call. Wisdom will help our agents solve customer inquiries faster, and could help significantly reduce Average Handle Time, thus creating a more seamless and positive customer experience.\" Traeger Grills has been the outdoor cooking choice of food enthusiasts. \"At Traeger, our mission is to help create a more flavorful world. Our customers are passionate about their grills. We handle tens of thousands of contact center contacts every month where people have questions on everything from grill care to WiFi connectivity. Our Traeger Techs used to spend a ton of time navigating multiple systems to find customer data,\" said Lizzy Mitchell, Head of Customer Experience Analytics at Traeger Grills. \"Amazon Connect Customer Profiles seamlessly aggregates information from our e-commerce\/marketing systems, Salesforce Service Cloud, Google\/Adobe Analytics, and Qualtrics. Now, when agents are connected to our customers, Amazon Connect automatically surfaces a unified customer profile that shows who is calling, their contact history, purchase history, and grill type. Our agents no longer have to toggle between applications to find information that helps provide a world-class customer experience. Since implementing Amazon Connect Customer Profiles, we\u2019ve seen a ~25% reduction in handle time and a ~10% increase in CSAT.\" The Los Angeles County Department of Children and Family Services promotes child safety and offers prevention services to strengthen families. It also connects children with stable, loving homes in times of need. \"Our Child Protection Hotline agents are vital to helping the most populous U.S. county, with more than 10 million people, navigate difficult domestic challenges such as child abuse reports, investigations, and foster care. Contact Lens for Amazon Connect makes our life a lot easier because we\u2019re able to look at patterns, trends, and predictions that help guide our work,\" said Carlos Torres, Division Chief for Los Angeles County\u2019s Child Protection Hotline. \"We are excited at the prospect of enabling the real-time capabilities of Contact Lens for Amazon Connect so that caller analytics and real-time alerts will \u2013 at a future time \u2013 be delivered live in our Amazon Connect supervisor dashboard so that we can help our agents navigate these difficult situations, without requiring supervisors to be there in-person, or listening to every call.\" Perspecta brings a diverse set of capabilities to our U.S. government customers in defense, intelligence, civilian, health care, and state and local markets. \"From mission services to digital transformation to enterprise operations, everything we do supports one imperative: solving some of the country\u2019s most complex challenges.

And now that extends beyond just answering calls. Our virtual receptionists spend up to two hours per day outside of telephone interactions on other contact center work, including everything from responding to open tickets to filling out forms. Typically, this would require interacting with multiple vendors and applications to do something as simple as sending an email,\" said Abilash Amarasekaran, Cloud Engineer for FULL Creative (the parent company of AnswerConnect). \"With Amazon Connect Tasks, we can prioritize and assign work items to agents based on urgency. Also, Amazon Connect Tasks automates laborious tasks that don\u2019t require agent work such as notifying a customer of a form submission or updating a ticket. For a contact center with over 900 agents, we spend an enormous amount of time on these operational tasks. Amazon Connect Tasks saves our virtual receptionists vital hours and improves productivity by 15%.\" Fujitsu is an innovative, global information technology and services provider that helps organizations across multiple industries thrive in the modern digital world by driving new value from cutting-edge digital technologies. \"At Fujitsu, our IT services exist to keep our customers\u2019 businesses running, and Amazon Connect empowers 5,300 of our contact center agents to better serve customers. Outside the 300,000 interactions our agents handle each month, they have to spend hours each day on additional tasks such as resolving open emails and tickets. This is a manual, time consuming process that often leaves important tasks incomplete,\" said Alex Sanchez, Head of Global GDC Networks for Fujitsu. \"Amazon Connect Tasks will allow our agents to prioritize, assign, and track all tasks. Through connectors to external applications such as Salesforce, Amazon Lex chatbots, and Amazon Pinpoint, we can automate tasks like follow-ups to customers.

For these customers, data has become the connective tissue that holds their complex industrial systems together. Industrial systems typically have numerous interdependent processes that operate with small tolerances for error, and even minor issues can have major ramifications. Being able to analyze data about the equipment operating in their facilities helps customers address this challenge, and many customers have embraced services like AWS IoT SiteWise as a way to collect data and generate real-time performance metrics from their industrial equipment. As customers have begun to use the cloud to collect and analyze industrial data, they have also asked for new ways to incorporate machine learning to help make sense of the data and further drive operational efficiency. In some cases, customers want to use machine learning to help them realize the promise of predictive maintenance to reduce costs and improve operational efficiency. In other cases, customers running in disconnected or latency-sensitive environments want to use computer vision at the edge to spot product defects and improve workplace safety. With these evolving needs and opportunities, industrial companies have asked AWS to help them leverage the cloud, the industrial edge, and machine learning together to get even more value from the vast amounts of data being generated by their equipment. Amazon Monitron and Amazon Lookout for Equipment enable predictive maintenance powered by machine learning  A major challenge facing industrial and manufacturing companies today is the ongoing maintenance of their equipment. Historically, most equipment maintenance is either reactive (after a machine breaks) or preventive (performed at regular intervals to ensure a machine doesn\u2019t break). Reactive maintenance can result in significant costs and downtime, while preventive maintenance can be costly, result in over-maintenance, or fail to prevent breakdown if not performed often enough. Predictive maintenance (the ability to foresee when equipment is likely to need maintenance) is a more promising solution. However, in order to make it work, companies have historically needed skilled technicians and data scientists to piece together a complex solution from scratch. This included identifying and procuring the right type of sensors for the use case and connecting them together with an IoT gateway (a device that aggregates and transmits data). Companies then had to test the monitoring system and transfer the data to on-premises infrastructure or the cloud for processing. Only then could the data scientists on staff build machine learning models to analyze the data for patterns and anomalies, or create an alerting system when an outlier was detected. Some companies have invested heavily in installing sensors across their equipment and the necessary infrastructure for data connectivity, storage, analytics, and alerting. But even these companies typically use rudimentary data analytics and simple modeling approaches that are expensive and often ineffective at detecting abnormal conditions compared to advanced machine learning models. Most companies lack the expertise and staff to build and refine the machine learning models that would enable highly accurate predictive maintenance. As a result, few companies have been able to successfully implement predictive maintenance, and those that have done it are looking for ways to further leverage their investment, while also easing the burden of maintaining their homegrown solutions. Here\u2019s how the new AWS machine learning services can help: AWS Panorama uses computer vision to improve industrial operations and workplace safety Many industrial and manufacturing customers want to be able to use computer vision on live video feeds of their facility and equipment to automate monitoring or visual inspection tasks and to make decisions in real time. For example, customers routinely need to inspect high-speed processes to determine if adjustments are needed (e.g. fine milling or laser tooling), to monitor site and yard activity to ensure operating compliance (e.g. ensure pedestrians and forklifts remain in designated work zones), or to assess worker safety within their facilities (e.g. appropriate social distancing or use of PPE). However, the typical monitoring methods used today are manual, error prone, and difficult to scale. Customers could build computer vision models in the cloud to monitor and analyze their live video feeds, but industrial processes typically need to be physically located in remote and isolated places, where connectivity can be slow, expensive, or completely non-existent. This problem is even more difficult for industrial processes that involve manual review like quality checks on manufactured parts or security feeds. For example, if a quality issue emerges on a high throughput production line, customers want to know immediately because the costs of letting the problem persist is steep. This type of video feed could be automatically processed in the cloud using computer vision, but video feeds are high bandwidth and can be slow to upload. As a result, customers are required to monitor video feeds in real time, which is hard to do, error prone, and expensive. While there is a desire to use smart cameras that have enough processing power to run these models, getting low latency performance with good accuracy from these cameras can be challenging. Most customers end up running unsophisticated models that can\u2019t be programmed to run custom code that integrates into the industrial machines. Here\u2019s how AWS can now help: The AWS Panorama Appliance provides a new hardware appliance that allows organizations to add computer vision to existing on-premises cameras that customers may already have deployed. Customers start by connecting the AWS Panorama Appliance to their network, and the device automatically identifies camera streams and starts interacting with the existing industrial cameras. The AWS Panorama Appliance is integrated with AWS machine learning services and IoT services that can be used to build custom machine learning models or ingest video for more refined analysis. The AWS Panorama Appliance extends AWS machine learning to the edge to help customers make predictions locally in sites without connectivity. Each AWS Panorama Appliance can run computer vision models on multiple camera streams in parallel, making possible use cases like quality control, part identification, and workplace safety. The AWS Panorama Appliance works with AWS and third party pre-trained computer vision models for retail, manufacturing, construction, and other industries. Also, customer-developed computer vision models developed in Amazon SageMaker can be deployed on the AWS Panorama Appliance. The AWS Panorama Software Development Kit (SDK) enables hardware vendors to build new cameras that can run meaningful computer vision models at the edge. Cameras that are built with the AWS Panorama SDK run computer vision models for use cases like detecting damaged parts on a fast-moving conveyor belt or spotting when machinery is outside of a designated work zone. These cameras can use chips designed for computer vision from NVIDIA and Ambarella. By using the AWS Panorama SDK, manufacturers can build cameras with computer vision models that can process higher quality video with better resolution for spotting issues. They can also build more sophisticated models on low-cost devices that can be powered over Ethernet and placed around a site. Customers can train their own models in Amazon SageMaker and deploy them on cameras built with the AWS Panorama SDK with a single click. Customers can also add Lambda functions to cameras built with the AWS Panorama SDK to be alerted to potential issues via text or email. AWS also offers pre-built models for tasks like PPE detection and social distancing, and can deploy these models in minutes without doing any machine learning work or special optimizations. Amazon Lookout for Vision offers automated fast and accurate visual anomaly detection for images and video at a low cost One use case where AWS customers are excited to deploy computer vision with their cameras is for quality control. Industrial companies must maintain constant diligence to maintain quality control. In the manufacturing industry alone, production line shutdowns due to overlooked errors result in millions of dollars of cost overruns and lost revenue every year. The visual inspection of industrial processes typically requires human inspection, which can be tedious and inconsistent. Computer vision brings the speed and accuracy needed to identify defects consistently, but implementation can be complex and require teams of data scientists to build, deploy, and manage the machine learning models. Because of these barriers, machine learning-powered visual anomaly systems remain out of reach for the vast majority of companies. Here\u2019s how AWS can now help these companies: \"Industrial and manufacturing customers are constantly under pressure from their shareholders, customers, governments, and competitors to reduce costs, improve quality, and maintain compliance. These organizations would like to use the cloud and machine learning to help them automate processes and augment human capabilities across their operations, but building these systems can be error prone, complex, time consuming, and expensive,\" said Swami Sivasubramanian, Vice President of Amazon Machine Learning for AWS. \"We\u2019re excited to bring customers five new machine learning services purpose-built for industrial use that are easy to install, deploy, and get up and running quickly and that connect the cloud to the edge to help deliver the smart factories of the future for our industrial customers.\" Fender Musical Instruments Corporation is an iconic brand and the world\u2019s foremost manufacturer of guitars, basses, amplifiers, and related equipment. \"Over the past year we worked with AWS to help develop the critical but sometimes overlooked part of running a successful manufacturing business, knowing your equipment condition.

    "article_text":"New machine learning powered operations service provides tailored recommendations to improve application availability Atlassian, PagerDuty, and SmugMug among the customers and partners using Amazon DevOps Guru  As more organizations move to cloud-based application deployment and microservice architectures to globally scale their businesses and operations without the limitations of on-premises deployments, applications have become increasingly distributed to meet customer needs, and developers need more automated practices to maintain application availability and reduce the time and effort spent detecting, debugging, and resolving operational issues. Application downtime events caused by faulty code or config changes, unbalanced container clusters, or resource exhaustion (e.g. CPU, memory, disk, etc.) inevitably lead to bad customer experiences and lost revenue. Companies invest considerable money and developer time to deploy multiple monitoring tools, often managed separately, and then have to develop and maintain custom alerts for common issues like spikes in load balancer errors or drops in application request rates. Setting thresholds to identify and alert when application resources are behaving abnormally is difficult to get right, involves manual setup, and requires thresholds that must be continually updated as application usage changes (e.g. an unusually large numbers of requests during holiday shopping season). If a threshold is set too high, developers don\u2019t see alarms until operational performance is severely impacted. When a threshold is set too low, developers get too many false positives, which ultimately get ignored. Even if developers get alerted to a potential operational issue, the process of identifying the root cause can still prove difficult. Using existing tools, developers often have difficulty triangulating the root cause of an operational issue from graphs and alarms, and even when they are able to find the root cause, they are often left without a means to fix it. Each troubleshooting attempt is a cold start where teams must spend hours or days to identify problems, and this leads to time consuming, tedious work that slows down the time to resolve an operational failure and can prolong application disruptions. Amazon DevOps Guru\u2019s machine learning models leverage over 20 years of operational expertise in building, scaling, and maintaining highly available applications for Amazon.com. This gives Amazon DevOps Guru the ability to automatically detect operational issues (e.g. missing or misconfigured alarms, early warning of resource exhaustion, config changes that could lead to outages, etc.), provide context on resources involved and related events, and recommend remediation actions \u2013 with no machine learning experience required. With just a few clicks in the Amazon DevOps Guru console, historical application and infrastructure metrics like latency, error rates, and request rates for all resources are automatically ingested and analyzed to establish normal operating bounds, and Amazon DevOps Guru then uses a pre-trained machine learning model to identify deviations from the established baseline. When Amazon DevOps Guru analyzes system and application data to automatically detect anomalies, it also groups this data into operational insights that include anomalous metrics, visualizations of application behavior over time, and recommendations on actions for remediation. Amazon DevOps Guru also correlates and groups related application and infrastructure metrics (e.g. web application latency spikes, running out of disk space, bad code deployments, memory leaks etc.) to reduce redundant alarms and help focus users on high-severity issues. Customers can see configuration change histories and deployment events, along with system and user activity, to generate a prioritized list of likely causes for an operational issue in the Amazon DevOps Guru console. To help customers resolve issues quickly, Amazon DevOps Guru provides intelligent recommendations with remediation steps and integrates with AWS Systems Manager for runbook and collaboration tooling, giving customers the ability to more effectively maintain applications and manage infrastructure for their deployments. Together with Amazon CodeGuru \u2013 a developer tool powered by machine learning that provides intelligent recommendations for improving code quality and identifying an application\u2019s most expensive lines of code \u2013 Amazon DevOps Guru provides customers the automated benefits of machine learning for their operational data so that developers can more easily improve application availability and reliability. \"Customers have asked us to continue adding services around areas where we can apply our own expertise on how to improve application availability and learn from the years of operational experience that we have acquired running Amazon.com,\" said Swami Sivasubramanian, Vice President, Amazon Machine Learning, Amazon Web Services, Inc. \"With Amazon DevOps Guru, we have taken our experience and built specialized machine learning models that help customers detect, troubleshoot, and prevent operational issues while providing intelligent recommendations when issues do arise. This enables teams to immediately benefit from operational best practices Amazon has learned from running Amazon.com, saving customers the time and effort that would otherwise be spent configuring and managing multiple monitoring systems.\" With a few clicks in the AWS Management Console, customers can enable Amazon DevOps Guru to begin analyzing account and application activity within minutes to provide operational insights. Amazon DevOps Guru gives customers a single-console experience to visualize their operational data by summarizing relevant data across multiple sources (e.g. AWS CloudTrail, Amazon CloudWatch, AWS Config, AWS CloudFormation, AWS X-Ray) and reduces the need to switch between multiple tools. Customers can also view correlated operational events and contextual data for operational insights within the Amazon DevOps Guru console and receive alerts via Amazon SNS. Additionally, Amazon DevOps Guru supports API endpoints through the AWS SDK, making it easy for partners and customers to integrate Amazon DevOps Guru into their existing solutions for ticketing, paging, and automatic notification of engineers for high-severity issues. PagerDuty and Atlassian are among the partners that have integrated Amazon DevOps Guru into their operations monitoring and incident management platforms, and customers who use their solutions can now benefit from operational insights provided by Amazon DevOps Guru. Amazon DevOps Guru is available in preview today in US East (N. Virginia), US East (Ohio), and US West (Oregon), Asia Pacific (Singapore), and Europe (Ireland) with availability in additional regions in the coming months. Teams at more than 170,000 companies rely on Atlassian products to make teamwork easier, and help them organize, discuss, and complete their work. \"Atlassian is proud to partner with AWS on the launch of Amazon DevOps Guru and help empower teams to deploy code and operate services with confidence,\" said Emel Dogrusoz, Head of Product, Opsgenie. \"With our new Opsgenie and Jira Service Management integration, the right teams can be immediately notified the instant Amazon DevOps Guru predicts a potential issue, or determines an incident has occurred. Amazon DevOps Guru provides a new dimension of insight, and Atlassian ensures the fastest response.\" PagerDuty, Inc.

    "article_text":"COVID-19 has changed the way we do our shopping. More people are shopping for more things online instead of going into stores, accelerating the shift to e-commerce. And these changes seem fairly permanent, as the pandemic has brought in new customers and opened new retail verticals for online shopping. With more shopping happening online, marketers are quickly following consumers. That's good for both Google and Amazon.\u00a0 Image source: Amazon. But considering the high purchase intent of Amazon searches, the influx of digital advertising in categories like consumer packaged goods or electronics heavily favors the retailer instead of the general search engine. Amazon has been eating into Google's share of product searches for years. And those searches are some of its most valuable. With Amazon seeing an influx of spending on its marketplace and growth in Prime memberships during the pandemic, investors should expect its share of product searches to have followed suit. And with more searches, there are more opportunities to sell ads. The growth of Amazon's advertising business has supported strong operating margin expansion and ought to continue to support Amazon's bottom line as consumer packaged good ad spending keeps shifting online. But Google is under investigation of antitrust practices in its dealings with Apple. What's more, Apple is reportedly developing its own search engine, which could compete with Google. If Google's forced to relinquish its hold on Safari's default search engine in one way or another, it's not like Google's share of search traffic goes to zero on the iPhone. Google still has many popular services on the iPhone despite competing default services from Apple. Google currently dominates mobile search, thanks in part to its partnership with Apple. If that relationship changes for any reason, it could put a damper on Google's ability to take the majority of search ad growth on mobile as it has in the past. It's worth reiterating the accelerating shift to e-commerce will benefit Google at least some, even if it's not as much as it benefits Amazon. Furthermore, Google and other digital advertisers will see benefits from accelerations in cord-cutting, leading to more marketers seeking digital advertising. In fact, eMarketer now expects search advertising to grow faster long-term than it forecast pre-pandemic. Google still has a lot of growth ahead, but it has a few hurdles in its way. Meanwhile, Amazon's runway is clear for accelerating advertising revenue."

    "article_text":"On Tuesday, Adobe Analytics marked down its U.S. holiday season online sales growth forecast to 30% year-over-year from 33% previously. The data analysis firm expects the holiday season will pull in $184 billion in U.S. online sales. The downward revision comes after Adobe said Cyber Monday sales rose 15.1% from the prior year to $10.8 billion, near the low-end of a prior forecast. On the positive side of the ledger, this year\u2019s Cyber Monday represented the largest U.S. online shopping day in history \u2014 that surpassed last year\u2019s record of $9.4 billion hit on Cyber Monday 2019. Adobe\u2019s Cyber Monday online read only serves to crystallize the less than inspiring start to holiday shopping for retailers. The sector is battling the one-two punch of consumers avoiding physical stores amid fear of getting sick and cautious spending online due to rising joblessness. The National Retail Federation said Tuesday, consumers spent $50 less year-over-year on holiday gifts, food and decorations from Black Friday to Cyber Monday. The number of shoppers out and about spending during the Black Friday to Cyber Monday period fell by roughly 3.2 million versus last year. \u201cAlthough stores had limits in terms of capacity, there were no real lines outside of the stores (Best Buy had picked up when we visited Friday evening; but the line seemed to reflect some capacity limits); and finding a parking spot is the easiest it has been in 15 years of store checks,\u201d points out Goldman Sachs retail analyst Kate McShane. Adds McShane, \u201cWe think the lack of crowds was already a strong hypothesis going into Black Friday given the pandemic and the trend towards digital leading up to now; however we think promotions being pulled forward to early October (we think the kick off was Amazon Prime Days on 10\/13-10\/14) likely drove a lot of early and online shopping, resulting in possible reduced demand this holiday weekend.\u201d We would be leaning toward the latter choice.

    "article_text":"Roku's growth accelerated as more people bought its streaming devices to watch shows and movies at home. Disney's growth decelerated as it shut down its theme parks, dealt with theater closures and delayed movies, and continued to lose cable subscribers to streaming platforms. Image source: Roku. Roku generated 71% of its revenue from its platform business in\u00a0the first nine months of 2020. This business generates most of its revenue from online ads and content distribution partnerships on its software platform. The remaining 29% of its revenue came from its player business, which sells its streaming hardware devices. The platform business generates much higher margins than the player business, and it generated 92% of its gross profit during the first nine months of the year. Disney generated 43% of its revenue from its Media Networks (broadcast and cable networks) unit in fiscal 2020, which ended in October. Its parks, experiences, and products division generated 25% of its revenue. Its direct-to-consumer and international (DTCI) unit, which controls its growing streaming unit, accounted for 26% of its revenue. The studio entertainment business, which handles its movie properties, accounted for another 15%. That total percentage exceeded 100% in 2020 due to eliminations between its shifting business segments. Roku's total revenue rose 57% year-over-year in the first nine months of the year, as its platform and player revenues rose 66% and 40%, respectively. Its 57% year-over-year jump in player unit sales during the third quarter notably marked its strongest growth in hardware shipments in over seven years. That robust growth indicates it isn't losing the market to rivals like Alphabet's Google Chromecast, Amazon's Fire TV, and Apple TV. Roku also finished the third quarter with 46 million active accounts, up 43% from a year earlier, and its average revenue per user (ARPU) rose 20% to $27.00 as users consumed more content and ads on it platform. However, Roku's gross margin declined as lower ad sales throughout the crisis reduced the platform unit's margins and offset its improving hardware margins. Its net loss also widened year-over-year from $44.2 million to $84.8 million in the first nine months, but it posted an operating profit in the third quarter as it cut costs throughout the pandemic. Disney's revenue fell 6% in\u00a0fiscal 2020, as rising revenue at its media networks and DTCI segments offset the double-digit declines at its studio entertainment unit and parks, experiences, and products unit. However, the loss of its higher-margin theme park and movie revenue, along with widening losses at the DTCI's streaming segment, crushed its margins and reduced its adjusted earnings by 65%. Image source: Disney. But Disney still faces an uphill battle in 2021. Its parks could close again as COVID-19 cases surge worldwide, and it could take months for a vaccine to be widely distributed. Even if the pandemic ends, the economic fallout could reduce visits to Disney's pricey parks. Its studio business will face tough year-over-year comparisons against Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker and Frozen 2, and its cable networks will likely continue to lose subscribers as it pours more cash into its money-losing streaming platforms. Analysts expect Disney's revenue to rise\u00a05% and for its earnings to dip 3% this year. But next year, they expect its revenue to rise 20% and for its earnings to more than double as its business stabilizes. That outlook seems promising, but there's still too much optimism baked into the stock at over 60 times forward earnings. I've owned shares of Disney for years, but I wouldn't add shares right now. The company isn't out of the woods yet, and the stock's premium valuation doesn't accurately reflect its near-term challenges. Roku, however, has impressed me over the past few quarters. It didn't buckle under competitive pressure from Amazon and other big rivals, and its platform continued to lock in advertisers, partners, and viewers. Roku's stock is still reasonably valued relative to its revenue growth, and its margins could improve again as ad sales accelerate. Therefore, it's still a compelling buy after its massive rally this year."

    "url":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/amazons-cloud-unit-taps-own-170924561.html",
    "article_text":"By Stephen Nellis Dec 1 (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc's cloud unit on Tuesday offered a new supercomputing service based on its self-designed processors, a further sign of how chips based on Arm Ltd's technology are encroaching on Intel Corp and Advanced Micro Devices Inc turf. Amazon Web Services, or AWS, sells its computing services based on the customer's choice of an underlying central processor chip. Software developers have traditionally chosen between Intel or AMD products, but since 2018 Amazon has also offered its own \"Graviton\" chips designed with technology from Arm, which is in the midst of a $40 billion takeover by Nvidia Corp. Arm-based chips have long powered mobile phones because they can operate on very low power levels, but they are increasingly used in data centers where their power efficiency helps control costs. The world's fastest computing system, the Fugaku supercomputer in Japan, is based on Arm chips. Supercomputing helps with tasks such as weather forecasting, medical research and modeling aerodynamics for cars without a wind tunnel. But systems remain expensive and mostly operated by governments and research centers. AWS is hoping to slash costs, saying the new service will get 40% better price-to-performance than its similar offerings from AMD and Intel. AWS's own technology will quickly pass data through multiple Graviton processors, a key supercomputing process in which many chips act as a hive mind to tackle a large task. AWS will rent the service out so that researchers need not build or manage a system. Supercomputing \"is no longer this thing that only governments do,\" Dave Brown, vice president of Elastic Compute Cloud at AWS, said in an interview. \"You can decrease the cost \u2013 you don't need a supercomputer any more. You can spin them up in the cloud and then spin them down.\" (Reporting by Stephen Nellis in San Francisco; Editing by Richard Chang)"

    "article_text":"Nutanix's fiscal first-quarter year-over-year revenue decline of 0.6%, to $312.8 million, seems weak given the attractive market for the hybrid cloud (any combination of public and private cloud) that the company addresses. The research outfit Mordor Intelligence estimates that the hybrid cloud market will have a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 18.7% by 2025. Image source: Getty Images. Nutanix is poised to capture that opportunity. Its hyper-converged infrastructure software simplifies the administration of the server, storage, and networking hardware infrastructures by virtualizing them and making them look like a private cloud. And last quarter, the company expanded its footprint to public clouds thanks to partnerships with Microsoft\u00a0and Amazon, enabling new features such as seamless application mobility between private and public clouds. In the medium term, Nutanix's solutions should allow customers to seamlessly run any workload (cloud applications) on any cloud. Despite its attractive offering, Nutanix has had heavy losses over the last several years. During the last quarter, losses increased to $265.0 million, compared to $229.3 million one year ago, because of huge sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue (82.3% during the last quarter). That poor performance partly explains why management decided to transition its sales strategy from multiyear deals to annual subscriptions in 2018 (the pivot of the tech industry to subscription offerings didn't leave many other options anyway). Revenue will remain less relevant in gauging Nutanix's performance during the transition to a subscription-based business. Therefore, management is focusing instead on metrics that depend on annual contract value (ACV), which corresponds to the total annualized value of a contract, excluding amounts related to professional services and hardware. It also aligned its sales force's compensation scheme last quarter with ACV-based metrics. Usually, I become rather skeptical when executives switch their attention to non-GAAP (adjusted) metrics. But given Nutanix's transition to a subscription-based offering, that decision makes sense. Compared to GAAP revenue, ACV-based metrics better match the ratable nature of subscriptions, which better represents the company's performance as it switches to subscriptions. So looking at the fiscal first-quarter results, the run-rate ACV (the sum of all ACV contracts at the end of the period) grew 29% year over year to $1.29 billion. And management expects run-rate ACV to increase by 25% during the next quarter. Those results indicate the transition to subscriptions is succeeding, and performance seems better than suggested by the revenue decline during the last quarter."

    "article_text":"Anaplan's third-quarter revenue increased 28% year over year to $115 million. This figure topped management's outlook from a few months ago for revenue to be as much as $110 million. Customers and prospective customers are still being affected by the pandemic, but Anaplan continues to make progress getting itself back to pre-crisis growth rates. Revenue increased 45% last year, its first full year as a public company after a late-2018 IPO.  Within the quarterly total, subscription revenue to the company's cloud-based ERP software, which an organization uses to plan everything from finances to inventory management to a marketing campaign, grew 31% from a year ago and made up over 91% of total sales. CEO Frank Calderoni said that some 60% of new bookings came from existing customers, reflecting the challenging environment for large organizations trying to free up enough budget to execute on their digital transformation.  It looks like those companies that have already embarked on their new digital journey remain in the best position to engage with Anaplan. But new deal activity is still unthawing after the freeze in the spring during the worst of the economic lockdowns. Calderoni said customers paying Anaplan at least $250,000 a year increased to 417, a 29% increase from a year ago. Image source: Getty Images. In total, Anaplan had over 1,500 customers at the end of Q3. This is still a small firm that competes in a large ERP software space worth tens of billions in global spending every year, with tech giants like Oracle, SAP, and Workday dominating the space. The market could be seeing better times soon as COVID-19 vaccines and treatments could lead to gradual normalization of the economy.  In spite of current challenges, Anaplan is making progress and setting itself up for years of growth in a post-pandemic world. Calderoni and his team said they talk to many executives a week, and end-to-end operational changes to adapt to the new digital era are top of mind for these executives. Anaplan figures to be part of those changes -- both current and future. Its software helps connect data throughout an organization to help planning teams make better decisions and predictions and untether them from reliance on past results in lieu of more timely cloud-based information. It hasn't been only existing customers propelling Anaplan's recent acceleration in growth, though. The company said one of the top 50 largest companies in the U.S. recently tapped Anaplan's ERP software to manage a more than 10,000-member salesforce, with everything from new-hire onboarding to sales forecasting getting plugged into the planning software. A healthcare distribution company with over $15 billion in annual revenue also signed up to update its processes for the new digital era. Besides replacing some of its legacy ERP rivals, Anaplan said some of these new deals are retiring decades-old software developed by IT teams in-house. \u00a0 However, as it focuses on serving large organizations, Anaplan's rebound is still tied to a greater economic recovery. Management had positive news on that front, though. Fourth-quarter revenue is forecast to be as much as 22% higher than last year, but preliminary fiscal 2022 guidance (for the 12 months ended Jan. 31, 2022) was also provided. At $550 million in sales, it implies a nearly 24% increase over this year's forecast results. Again, this is a preliminary estimate for next year subject to change, but it certainly looks like Calderoni and team are upbeat as progress on a vaccine is being made.  With a market cap currently at $9.5 billion, Anaplan stock trades for 21 times current-year expected sales and 17 times the preliminary forecast for next year. Given management's expected growth, shares look like a fair value to me. And if a vaccine means more economic normalization, I think Anaplan's actual results could be even better than projected. The company's balance sheet shows $297 million in cash and equivalents and no debt, a respectable war chest for the company to continue executing on its growth strategy. I remain optimistic on this cloud software vendor's prospects."

Some customers also want to extend the benefit of AWS Outposts to locations that may have constraints on space, power, or networking, or do not need a full rack of capacity. For example, retail stores may need to run their sales or security systems on-premises for low latency and local network access, but still want to aggregate inventory data and analyze customer behavior using data lakes and machine learning models running in an AWS Region. Other customers may have workloads that do not require a full rack of capacity, such as a hospital\u2019s patient portal, a product line-monitoring workload in a factory, or a telecommunications provider\u2019s 5G network management application. Also, for many of these use cases, customers may need to set up servers across hundreds or thousands of remote locations, which can take weeks or months. In all of these cases, customers then need to manage applications across servers, monitor health and performance of the applications and infrastructure, and ensure that the applications have the latest security patches, which is time-consuming and can impact application availability. AWS Local Zones expand to Boston, Houston, and Miami, with plans to launch 12 additional Local Zones across the US in 2021 AWS spans 77 Availability Zones within 24 geographic regions around the world, with announced plans for 15 more Availability Zones and five more AWS Regions in India, Indonesia, Japan, Spain, and Switzerland. The vast majority of customers get the necessary performance for their applications in public AWS Regions. However, for some of the more latency-sensitive and throughput-sensitive workloads (e.g. remote real-time gaming, machine learning inference, and live video streaming), customers want AWS infrastructure closer to their end-users. These latency-sensitive workloads have traditionally required customers to procure, operate, and maintain IT infrastructure in their own data center or co-location facility, adding cost and operational complexity. Customers also had to build and run these low latency application components with a different set of APIs and tools than the other parts of their applications running in AWS. Prior to today, customers could use AWS Local Zones in Los Angeles to deliver single-digit latency access to applications for end-users located in the Southern California area. However, customers outside of Southern California also want this capability for end-users in other cities across the US. \"Whether your organization has been all-in on the cloud since day one or is just beginning to move workloads to the cloud, all customers want to optimize for price performance,\" said Dave Brown, Vice President, EC2, AWS. \"As customers bring more and more workloads to the cloud, AWS continues to expand the industry\u2019s leading compute portfolio to meet their increasingly diverse needs. With the new EC2 instance types, AWS Outposts and AWS Local Zones options we\u2019re introducing today, we\u2019re providing customers with an unmatched breadth and depth of capabilities to help them innovate more cost-effectively, with the right compute for the right job.\" Datadog, Inc. is the monitoring and security platform for cloud applications. \"We\u2019re excited about the M5zn instances and the impact they can have on our high throughput compute and network intensive applications,\" said Rob Boll, Director, Runtime Platforms, at Datadog. \"Many of our compute intensive workloads will benefit from the improved performance per core, and with 100 Gbps networking throughput, we\u2019ll be able to pack workloads more efficiently onto fewer nodes. We expect to see significant infrastructure cost savings as we move our larger workloads over to M5zn instances.\" Ubitus is a cloud gaming technology leader. Through their platforms, users can enjoy a AAA gaming experience on any device including smartphones, tablets, gaming consoles, smart TVs, and computers as long as they\u2019re connected to a broadband network. \"We used AWS to partner with 505 Games to bring Control Ultimate Edition to a highly popular portable gaming device,\" said Wesley Kuo, CEO of Ubitus. \"With the new EC2 G4ad instances we have a lower cost structure, which will enable us to bring more games like Control Ultimate Edition to the mobile users globally.\" Netflix is the world's leading streaming entertainment service with over 190 million paid memberships in over 190 countries enjoying TV series, documentaries, and feature films across a wide variety of genres and languages. \"We have many artists and content creators who can benefit from bringing the on-premises infrastructure they use day-to-day to the cloud. However, every second counts, especially when it comes to the time it takes to compile and render 3D models and animations. For some time, we have wanted to move these artists' workstations to AWS in order to take advantage of the performance, elasticity, and cost benefits of the cloud. However, due to the interactive nature of these applications, our artists need very low latency access to their workstations to have a good working experience,\" said Nils Pommerien, Director, Cloud Infrastructure Engineering, Netflix. \"AWS Local Zones, which bring cloud resources closer to our artists, have been a game-changer for these applications. By taking advantage of access to AWS's highly performant and cost-effective compute resources, we have been able to migrate portions of our content creation process to AWS Local Zones, while ensuring an even better experience for artists.\" Mindbody is the leading technology platform for the fitness, wellness, and beauty industries. \"We have a portfolio of interdependent applications running in our existing on-premises data centers. We have been looking to move these workloads to the public cloud for some time. However, it is daunting to migrate such complex, interdependent applications to the cloud at the same time while ensuring a seamless experience for our end users,\" said John Strong, Senior Director of Production Engineering, Mindbody. \"AWS Local Zones have solved a significant problem for us here. We are using Local Zones to migrate our complex, legacy on-premises applications to AWS without an expensive revamp of our architecture. With a Direct Connect to Local Zones, we are able to establish a hybrid environment that provides ultra-low latency communication between applications running in the Local Zone and our on-premises installations. In turn, this has enabled us to migrate applications incrementally, simplifying our migrations drastically while reducing any business risk with on-going hybrid deployments.\" About Amazon Web Services About Amazon Contacts"

Pinterest is targeting 60% revenue growth in the fourth quarter, and the company is well-positioned for growth after the pandemic as its user base has surged during the crisis, and verticals that have historically been strong like weddings and travel will bounce back when the economy normalizes.

By 2040, the U.S. Census Bureau predicts that there will be 80 million Americans 65 and older. That's double the 2010 population of the same age cohort. As Baby Boomers age, this generation will live longer than any other in history. CareTrust is set to play an important role in caring for and providing access to seniors housing for this generation. Investors who buy now can enjoy a 5% dividend for now, and then multiple decades of growth to follow.\u00a0\u00a0 Tanger offered its tenants the ability to defer rents in April and May as the first wave of the pandemic raged, and many tenants took the company up on the offer. Rent collection has improved dramatically since then \u2013 Tanger collected 89% of billed rents for the third quarter, up from just 47% in the second quarter. Over 99% of occupied stores had reopened by the end of the third quarter, and visitor traffic in September had essentially fully recovered despite fewer operating hours. Of course, a tough winter featuring increased pandemic restrictions and more retailer bankruptcies could hurt Tanger's results. But the company has plenty of liquidity to ride out the storm. Total liquidity sat at $640 million at the end of October, including $600 million of fully unused credit lines. No significant debt matures for Tanger until the end of 2023, and the company pays an average interest rate of just 3.6% on its existing debt. The current management team, led by CEO Lourenco Goncalves, inherited a mess of a company in 2014. The prior management team had taken on a \"growth at all costs\" strategy at the height of the Chinese commodity boom. As iron ore and steel prices started to decline, it left the company with a cornucopia of bad assets, a slag pile of debt, and was looking like it was days from bankruptcy. The steelmaking and iron ore business is a tough one. It is highly sensitive to economic output, its margins aren't super high, and it's capital intense. This new strategy has more than doubled the company's debt from its low point and turned free cash flow negative, as the company invests in its new operations and shoulders their debt. That said, Cleveland-Cliffs management has proved that it can deftly navigate a challenging industry and generate shareholder returns. Wall Street hasn't noticed this until recently -- shares are up more than 30% so far this year -- but there is still plenty of room for America's largest steelmaker to integrate its new businesses and generate returns.\u00a0 This will go down as a year to remember (or forget)! Surely, you don't need to run out and buy all five of these stocks right now. But they're all worthy of your consideration.

(Photo: Business Wire) Supersonic aircraft require a precise combination of performance, structural stability, and safety that makes designing them both resource and time intensive. With an on-premises infrastructure, a design team would have to manage a large queue of design iterations running one after the other, to find the right balance. However, by tapping into the virtually unlimited scale of AWS HPC resources, Boom can run thousands of advanced computer simulations concurrently, far faster and more cost-effectively than ever before possible, resulting in an estimated 6x increase in productivity versus running these simulations in an on-premises environment. In order to refine its design, conduct stress tests, and simulate flight conditions for XB-1, Boom utilized more than 53 million compute hours on AWS with expectations to scale to more than 100 million compute hours in order to complete design and testing of its Overture airliner. By going all-in on AWS, Boom is able to leverage AWS\u2019s global infrastructure and unmatched portfolio of services to manufacture aircraft that meet security and compliance regulations while delivering on its commitment to sustainability. Boom plans to use AWS services, including capabilities in Internet of Things, machine learning, compute, storage, security, managed database, and analytics to build its 65-88-seat supersonic airliner and transform the flight experience for passengers. In addition, Boom\u2019s 525 terabyte repository of XB-1 design and testing data will be stored in AWS, along with its core IT applications which will streamline the company\u2019s operations so it can focus on innovation. Boom also plans to build a data lake for its manufacturing operations on Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), and use AWS IoT services including AWS IoT Core (a cloud service that lets connected devices easily and securely interact with cloud applications and other devices) to collect and process real-time data from its manufacturing equipment. Leveraging AWS analytics and machine learning services, Boom will gain deeper insights into its manufacturing processes to inform future decision-making, streamline workflows, and improve quality control. In addition to developing its state-of-the art aircraft design, which promises to be the next major innovation in high speed air travel since jet airplanes were introduced more than 60 years ago, Boom also plans for Overture to be the most passenger-centric airliner in the world by offering passengers superior comfort, tranquility, and productivity. To support this development, Boom is exploring how AWS IoT and machine learning solutions can be used inside the Overture cabin to reimagine the on-board experience for both passengers and crew, looking at ways to customize passenger messaging, deliver intelligent in-flight entertainment, create wearables for crew members, and improve on-time departure performance using live occupancy and equipment data. \"Boom is committed to making supersonic flight mainstream by leveraging improvements in technology, sustainability, and passenger experience. As we build the first supersonic airliner in a new age of travel, AWS, the world\u2019s leading cloud provider, will help us continuously refine our designs without compromise so that we can deliver a superior flight experience to the flying public,\" said Blake Scholl, Founder and CEO of Boom Supersonic. \"AWS\u2019s proven infrastructure and unparalleled portfolio of services are helping us deliver a revolution in air travel.\" \"Boom is taking a born-in-the-cloud approach to innovation and embracing the breadth, depth, and performance of AWS to reinvent commercial supersonic air travel,\" said Teresa Carlson, Vice President, Worldwide Public Sector and Regulated Industries at Amazon Web Services, Inc. \"We are thrilled to be collaborating with Boom to leverage the cloud to launch the next era of travel. By going all-in on AWS, Boom can innovate without bounds and more quickly than was previously possible, to make the world more accessible to everyone.\" About Amazon Web Services About Amazon About Boom Supersonic Contacts"

    "article_text":"(Bloomberg) -- Online shoppers in the U.S. spent $10.8 billion on Cyber Monday, missing Adobe Inc.\u2019s original projection by almost $2 billion, evidence that retailers pulled sales forward by offering deals earlier than usual. Still, the gusher of online spending was a record, rising 15% from 2019. \u201cCyber Monday continued to dominate the holiday shopping season, becoming the biggest online shopping day in U.S. history, despite early discounts from retailers,\u201d Taylor Schreiner, director of Adobe Digital Insights, said in a statement. \u201cThroughout the remainder of the holiday season, we expect to see record sales continue and curbside pickup to gain even more momentum as shoppers avoid crowds and potential shipping delays.\u201d Hot sellers included toys such as Lego sets and scooters, video games like Super Mario 3D All-Stars, and electronics including Apple AirPods, Hewlett Packard & Dell Computers and Chromecast, Adobe said. The pandemic-fueled stampede online was a valuable opportunity for retailers such as Amazon.com Inc., Walmart Inc., Target Corp., Best Buy Co., which had been preparing for the 2020 holiday deluge for months. There were occasional hiccups, but the industry\u2019s investments in delivery capacity and parking lot pickup helped get it through the Thanksgiving weekend and Cyber Monday. Black Friday spending of $9 billion also missed Adobe\u2019s forecast of $10.3 billion, another sign of cautious consumer spending during the pandemic and shoppers reacting to deals earlier in the holiday season. Amazon vacuumed up $1 of every $5 spent over the Black Friday weekend, the first time the Seattle-based giant accounted for the highest share of spending for the period, according to market research firm Numerator. But Cyber Monday will likely still be the peak, because many shoppers are conditioned to hold off on big purchases in anticipation of price cuts. Cyber Monday deals mostly weren\u2019t much better than Black Friday deals, said Kristin McGrath, editor at BlackFriday.com, which monitors web deals. Harkening back to traditional door-buster Black Friday tactics, many digital shops are likely to offer eye-popping discounts on popular products that usually sell out quickly to attract people to their site, hoping they linger and load up shopping carts with other things. \u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P."

Its appeal to younger investors, gives insight into what the next generation is interested in. Not surprisingly, tech and growth names lead the list of Robinhood's most popular stocks. While some of these have had great financial success, others show the exposure to speculation that this demographic of investors seem to be overly comfortable with.\u00a0 These are three stocks Robinhood investors are interested in, as of Nov. 27, 2020. \u00a0 This year has only helped the story. COVID-19, the subsequent economic shutdown, and social distancing all led consumers online to do more of their shopping. \u00a0\u00a0Names like Amazon, Walmart, and Target all had distinct advantages in comparison to smaller operations when it comes to maneuvering this kind of tumultuous event. After the shutdown ended, Amazon has continued to benefit from social distancing. Third quarter sales ended September 30. increased a whopping 37%.  Image source: Getty Images. The e-commerce titan recently launched its online pharmacy business in the United States, furthering the company's attempts to leverage price and online convenience to derive market share in new spaces. Not everything Amazon does always works, but if the company can offer a better deal in terms of pricing and convenience, it's hard to see Amazon Pharmacy not adding value to the company.  Accusations by short-sellers that the company's top executives were making investments in useless entities for profit led to a bit of chaos for Aphria. Since CEO Vic Neufeld stepped down, investors are more focused on sales and the bottom line. Revenue growth has been phenomenal. Estimates don't call for Aphria to start producing profitable earnings until 2023.  Of course, if estimates were always right, investing would be a pretty easy game. This is a situation where shareholders could see big returns if the company can shift to meaningful profitability, while avoiding overextending itself to do it. The company has expanded in Europe, serving as one of the main medical suppliers for Germany, with operations in other countries as well. The Sweetwater acquisition takes Aphria into something new. Of course, the desired integration in which Aphria can sell cannabis infused drinks, will be a tough sell in the U.S. for quite some time. Investors could be waiting a long time to see Aphria start making some real money.\u00a0 Disney (NYSE:DIS) has been an investment gem for a long time. Today, the company is at a crossroads. COVID-19 has ravaged its theme park business, resulting in a big financial headache. On the flipside, it's foray into streaming through Disney plus, Hulu, and its 21st century fox assets, have all benefited from social distancing. Finishing its fiscal year on October 3, Disney saw a 23% decline in revenues for the fiscal fourth quarter. The divided nature of their businesses, can be seen in the variations in growth. Media Networks were up 14% for the full fiscal year, while direct-to-consumer\/international revenues increased 81%; demonstrating the huge rise in Disney's streaming business. That subscription revenue wasn't enough to fend off the declines in parks\/experiences and studio entertainment, with revenue fallout of 37% and 13% respectively. In all, operating income from parks\/experiences shifted from $6.76 billion the year before, to a loss of $81 million in fiscal 2020. Studio entertainment operating income declined 7% to $2.5 billion. The stock is up since Disney reported earnings on Nov. 12, thanks to losses that were less than expected. Overall, there seems to be a blend of momentum between the overall market rally, combined with expectations that vaccines for COVID-19 will help Disney's parks business get back into the swing of it.

    "article_text":"BlackBerry stock was up 35%, or $2.11, at the opening bell on the New York Stock Exchange. It's a sign of both the potential market for smart vehicle services and the ability of Amazon businesses to boost the fortunes of businesses with its attention. The former undisputed heavyweight of the smartphone market, BlackBerry has transformed itself into a provider of business security and information integration services, and it's through this transformation that the company attracted the attention of Amazon's web services business. \u201cIn the past five years we\u2019ve gone from BlackBerry QNX technology helping to power 60 million cars to today\u2019s announcement of more than 175 million \u2013 a nearly threefold increase and a testament to the fact that today\u2019s leading automakers and their tier one suppliers continue to put their trust in BlackBerry and our ability to provide them with safe and secure software upon which the next generation of vehicles is being built,\u201d said John Chen, executive chairman and CEO, BlackBerry. The newest iteration of connected car services from the Waterloo, Canada-based company allows automakers to read vehicle sensor data coming off of equipment from multiple vendors, normalize that data and provide insights around the data for use either remotely or in vehicles. The IVY software system can run inside a vehicle's embedded systems, but configured from the cloud to let automakers providers drivers with features that can include indications about road conditions, driver performance, or battery use for electric vehicles. The BlackBerry toolkit can also make it easier for automakers to collaborate with a wider pool of developers to create new services around vehicle performance optimization, reduce maintenance costs and perform remote software updates on vehicles. Call it the potential for the Tesla-fication of a broad class of vehicles that use the service. \u201cData and connectivity are opening new avenues for innovation in the automotive industry, and BlackBerry and AWS share a common vision to provide automakers and developers with better insights so that they can deliver new services to consumers,\u201d said Chen in a statement. \u201cThis software platform promises to bring an era of invention to the in-vehicle experience and help create new applications, services, and opportunities without compromising safety, security, or customer privacy. We are pleased to expand our relationship with AWS to execute this vision and deliver BlackBerry IVY.\u201d Meanwhile... The Internet has jokes."

    "article_text":"First, Alibaba's online marketplaces don't take on inventories, but Amazon does. Second, Alibaba generates all of its profits from its core commerce business, and its cloud business is unprofitable.

Therefore, Alibaba subsidizes the growth of its cloud platform with its e-commerce profits, while Amazon supports its e-commerce business with its cloud platform's profits. Image source: Getty Images. Alibaba Cloud is Alibaba's second-largest business. It generated 8% of its revenue last year, but it's never generated an annual profit.

However, Alibaba Cloud's adjusted EBITA margin gradually improved as economies of scale kicked in: Fiscal Year 2018 2019 2020 Adjusted EBITA Margin (6%) (5%) (4%) Source: Alibaba. In the first half of 2020, Alibaba Cloud's revenue rose 68% year over year to $4.01 billion as the COVID-19 crisis caused companies to ramp up their spending on cloud services to support their online platforms. It attributed that growth to robust demand from the internet, finance, and retail sectors, as well its growing penetration rate in China and ARPU (average revenue per user). Alibaba Cloud's operating loss widened year over year from $481 million to $820 million during the first half of the year, but its adjusted EBITA loss narrowed from $123 million to $73 million. CFO Maggie Wu also said Alibaba Cloud would \"definitely\" achieve \"profitability in the following two quarters,\" and it could eventually match the margins of \"other peer companies\" over the long term. Wu was presumably referring to Amazon, as most of Alibaba Cloud's other rivals are either unprofitable or don't disclose their cloud profits. However, Alibaba probably only expects Alibaba Cloud to turn profitable on an adjusted EBITA basis -- which excludes stock-based compensation, taxes, interest, and other variable expenses -- instead of a GAAP basis. AWS, by comparison, is firmly profitable by GAAP measures. Therefore, the underlying profitability of Alibaba Cloud might be improving, but investors shouldn't cheer until the segment's GAAP operating losses actually start to narrow."

    "article_text":"As a cloud data platform, Snowflake leverages the elasticity and performance of the public cloud to enable customers to unify and query big data. Its cloud-native architecture offers three major service layers: Essentially, Snowflake customers feed massive sets of raw data into the cloud and receive back analytics-ready data, useful for distilling business insights and delivering revenue-generating services. With a highly scalable model that allows customers to pay per use, the company has proven exceedingly popular as more and more businesses turn to cloud-based warehousing solutions. Image source: Snowflake. In one year alone, Snowflake has more than doubled its number of customers, with existing customers increasing their usage significantly over time. Consequently, the company's revenue has increased rapidly, growing 121% year over year by the second quarter of fiscal year 2021. On a yearly basis, Snowflake experienced a 174% increase in revenue from fiscal year 2019 to 2020. And all of this is attributable to its competitive advantages. Despite this, Snowflake has a growing number of customers. Why? The company takes innovation and customer needs very seriously, consistently adjusting its offerings to accommodate where its competitors currently do not. Snowflake's competitive offerings include integration of diverse data types, massive scalability without sacrificing performance, simultaneous use cases and users, and extreme ease of use.\u00a0 Image source: Getty Images. Indeed, possibly its greatest competitive advantage comes from its easy-to-use platform and cloud-based architecture. Just as Shopify attracts businesses for its turn-key solutions, Snowflake's made-for-the-cloud platform entices businesses with its scalable, high-performance data-warehousing solution. However, as a company that runs on its competitors' public clouds, Snowflake exposes itself to some unique risks. Any outages or security issues will affect Snowflake as well. Furthermore, the company is extremely young, with a limited operating history, and therefore has very little data on which to forecast its future viability. It has also posted deepening operating losses, as the company experiences the costly growth spurt so typical of today's high-value tech stocks. Given this, from fiscal year 2019 to 2020, Snowflake has delivered net losses of $348 million, even though it boasts a gross profit margin of 61%. "

    "article_text":"Let's take a look at why JFrog freed up its locked-up shares ahead of schedule, why that decision caused its stock to drop, and whether or not it should influence our long-term view of this high-growth company. Image source: Getty Images. When JFrog went public in\u00a0September, it stated that 88% of its ordinary shares would remain locked up for 180 days. However, it also struck an agreement with its underwriters in which 25% of its shares could be unlocked if \"certain price and other conditions\" were met. Those exact conditions weren't publicly disclosed, but they likely required JFrog's stock to remain above a certain price and maintain adequate trading volumes before insiders could sell some of their shares. The agreement initially required JFrog to meet those conditions \"on or after\" Dec. 14. But that day coincides with JFrog's blackout period -- during which insider sales are banned -- ahead of its next earnings report. As a result, the date was moved up to Nov. 20, and 25% of the locked-up shares were freed up for public trading on Nov. 25. When JFrog's stock fell on Nov. 23, the decline wasn't caused by the actual lock-up release, which happened two days later. Instead, investors sold the stock on fears that insiders would dump their shares. However, the stock rebounded and actually rallied 12% on Nov. 25, so insiders weren't eager to take profits, even after the stock rose over 50% from its IPO price of $44 per share. Therefore, JFrog's leap on Nov. 25 is an encouraging sign, and suggests both insiders and retail investors are bullish on the stock's prospects. Large companies often install a wide range of software across different computing platforms and services, and manually updating that software is tedious, time-consuming, and prone to human error. JFrog's core product, Artifactory, stores those updates in a universal repository that can be accessed by any computing platform. It then automates those updates with its continuous software release management (CSRM) system. Image source: Getty Images. JFrog's streamlined approach is disruptive, and about 75% of the Fortune 500 companies now use its services. Its revenue rose 65% to $104.7 million last year, and it narrowed its net loss from $26 million to $5.4 million. In the first nine months of 2020, its revenue rose 46% year over year to $108.1 million, but its net loss widened from $5.2 million to $5.7 million. For the full year, it expects its revenue to rise 42%-43%. JFrog's business still looks healthy, but it faces competition from bigger companies like IBM's Red Hat, Amazon Web Services (AWS), and Microsoft's Azure. Its trailing 12-month net retention rate, which measures the year-over-year spending growth in its existing customers, also dipped from 142% at the end of 2019 to 136% at the end of the third quarter. In the end, JFrog's early lock-up release is really just short-term noise. It didn't dilute its existing shares like a secondary offering would, and the company's insiders didn't seem eager to cash out. There are still plenty of reasons to sell JFrog's stock, but it's futile to fret over lock-up periods."

    "article_text":"It's easy to look at a penny stock and be tempted. After all, you can buy a whole lot of shares when a stock trades for less than $5. And with just a $1 share-price increase, it could be a big winner. That's tempting. It's also dangerous. Stocks trading with such low share prices are usually cheap for a reason, and it's not a good one. Buying hundreds of shares might feel like a bargain, but it's important to remember that the number of shares isn't what matters. Your total investment is the number to focus on. Think of it this way: A 10% increase on a $1,000 investment means a $100 gain. Whether you own 1,000 shares or half a share, it's still a $100 gain. Image source: Getty Images. I know, I know. You were thinking penny stocks, and this company trades at more than $3,100 per share! Hear me out (and remember that you can buy fractional shares if needed). On top of Prime, here are two facts that make me optimistic as a shareholder: Amazon hired 350,000 full- and part-time employees in just four months during the third quarter and early in the fourth quarter. The company is preparing for what's expected to be huge holiday demand. These types of investments are expensive, but they build long-term value through customer loyalty and acquisition. Additionally, it only seems like everyone is buying everything online these days. They're not. E-commerce accounted for just 14% of U.S. retail sales in the third quarter, according to U.S. Census data. There's still substantial room for Amazon to grow in e-commerce. With Amazon Web Services and Amazon Advertising also driving growth, this company looks like a long-term market beater. First, Roku moved quickly in connected TV. That helped it build a massive subscriber base, with 46 million active accounts. While the company doesn't report total users, eMarketer estimated that there were more than 84 million in the United States (before the pandemic), making Roku the market leader in streaming TV platforms. Amazon's Fire TV is second and others are well behind. Roku's scale is a competitive advantage. Content providers want to be on the platform because that's where the viewers are. As more content comes onto the platform, it attracts more viewers. That cycle provides a powerful opportunity for future revenue growth, which brings me to the second big reason I like Roku: It's monetizing that huge user base through advertising. The company has been driving ad growth through the Roku Channel. It has also launched OneView, a platform that marketers can use to buy advertising \"programmatically\" -- using online software to target specific audiences instead of the traditional method of buying from advertising representatives. eMarketer estimates that U.S. ad spending on streaming platforms will more than double in the next four years, from $8.11 billion in 2020 to $18.29 billion in 2024. Roku is perfectly positioned to capitalize on that trend. DocuSign uses a land-and-expand business model -- land customers, then get them to expand spending. Its second-quarter results show that the strategy is working. (The third-quarter report will be released on Dec. 3.) DocuSign reported a record 120% dollar-based net retention rate, which means customers who were on the platform a year ago spent 20% more this year. The number of customers with an annual contract value of more than $300,000 increased 41% year over year to 520. Is there room for more growth? With a customer base that's grown 75% in two years to 749,000, DocuSign has a lot of expansion opportunities. Typically, that comes in additional use cases for eSignature within an organization. However, there's a longer-term growth story in the company's Agreement Cloud, which offers more than a dozen products. DocuSign's goal is to become part of their larger customers' infrastructure for managing agreements, from the start of the process to the end. A disappointing quarter could cause the stock price to temporarily fall, maybe steeply. While that may not happen, those types of moves can cause selling at the worst time. (I've been guilty.) By contrast, a long-term view allows a company to execute its strategies. I bought shares of Roku and DocuSign this month, and Amazon is one of the largest stock positions in my portfolio. I believe all three can provide market-beating returns for years."

    "article_text":"Li Auto reported deliveries of 4,646 Li One EVs in November, up 25.8% from October. The data also came a day after Goldman Sachs hiking its price targets on Nio stock and Li Auto. On Tuesday, Nio said it delivered 5,291 vehicles last month, a 109% jump vs. a year earlier. The company said it was \"in the process\" of speeding up production capacity expansion this month to handle the increase in orders. Xpeng delivered 4,224 smart electric vehicles in November, a 342% year-over-year increase. The company's smart sports sedan, the P7, led the gains. The P7 competes against the made-in-China Tesla Model 3. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs on Monday raised its price target on Li Auto to 60 from 20.60 and on Nio to 59 from 7.70. Goldman also upgraded Nio stock to neutral, from sell. Goldman predicted that electric vehicle penetration in China would reach 20% by 2025, up from 5% this year. It sees that penetration reaching 53% in 2035 and 80% in 2050. Tesla recently expanded manufacturing capacity it its Shanghai Giga factory to begin producing the Model Y. The U.S. electric-vehicle maker also sells its Model 3 cars in China. Goldman's EV stocks analysts said they believed Li Auto was \"differentiating itself from the broader Chinese auto-making industry by envisioning and creating compelling EV consumer experiences \u2014 and showing a willingness to take on the risk of unconventional technologies and act innovatively.\" They added that the company's Li One vehicle, launched last year, was the bestselling electric SUV in China. The analysts said they expected Li Auto to use the Li One as a platform for offering autonomous driving, among other things, that would help drive longer-term adoption. Goldman also said the Li One had the largest interior space of any top-selling electric vehicle in China, and a longer driving range. For Nio, the EV stocks analysts said their downgrade to sell, in July, was based on a belief that \"the share price at the time reflected over-optimism given no substantial changes to volume\/profit expectations.\" \"In hindsight,\" the analysts continued, \"we underestimated the benefits to Nio from: (1) powertrain breakthroughs, particularly with the cell-to-pack\/blade large cell technologies; (2) the introduction of Nio's battery as a service (BaaS) program, which has significantly expanded Nio's addressable market; and (3) regulatory incentives that turned around EV market demand from an ongoing decline.\" Nio's battery as a service program, launched in August, allows drivers to buy a car without a battery, but subscribe to different battery packs, based on their needs, on a monthly basis.

    "article_text":"Wednesday, December 2, 2020 In the end, the deal that was supposed to put Nikola on a path to greatness is, as Wedbush analyst Dan Ives put it, \u201cnothing to write home about.\u201d Hindenburg said a video appearing to show one of the company\u2019s tractor trailers driving under its own power was in fact simply showing the vehicle coasting down a hill. It also said that a prior stage demonstration of a tractor trailer that was supposed to be operating on its own power actually showed the vehicle plugged into a power supply under the stage. Separately, on Sept. 19, Milton and the company received grand jury subpoenas from the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of New York. Finally, on Sept. 21, the company received a subpoena from the New York County District Attorney\u2019s Office. Oh, and at least five putative class action lawsuits were filed against the company as well as current and former directors, alleging the firm and its employees lied in public statements about Nikola\u2019s business plan and prospects. So what does the Nikola and GM deal mean? Originally, the companies were supposed to come together to bring GM\u2019s hydrogen fuel cell and battery technologies to Nikola\u2019s tractor trailers and see GM build Nikola\u2019s planned Badger electric and hybrid pickup truck. The automaker was also supposed to take an 11%, or roughly $2 billion, stake in Nikola. That\u2019s out the window now. The terms of the new agreement, which is actually a non-binding memorandum of understanding, say that GM will supply Nikola with its fuel cell technology, but will not take that $2 billion stake in the firm. The move is a major repudiation of the vision for Nikola under Milton, and puts the firm on track to focus on its tractor trailer business. All of that comes from a company that hasn\u2019t actually sold any completed vehicles. Investors hungry to get in on a Tesla-like stock early enough for them to reap the rewards if it turns into an automotive juggernaut saw Nikola as the perfect opportunity. Its founder and CEO was an enthusiastic salesman in the vein of Tesla\u2019s Elon Musk, its vehicles were set to take on the biggest automakers in the world, and it was looking to upend the trucking industry. But not every company will be a Tesla. Even Tesla, which with a market cap of more than $550 billion is now worth more than any other automaker on the planet, faced a series of setbacks including overpromising on delivery targets and dealing with production issues. It\u2019s no small feat that Tesla is where it is now. And it\u2019s possible Nikola could overcome its own setbacks \u2014 if it focuses on its trucking initiatives. The revised deal with GM is a \u201cpositive outcome\u201d for Nikola in the medium- and long-term since it can focus on its core Class 8 truck and avoid the distraction of the Badger pickup, JPMorgan analyst Paul Coster wrote in a research note following the GM announcement. While Ives also acknowledged Nikola has solid ideas for the trucking market, he says the GM deal will be a hard pill for investors to swallow. \u201cThere is only one Tesla and Musk but there will be many successful players in the EV market for the next decade and Nikola is hoping to be one of those vendors,\u201d Ives said. \u201cFor now they have some Herculean-like challenges ahead.\u201d"

    "article_text":"\u201cOur view is at the index level it won\u2019t be a huge impact,\u201d Stuart Kaiser, UBS head of equity derivatives Research, told Yahoo Finance Live. Kaiser\u2019s team ran an analysis modeling Tesla as a member of the S&P 500 this year, and found that overall realized volatility rose only 0.1 percentage point on average \u2014 and at most 1 percentage point at certain times. \u201cHopefully, fund managers have had enough time to get themselves rebalanced into it. It\u2019s been a popular stock. You may have a lot of investors that have owned this outside of a benchmark anyway,\u201d Kaiser said. All of that said, Tesla\u2019s impact on volatility in one area of the market could be more significant. It will join the S&P 500 as a member of the consumer discretionary subgroup, with a 13% weighting, according to Kaiser (that compares with 37% for Amazon in that sector). UBS research shows that realized volatility in consumer discretionary would have risen 1.5 points on average in 2020, and as much as six points in September."

    "article_text":"U.S. stocks were super steady in November on back-to-back upbeat vaccine update from pharma companies likePfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca. This raised hopes of a return to normalcy sooner than expected. Moreover, chances of a divided Congress in the United States, which means status quo and the likelihood of no major policy changes in the medium term, aided the equity rally. As a result, the S&P 500 (up 10.8%), the Dow Jones (up 11.9%), the Nasdaq Composite (up 11.8%) and the Russell 2000 (up 18.3%) \u2014 all put up a great show last month. The Dow Jones logged its best month since 1987 (and its best November since 1928). The S&P 500 posted its best November ever. The Nasdaq Composite recorded its best monthly performance since April 2020. The \u00a0industrials and financials sectors clocked their best month since April 2009 while the energy sector as represented by the ETF XLE saw its second-best month ever. On Dec 1, a group of bipartisan senators announced a $908 billion \"framework\" for\u00a0COVID-19\u00a0relief. This stimulus hope is a great positive. Hence, with a favorable investing backdrop at the start of December, we expect the November rally to continue. Against this backdrop, below we highlight a few ETF picks for the current month. Siren Nasdaq NexGen Economy ETF BLCN The price of bitcoin hit a new all-time-high on Nov 30, helped by institutional buying. Bitcoin registered its previous all-time high in mid-December 2017. Corporations\u2019 greater acceptance in allowing customers to hold bitcoin and other virtual coins in their online wallets and shopping has been favoring the cryptocurrency. Several central banks are considering the rollout of digital currency lately (read: ETFs to Gain As Bitcoin Surges). Facebook-backed cryptocurrency Libra has also been rebranded \u201cDiem\u201d in an effort to gain regulatory approval by refurbishing the project in a simpler manner. Though investors cannot lay their hands on a digital currency ETF now, they can definitely familiarize with the concept through blockchain ETFs like\u00a0BLCN.  ARK Autonomous Technology & Robotics ETF ARKQ S&P Dow Jones Indices will add Tesla Inc. to its benchmark S&P 500 Index all at a time on Dec 21. \u201c(Tesla) will be one of the largest weight additions to the S&P 500 in the last decade, and consequently will generate one of the largest funding trades in S&P 500 history,\u201d S&P Dow Jones Indices,\u00a0as quoted on Reuters. \u201cWith a\u00a0stock market value over $400 billion, Tesla will be among the most valuable companies ever added\u201d to the S&P 500.\u00a0In any case, Tesla has been a hot stock this year. \u00a0 Tesla\u2019s \u201cinclusion means investment funds indexed to the S&P 500 will have to sell about $51 billion worth of shares of companies already in the S&P 500 and use that money to buy shares of Tesla, so that their portfolios correctly reflect the index\u201d, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices, quoted on Reuters (read: ETFs to Play as Tesla Likely to Join the S&P 500 in December). This in turn may benefit Tesla-heavy ETF ARKQ. The fund stresses on autonomous technology and robotics companies that follow theme of disruptive innovation. Vanguard Russell 2000 Value ETF VTWV According to Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research in New York, \u201cNovember has historically been the best month for the Russell 2000, however, December typically yields the second-best monthly performance.\u201d The Russell 2000 delivered an average return of 2.15% in December, jumping 76% of the time for the highest occurrence of advancement, compared with an average gain of 1.47% for the S&P 500 and a 73% frequency of gains, Stovall pointed out, as quoted in a source. Vaccine hopes and Biden\u2019s transition, in any case, will make the case for small-cap value investing stronger (read: Why Is This the Right Time to Bet on Small-Cap Value ETFs?). SPDR S&P Retail ETF XRT NRF noted that the retail sector has witnessed a V-shaped recovery as aggregate retail sales have grown both sequentially and year over year each month since June. NRF expects that online and other non-store sales will grow between 20% and 30% this year.\u00a0Overall, the retail sector is expected to log a \u201cstrong finish\u201d to 2020 despite COVID-19. Amazon also had its \u201cbiggest holiday season to date\u201d as customers turned to online shopping and dumped the in-store ones (read: ETFs to Win\/Lose From Thanksgiving Amid COVID-19 Restrictions). Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF VYM As risk-on sentiments are likely to continue for some more time, we will end up seeing in an uptick in treasury yields.

    "article_text":"The stock's big hit this morning was likely due to a tweet last night from noted investor Michael Burry. The former hedge fund manager, who is well known for predicting and profiting from the subprime mortgage crisis, said he is currently shorting Tesla stock. Model 3. Image source: Tesla. \"So, [Elon Musk], yes, I'm short $TSLA, but some free advice for a good guy... Seriously, issue 25-50% of your shares at the current ridiculous price,\" tweeted Burry. \"That's not dilution. You'd be cementing permanence and untold optionality.\" By shorting a stock, investors can make money when a stock declines. Of course, the opposite is true as well: The investor can lose money on their short position when a stock rises. Tesla will need to execute with near-flawless precision going forward to justify its valuation. Specifically, the electric-car maker will likely need to keep growing its vehicle sales at rates of 30% to 50% annually, demonstrate even faster growth in its nascent green energy business, and make substantial progress toward autonomous driving.\u00a0 Despite Tesla stock's pricey valuation, investors may want to refrain from shorting the stock. Given the company's stellar execution recently, betting against the automaker seems like a risky bet. After all, investors could easily just avoid the stock entirely if they are not comfortable with the stock's valuation. In addition, shorting is generally considered very risky, and investors should be sure to fully understand the risks of shorting before they do so."

S&P Dow Jones Indices announced it would add the electric car maker to the index in a single tranche before market open on Dec 21.With the market capitalization of more than $500 billion, Tesla will be the largest company ever to be added to the index. Berkshire Hathaway BRK.B held the record of being the biggest company at S&P debut with $127 billion in market cap when it was included in the index in 2010. Tesla\u2019s addition to the S&P 500 will be based on the closing prices on Dec 18, coinciding with the expiration of stock options and stock futures, which should help facilitate the addition because of the high trading volume.After inclusion in the index, Tesla would be the seventh-biggest company in the S&P 500 at its current market value, falling between Berkshire Hathaway Inc. and Visa Inc. V. The Tesla stock has been on a solid run, jumping nearly 40% since Nov 16, when it was announced that Tesla would join the S&P 500 in December. With this surge, the stock is up about 580% from a year-to-date look (read: Tesla ETFs Soar on S&P 500 Inclusion News).The news has also sparked heavy trades in the stock, as money managers will adjust their portfolios to make room for shares of the $538 billion company. According to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices, Tesla\u2019s float-adjusted market value of $437 billion will lead to $72.7 billion in required trades for managers of index funds tracking the benchmark, on top of normal trading activity from Dec 21. Per the CNBC article, Goldman Sachs projects that Tesla\u2019s addition could result in $8 billion in demand from active U.S. large-cap mutual funds.According to Wall Street Journal, Tesla\u2019s addition to the S&P 500 Index has put around $100 billion worth of trade into motion as the index funds try to sell other companies\u2019 shares to buy Tesla. Wall Street estimates up to $100 billion of demand for Tesla shares from exchange trade funds and money managers that track and use the S&P 500 as a performance benchmark. In total, $11.2 trillion of investment fund assets are linked to the S&P 500.Tesla currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and a VGM Score of B. It falls under a top-ranked industry (in the top 9%).

    "url":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/nancy-pfund-investment-strategy-involves-150001892.html",
    "article_text":"(Bloomberg) -- When out in search of crazy ideas that might just change the world, Nancy Pfund\u2014founder and managing partner of DBL Partners and an early Tesla Inc. investor\u2014sometimes runs across plain-old crazy ideas. Then there was the idea behind Better Place Forests, which protects privately owned trees from becoming casualties of future development by offering them as burial sites, where loved ones\u2019 cremated remains help fertilize living, growing things. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen some unusual pitches in our time,\u201d Pfund said of her team\u2019s initial 2016 meeting with the company. \u201cAnd this one was way out there.\u201d Way out there in a great way, she added. \u201cWe were just enthralled with this notion.\u201d Better Place Forests, they realized, could be the breakthrough they were looking for. Pfund and her colleagues had identified forests as a major, untapped opportunity for entrepreneurs bent on cutting climate pollution. But until then they hadn\u2019t found an investable idea. Better Place was a golden opportunity, they thought. \u201cThis sleepy industry, that really has practices left over from the 19th century, is going through a metamorphosis,\u201d Pfund said. Plus, forest destruction drives about 10% of carbon-dioxide emissions globally. \u201cWe look at sectors and when we see a carbon impact, we go \u2018Can we change that?\u2019\u201d Pfund said. \u201cWe know that deforestation is a big contributor.\u201d At first she was afraid that DBL would \u201cbe alone with these trees,\u201d Pfund said. But \u201cit was just the opposite.\u201d Other investors joined in\u2014including True Ventures, which funded Peloton, Fitbit, and Blue Bottle Coffee, among other companies you\u2019ve probably heard of. Today, Pfund is unveiling a new initiative that incorporates her first conservation investment into a comprehensive strategy for harnessing capital to protect forests. The analysis, Forests of Innovation, is simultaneously a call-to-arms and a how-to guide for investors and businesses who want to make conservation a byproduct of things people want anyway. That could mean reinventing meaningful memorials, as Better Place Forests promises to do. It could also mean renting undeveloped land for campsites, Airbnb-style, developing new construction materials, or generating carbon credits, a.k.a. \u201coffsets\u201d because they\u2019re used to offset companies\u2019 pollution. Setting entrepreneurs to work on conservation could bring energy and creativity to a field that has historically attracted only governments and nonprofits. \u201cIn transportation,\u201d Pfund explained, \u201cthe incumbents in the field are 100 years old or more. They were optimized for generating carbon back in the last century, not reducing it.\u201d When her team set out to look at corporate strategy around conservation, however, \u201cwe could not find any corporations at all to compare,\u201d she said. \u201cThat was the light bulb that went off for us. If they aren't there, they need to be there in the 21st century.\u201d Pfund spoke to Bloomberg Green about the new Forests of Innovation report, her investment strategy and history, and her own relationship to tree-hugging. The following transcript has been edited for length and clarity. Bloomberg Green: What was meeting Better Place Forests like? Nancy Pfund: The founders of Better Place Forests walked into our conference room, and told us about how they wanted to use nature to transform the end-of-life experience for folks. It all came together. That was the a-ha moment. We found out there's been a whole move to cremation, away from burials of caskets. There were just a lot of trends that supported this approach that had nothing to do with forests. It had to do with people\u2019s attitudes towards eternity. How can you do a Tesla for forests? Is that even possible? We hoped that Tesla would help to transform the overall industry. But we we weren't counting on that. When we look at a company like Better Place Forests or some of these others, you need a portfolio out there [where] one of these is going to hit, get a loyal following, get coverage, seep into the popular culture, and become an icon in its own right, The early signs are there\u2014people are gravitating towards a more sustainable and more meaningful way to honor their loved ones. Everyone goes through this experience, and the sad part of it is the industry has not been responsive to families, to make it a better experience. [Better Place Forests] elevates something that\u2019s often diminished in the way we experience it today. That\u2019s the whole point. This does not have to be so sad. It can be uplifting and legacy-building. Are there specific things that could happen in Washington and Sacramento that would enable more conservation-minded investing? It doesn't require it. A company like Better Place Forests hasn\u2019t really benefited from any of that and it\u2019s still growing very nicely because it\u2019s tapping into consumer trends. As we\u2019ve learned in transportation and renewable energy, it does help when there are policies that reward innovation and create a framework for innovating. We mentioned in the report the U.S. Forest Service Wood Innovations Grants, the Innovative Finance for National Forests Grant Program\u2014these are tiny today. It\u2019s like when the California Energy Commission in the early 2000s wrote these teeny little grants to companies like SunPower and some of the early players. These are indicators that if you could grow these programs and get more financing for some of these embryonic efforts, then you start to create the ecosystem whereby the ones that do well go to the next stage and start to attract people like me and firms like DBL to help them scale. In the report you cite Boston Common, created in 1634, as an example of early public land protection. How relevant is that, really, today? As a society, we\u2019ve gone through centuries of approaches to nature, starting with the Boston Common example. Then you fast forward to the age of timber companies and the paper industry, where nature was more of something to conquer as opposed to something to preserve and share. That was a dominant approach for a long, long time. You saw cracks in the armor in the \u201890s to 2000 time, when people began to protest\u2014the whole tree-sitting movements that went on in the Pacific Northwest, mostly. What we\u2019re seeing now are actually coming back to the Boston Common approach. What\u2019s your own relationship with forests? Forests are a huge presence for me. The day after I graduated from college, I went to work as an intern in Washington, D.C., for the Sierra Club. One of the projects was the attempt to pass the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act, which of course is a behemoth now in terms of U.S. conservation legislation. Back then we thought it was big, but we didn\u2019t know how important it would be, and it was somewhat contentious. That opened my eyes to the role that policy can play in protecting forests and also how adversarial that job can be. But we prevailed. A lot of our work today is knitting together an attractive investment thesis with an examination of what policies will either help or hurt that thesis. Why not just pack up and move in among the trees? Like, 25 years ago, we got a weekend place up in western Sonoma County. It was an area that was heavily logged. But there was an old growth redwood on the property that had this huge burl at the bottom of the tree. And that burl protected it from being logged. So in the middle of this second-growth forest, there\u2019s this ancient growth redwood tree that just soars above everything around it. When you look up, you can\u2019t even see the top of the tree. Have you read The Overstory? It\u2019s a Pulitzer-winning novel about forests. When I hang up I'm gonna check it out. \u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P."

    "url":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/video\/tesla-won-t-disruptive-towards-144046372.html",
    "article_text":"UBS Head of Equity Derivatives Research Stuart Kaiser joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss how Tesla could impact the S&P 500 and weigh in on the auto company's overall performance this year. MYLES UDLAND: Let's talk a bit more about what's been going on in the markets of late. And joining us now for that conversation is Stuart Kaiser. He is the head of Equity Derivatives Research over at UBS. Stuart, great to talk with you this morning. I'd love to begin in the area that we don't often talk about on this show, but certainly investors are watching quite closely. And that's the VIX and the role that it plays in the market overall, the role it's certainly played during this crisis. And now with the VIX near 20, what is that-- I guess, that's a level we've been looking at, to some extent, here. Jared Blikre does the technicals for us at Yahoo Finance. What does that level, to you, mean about the state of the market as we look out to 2021? STUART KAISER: Good morning, and thanks for having me. Look, you know, the VIX getting down to 20, I think, has obviously caught a lot of headlines. I think it reflects, you know, two basic things, frankly. It's just that the markets rally pretty significantly and that realized volatility over the last couple weeks has been quite low. The point we've made, though, is that even though the VIX is at 20, the VIX futures, you know, beyond January are still around 25. So the volatility market, I think, is telling you that, you know, recently, we've had very strong market performance. But there's still a lot of underlying risk out there in the market that it's quite aware of and quite sensitive to. And until we, you know, start to see that volatility a little bit further out the curve, so in the three to six months base, start to come down, I think that means the market is still a little bit on guard. I think the positive side of that is it does suggests that there's still a little bit of risk premium out there in equity markets. So even though markets have rallied, there still could be a risk premium compression, which, all else equal, would be positive for the performance of the S&P 500, for instance. MYLES UDLAND: And then, I guess, in thinking about a return to the regime that prevailed, you know, let's call it 2017, 2018, where we had, you know, low double-digit VIX-type levels, that was really the defining feature of the market in many ways. You know, what steps would you need to see to start thinking about that as a framework for the market? Because I think, right now, you still need to be on guard for 2%, 3% moves either direction. STUART KAISER: You know, it's a great question. You know, 2017 and 2018, I think, were pretty unique from each other as well. You know, 2017 was, I think, one of the lowest volatility years we've had for the S&P 500 since-- in 50 years or so. So I think, you know, getting back to 2017 is going to be a little bit of a heavy lift. You know, 2018 might be the better comparison in the sense that volatility was low, but you still had one or two events where the market drew down pretty considerably because there was a fair amount of uncertainty in the market. And, you know, to some degree, 2021 might feel a little more like 2018, where volatility is declining in between these sort of, quote unquote, \"events,\" the market behaves very well in low volatility. But you still have some things going on. For us, 2021, at this point, you know, once we get past the Georgia runoff, which the market is pricing as a reasonably sized, you know, political event, you know, we would expect implied volatilities to decline post that event. But still further out, kind of into the second half of 2021, we still think that that risk premium or that additional kind of concern for the markets is going to be a little bit sticky and take a little while to come down. Because even though the vaccine has been announced and the efficacy rate was a huge surprise, you know, it still needs to get distributed. It still needs to be taken twice. There's still enough uncertainty out there, you know, that we think risk markets are going to be a little bit cautious. And equity investors, even though they've been very bullish the last couple of months, are still going to be, you know, just a little bit on edge in 2021, given the scar tissue and the muscle memory we've had from what's happened this year. One thing we've been highlighting, for instance, is, like, 12-month S&P 500 puts. So the cost to hedge yourself out for the next year are still exceptionally high. And that put option would generate you more than twice the S&P 500 dividend yield, for instance. And I think, in a nutshell, that shows you that even though things are much better and market dynamics are much improved, the options market is not quite as complacent, perhaps, as the price action at the index level would indicate. BRIAN SOZZI: Stuart, should investors expect really wild swings in the S&P 500 once Tesla's added? STUART KAISER: You know, our view is that, at the index level, it won't be a huge impact. We went through the process of saying, you know, what would S&P 500 realized volatility have been had Tesla been a member for the last couple of years? And frankly, the impact was, you know, 0.1 vol points. It was a very small impact. And the largest it got was less than 1 percentage point of volatility. So at the index level, we don't think it's going to be as big an impact on volatility. How it impacts sector per-- I mean, sector or index performance, though, you know, might be different than that. If you look at consumer-- the consumer discretionary sector, for instance, if you would have had Tesla as a member of that sector this year, that would have had a fairly significant impact on the realized volatility of the sector. It would have increased it by about a point and a half, and at some points, as much as 6 points. And just for reference, that's on a base of about 25. So it could have a very significant impact at the sector level. Though, we don't expect it at the S&P 500 level to be disruptive, from a volatility perspective. JULIE HYMAN: And Stuart, sort of a market mechanics question around Tesla. We keep hearing about how much money is going to move around that rebalancing. I'm curious how much is happening in advance through options. If you were seeing any of that activity on the part of institutions as they setup for that index change. STUART KAISER: It's a great question. And, you know, I've seen a lot of estimates out there in terms of the rebalancing. I think the positive news is this was pretty well flagged. You know, there was some discussion that Tesla would get added earlier in the year. And they preannounced the addition this time. So hopefully, fund managers have had enough time to at least begin to get themselves rebalanced into it. It's also been a very popular thematic stock. So you may have a lot of investors that have owned this outside of benchmark anyway. So, you know, could it be disruptive? A bit, I guess it could be. But I think, in this case, the fact that it's so well flagged and this has been such a popular, quote unquote, \"theme stock,\" hopefully, it wouldn't be so bad. From an options perspective, all of these large cap tech stocks, whether they be Google, Amazon, Tesla, Facebook, are very, very popular from an options perspective, both retail accounts as well as institutional accounts. So, you know, you've definitely seen, at periods of time, a lot of options flows into those stocks. I'm not sure if those are to rebalance or if that is just your sort of natural high volume large cap tech stuff we're seeing on the option side. So I think my answer to there would be we've probably seen a bit of it on the option side. I think we've probably seen a significant amount of it on the cash side. And if you put those two things together, hopefully, the addition later December will be a modest impact as opposed to something that's a little more disruptive, especially since that does get you pretty close to the holiday,"

    "article_text":"Image source: Tesla. Tesla posted blockbuster third-quarter results in October, and the November rally for the broader market combined with the announcement of the company's inclusion in a major index helped create conditions for another month of huge gains for the stock. Being added to the S&P 500 (or other major indexes) often creates bullish pricing momentum. When investors buy exchange-traded funds or mutual funds that track the S&P 500 index, they'll also be buying shares of Tesla. Index-tracking funds also have to buy the stock initially in order to stay current. Tesla will be added to the index before the market opens on Dec. 21. Shares likely also got a boost from positive analyst coverage last month. Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas published a note upgrading his rating on the stock from equal weight to overweight and giving a one-year price target of $540 per share on the stock -- up from his previous target of $360 per share. Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives also published a note with a rosy outlook for Tesla over the next year, citing the company's industry-leading position and expectations for a surge in overall EV demand. Tesla expects that it will deliver 500,000 cars this year, and plans for increased spending on manufacturing suggest the company anticipates strong demand.\u00a0 Tesla has continued to climb early in December's trading. The EV specialist's share price is up 2.6% in the month so far amid momentum for the broader market and news that the stock will be added to the S&P 500 index all at once instead of incrementally.\u00a0 Many EV stocks have posted stellar gains this year as investors have scrambled to capitalize on what could be an explosive, long-term growth market. Tesla is posting strong momentum, and it's not as speculatively valued as competitors Nikola, NIO, and ElectraMeccanica Vehicles, but Elon Musk's company will have to withstand increased EV pushes from automotive giants including General Motors and Ford in addition to a surge of smaller, upstart competitors. Tesla now has a market capitalization of roughly $554 billion and is valued at roughly 18 times this year's expected sales."

    "article_text":"With so much excitement on the Street for the electric-car maker, is it time to buy Tesla stock? Or has the stock's recent gain made shares overvalued? Tesla Model X. Image source: Tesla. For many companies, 2020 has been a somber year. Not so for Tesla. Quite the opposite, actually. In addition, Tesla has drastically expanded its production capacity recently. The company's annualized global production capacity has expanded from 440,000 units about a year ago to 840,000 units at the end of Q3 2020. This production capacity expansion, of course, will support growing Model 3 sales and expanded production of Tesla's new Model Y, which was introduced to Tesla's vehicle lineup earlier this year. The company's most notable recent achievement is swinging from negative cash flow in the first half of 2019 to significant positive cash flow recently. In the third quarter of 2020 alone, Tesla generated $1.4 billion of free cash flow. Of course, the market has already recognized Tesla's extraordinary momentum, driving up the stock price. This is where the major concern for investors comes in. The electric-car maker is now one of the most valuable companies in the world. Going forward, Tesla will need to demonstrate near-flawless execution on its expansion plans in order for the stock to continue rising. In addition to continuing to grow vehicle sales rapidly, Tesla will have to build out its nascent battery storage and solar business while also making significant progress in software. Over the long haul, Tesla believes its vehicles will be able to drive themselves. The company plans to fine-tune its software and beam over-the-air updates to its vehicles, enabling self-driving features. If the automaker can pull this off, Tesla could undoubtedly charge extremely high prices for the software. Indeed, Tesla has already been rapidly increasing the prices of its \"Full Self-Driving\" software package, which lets customers access enhanced driver-assist features and prepay for a potential launch of fully autonomous driving capabilities. The option currently costs $10,000, up from $5,000 as recently as May of last year.\u00a0 Since there's no guarantee Tesla will be able to roll out updates to make its vehicles fully autonomous, investors should be cautious about buying shares at this valuation. Of course, it's always possible that Tesla will deliver on its autonomous driving aspirations, building one of the world's most valuable software businesses while it's at it. Still, investors may want to look for a better entry price to leave some room for error when it comes to rosy projections for the automaker."

    "article_text":"And they'd be wise to listen. His average annual gain during that period was nearly 30%, easily outpacing the S&P 500's typical performance during that 13-year stretch. In fact, the Magellan fund beat the broad market in 11 of those 13 years. Here's a rundown of his top five nuggets of wisdom for anyone else looking to outperform the indexes. Image source: Getty Images. It's a premise that can mean a lot of different things. Is he talking about all the relevant data for one particularly company, or is Lynch referring to stocks that most investors may be overlooking? The answer is yes: both, and more. Knowing more than other investors know about any given matter better equips that investor to make well-informed decisions. It's a particularly prudent piece of wisdom right now, on the verge of not just a new U.S. president, but a major shift in how a new administration handles a ravaged economy. Many investors are understandably afraid the transition will lead to a recession. That's the wrong way of thinking, though. Sure, stocks might tank in the face of turbulence. But they may thrive instead. Nobody knows. That's the point. And even if your holdings do take a dive before or after Joe Biden takes the helm, there's never been a bear market or a recession we've not recovered from. Investors like to feel they've gotten in early on a budding trend, but it's easy to be lured into a story or a prospect that ultimately lacks substance. In this vein, be ready for the reality that competitors will at some point eat into Tesla's growth and market share. That's not going to be a big problem this year, or next. It's coming, though. Ford, General Motors, and most other major automotive names are doing serious work on EVs. Once they start to release those vehicles en masse, that's going to more or less mark the fifth inning of the EV revolution. Point being, nothing lasts forever. This one's a tough truth to swallow, particularly in recent years where the already-overwhelming 24\/7 financial news flow has turned into infotainment. Much of this programming suggests investors must \"act now\" in response to one quarterly report, or one modest product development. By the way, Peter Lynch has seen the power of patience play out in his favor many times. Perhaps the biggest payback for his discipline was served up by Lukens Steel. It gained around 500% for the Magellan fund in just one year, but it wasn't until the 15th year the fund owned the company. He's right. Most investors have (or can gain) enough knowledge to find quality names with sustainable potential, as the criteria aren't complicated. Earnings growth is easy to identify. Consumers mostly recognize the top names in any given sector. Our intuition about investment opportunities is usually on-target. The hard part is ignoring all the noise and sticking with stocks even when things look and feel grim."

Then in July, Musk confirmed that its fourth manufacturing plant would be built near Austin, Texas. That factory will be Tesla's largest, built on a 2,000-acre chunk of land. It will produce the Cybertruck and its big-rig truck called Semi, as well as the Model Y and Model 3.

    "url":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/tesla-p-500-entry-takes-110000539.html",
    "article_text":"(Bloomberg) -- The celebration that has greeted Tesla Inc.\u2019s addition to the S&P 500 has the potential to leave one of its constituencies cold: star managers who have ridden the electric-car maker\u2019s ascent to superior returns. Not many of the 215 active managers with at least $500 million in assets whose funds are indexed to the equity gauge have ventured to invest in Tesla. But the 21 who have are richer for the move. Almost 80% of them have beaten the benchmark this year with an average gain of 24%. Compare that to the 194 who didn\u2019t take the plunge. Only 28% are ahead of the index, with a smaller gain of 13%. Tesla\u2019s entry into the S&P 500 in three weeks will rob them of that edge. The carmaker will enter as a top 10 weighting with its current market-cap of nearly $550 billion, giving it sway over the most-tracked benchmark. While its addition will no doubt spark volatility as investors offload stocks of other companies to make room, it\u2019ll likely also create headaches for managers using Tesla to profit in a rough year for active investing. \u201cIt could create more of a hurdle for active managers because this is obviously a stock that\u2019s had phenomenal performance over the past few years that hasn\u2019t been included in a lot of active managers\u2019 prospective benchmarks and now will be,\u201d said Matt Bartolini, head of SPDR Americas Research at State Street Global Advisors. \u201cIf Tesla continues on its run, that could be a second-derivative of including it into the S&P 500 -- it\u2019s a more challenging environment for active managers.\u201d Tesla is up almost seven-fold this year, trouncing the S&P 500\u2019s 13% and ballooning its market cap from just $75 billion at the start of 2020. S&P Dow Jones Indices -- the index\u2019s overseer -- had considered adding the company in several steps due to its mammoth size, but announced Monday that it would include it in one shot on Dec. 21. Tesla surged 46% in November alone, largely attributable to investors piling into it ahead of forced purchases by passive funds that track the S&P 500. Those gains might not be finished , according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Large-cap core funds opting to buy Tesla at its benchmark weight would trigger purchases totaling $8 billion, strategists including Ben Snider wrote. That\u2019s 1.5% of the automaker\u2019s value. Others argue that Tesla is due for a pullback that could make it harder for the S&P 500 to move meaningfully higher. That could give managers who trail their benchmark an opportunity to catch up. \u201cIt\u2019s more of a question of whether Tesla will be a winner in the future like it has been in the past,\u201d Tim Hoyle, chief investor officer at Haverford Trust Co., said by phone. \u201cPutting stuff into an index after they\u2019ve quintupled, probably makes it easier for active managers to beat the index.\u201d While Tesla\u2019s elimination as an \u201calpha generator\u201d gets press, in certain respects the phenomenon illustrates the gulf separating mutual fund performance metrics from the real-world experience of investors. To wit: An active manager who owned the stock prior to inclusion can, obviously, keep owning it afterward, maintaining exposure to Tesla\u2019s upside. That the fund\u2019s performance will track more closely to the S&P 500 should matter little to an investor who is, say, saving money for retirement. Still, for managers looking to post benchmark-beating returns in hopes of attracting new clients, Tesla\u2019s addition makes that marginally more difficult. \u201cStock selection is obviously a big part of it, and owning Tesla, an outside of a benchmark name was one way,\u201d SSGA\u2019s Bartolini said. \u201cBut going forward, it\u2019s going to be trickier.\u201d \u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P."

    "url":"https:\/\/www.investors.com\/research\/gm-stock-buy-now\/?src=A00220",
    "article_text":"GM stock, after going nowhere for nearly a decade, is driving in the fast lane as Wall Street gains confidence in its EV potential. Last week, GM stock dashed to the cusp of an all-time high. While it's still unclear how far GM stock can go on this charge, this week's stock action looks promising. GM stock dodged a pothole with its scaled-back Nikola deal and already seems to have regained traction. GM's new Ultium battery-powered 2022 Hummer EV sold out minutes after its unveiling in October. Its Cruise self-driving vehicle unit recently got the go-ahead for a groundbreaking tryout in San Francisco. While GM's revised deal to supply fuel cells for Nikola heavy-duty trucks has lower voltage than first thought, all of GM's big future bets are showing promise. On Nov. 19, GM mapped out its road to topping its prior goal of one million EV sales by 2025 and achieving big EV battery cost-reductions and efficiency gains. So is now a good time to buy GM stock? On Sept. 8, General Motors and Nikola announced a partnership that would see the top U.S. automaker build several versions of Nikola's Badger pickup truck using GM's own fuel cell technology and Ultium EV battery. GM also agreed to supply fuel cells to Nikola's heavy-duty trucks, expanding GM's market opportunity. In exchange for the services it provides, GM was supposed to receive $2 billion worth of Nikola stock. Yet the deal almost immediately came under fire, and Nikola's stock dived as its founder left the company amid allegations of being a huckster and personal misconduct. The revised terms revealed Nov. 30 suggest that GM had an earlier lapse in judgment. Now, GM won't put its own capital on the line in exchange for NKLA stock, and the Badger won't be built. The reshaped deal \"somewhat lowers confidence in Nikola's longer-term outlook, and therefore GM\u00b4s ability to eventually monetize its fuel-cell technology,\" wrote Deutsche Bank analyst Emmanuel Rosner. The lack of a big negative reaction for GM stock suggests that investors see General Motors fuel-cell ambitions as gravy, not the main dish. But the potential remains intriguing. On Oct. 21, GM President Mark Reuss told CNBC, \"The opportunity to put our fuel cells into a class 7 and 8 vehicle is spectacular,\" he told CNBC on Oct. 21.\" While GM earnings shifted into overdrive in Q3, those earnings come from sales of vehicles with internal combustion engines. That's a business which Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas describes as a \"melting ice cube,\" destined for a long-term decline. Wall Street analysts have argued in recent months that GM should spin off its Ultium electric vehicle operations to get a more proper valuation. Deutsche Bank's Rosner had said that a spinoff of EV operations could fetch a value of $20 billion to $100 billion, while easing access to capital and top talent. Yet GM CEO Mary Barra killed that idea at the Nov. 19 Barclays Global Automotive Conference. \"Our integrated strategy is a competitive advantage for GM.\" Barra said GM will realize $2 billion in cost efficiencies from shared engineering, manufacturing, marketing and corporate cost. Cash flow from GM operations will fund an accelerated $7 billion in EV investment through 2025, while still allowing General Motors to reinstate its dividend in 2021. \"We're committed to fighting for EV market share until we are number one in North America, achieving margins similar to or higher than our ICE business and exceeding our previous target of selling one million vehicles globally by mid-decade. On Oct. 16, GM stock first nosed its grille into buy range, clearing a buy point at 33.43, 10 cents above its Sept. 8 high. Then, on Oct. 20, ahead of that night's highly anticipated Hummer EV launch, General Motors announced that a third U.S. factory would be switched to making electric vehicles. GM stock shifted into high gear. The stock advanced 6.75% to 35.60, clearing the 5% chase zone beyond which stock purchases carry higher risk. The momentum has continued. GM stock rose as high as 46.71 on Tuesday, Nov. 24, just below its October 2017 all-time high of 46.76. General Motors earnings haven't seen steady growth in the past couple of years, as auto sales peaked in the U.S. and hit a pothole in China. A UAW strike hurt results in the second half 2019. Then Covid-19 marred the first half of 2020. But in Q3, everything seemed to fall into place. General Motors earnings per share surged 65% to $2.83, as GM \"showcased the benefit from its deep structural cost reductions,\" Rosner said. Revenue of $35.5 billion was flat from a year ago and in line with estimates. In the third quarter, GM deliveries in the U.S. recovered to 665,192 vs. 492,489 amid the coronavirus lockdown in Q2. Deliveries still fell 10% from a year ago, but GM said each month saw improvement, and September sales exceeded the year-ago total. GM restarted factories on May 18 after a two-month coronavirus suspension. Lean inventories have held back sales, but GM has said that large pickup and full-size SUV plants are now all operating on three shifts and at maximum overtime. With cheap oil prices, General Motors appears well-positioned in the U.S. market, seeing demand for pickup trucks and crossover SUVs. Now sales in China also are on the upswing. General Motors and its Chinese joint-venture partners saw deliveries rise 12% to 771,400. GM sales outpaced the Chinese market as a whole, a nice turnaround from Q2, when deliveries fell 5% as China's market grew 10%. GM unveiled the Hummer EV truck during the World Series, touting \"maneuverability and traction unlike anything GM has ever offered.\" The Hummer's CrabWalk mode, allowing it to move diagonally to get through tight off-road spots, quickly went viral. \"I think investors are crab-walking back to the stock,\" Morgan Stanley's Adam Jonas said on an Oct. 21 analyst call with management. Prices for the initial Hummer EV version start at $112,595. General Motors said all available reservations for the Hummer EV sold out within 10 minutes, but didn't detail how many refundable $100 deposits it accepted. GM plans cheaper Hummer EV versions in future years. GM had a puzzle to solve: How could it compete broadly in the still relatively small EV market, en route to an all-electric future, without frittering away its financial strength? The answer came with the March 4 unveiling of its Ultium battery and flexible platform. The Ultium stands apart for its ability to be stacked either vertically or horizontally in the battery pack, to optimize the layout of each vehicle. The biggest stack is said to have the power to reach 400 miles on a full charge. The platform can accommodate a wide range of trucks, SUVs and cars. CEO Mary Barra has said that GM's multisegment EV strategy has \"economies of scale that rival our full-size truck business with much less complexity and even more flexibility.\" The first generation of GM's coming EV lineup \"will be profitable,\" the company said.\u00a0Since then, GM has detailed a much more complete vision of its EV future. In September,\u00a0GM unveiled its strategy to produce electric drive systems that are designed in-house to deliver cost and performance benefits. GM says the five drive units and three motors will offer the power and versatility to work with the full range of some 20 different EVs it plans to produce by 2023. GM said these Ultium Drive systems \"will be more responsive than its internal combustion equivalents with precision torque control of its motors for smooth performance.\" The Honda deal created a partnership model that the Nikola deal could follow. Barra said that supplying GM technology to rival automakers would build \"scale to lower battery and fuel cell costs and increase profitability.\" Now GM is highlighting progress in testing its next-generation Ultium battery chemistry. \"We believe we are on the battery-cost frontier today and we intend to set the pace for the future,\" said GM product development chief Doug Parks. In January, General Motors unveiled its six-passenger Cruise Origin, which has no steering wheel. But the company laid off 8% of its workforce in May as it paced itself for a future that is still just over the horizon. Cruise had hoped to launch a robotaxi service in San Francisco late in 2019. GM and others were too optimistic about how fast they could solve what Barra has called \"the greatest engineering challenge of our lifetime.\" She's remains optimistic about unlocking \"the multitrillion-dollar market potential\" of self-driving cars, though some experts now think that market might not develop until late this decade. Yet even GM's Cruise venture has started generating some excitement. In October, the company received the first permit to test its driverless cars without a backup driver on the streets of San Francisco. \"We'll be the first doing it in a complex urban environment,\" Barra said on the Q3 call. \"And why that's so important is, if you think about even today's ride sharing, the opportunity for profitability is in dense urban environments.\" GM bought Cruise Automation for $1.1 billion in 2016. Key investors include Honda, which in 2018 put $750 million into the venture and agreed to put up $2 billion more over 12 years. Tesla, meanwhile, has released a new Full Self Driving beta version to select drivers. But despite the name, Tesla FSD is still a Level 2, hands-on system, while Cruise and Waymo are Level 4. Because GM's traditional business faces a long-term decline, and it's been through a restructuring, fundamental metrics don't tell the full story. Undoubtedly, there is lots of execution risk and uncertainty, but Wall Street sees plenty of promise developing. If analysts see GM as a \"stable of unicorns\" with high-growth potential, as Morgan Stanley's Jonas has said, they could begin to use a more flattering lens for valuing future earnings. However, there's no indication that GM will spin off its EV operations. GM joint ventures in China could be hurt if U.S.-China tensions grow. GM Cruise could turn out to be a robotaxi leader, but don't hold your breath. The biggest uncertainty may be GM's ability to compete with Tesla, which aims to drive down the price of its EVs to $25,000 in three years. The clearest immediate reason to steer clear of GM stock is that it has advanced well beyond the chase zone since its Oct. 16 breakout. Bottom line: Investors intrigued by GM's EV future should be patient. GM is not in a proper buy zone. YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:"

Other companies looking to capitalize on the ESG trend: In 2017, BlackRock underwent a major shift in its investment strategy, prioritizing stocks with high ESG ratings. BlackRock\u2019s focus on technology and sustainability has fueled the new trend in the marketplace, pushing even more investors to consciously consider where they put their money. Blackrock\u2019s holdings speak for themselves. In fact, its top investments include sustainability giants like Apple, Microsoft, Google and Facebook. It\u2019s also a major shareholder in Tesla and Next Era Energy, two of the leading renewable-focused firms on the market. Microsoft has built hardware and software to help monitor and better understand the effect of different institutions have on the planet, gathering data to better figure out how companies and people can improve. The company is creating tools to better handle the b the world\u2019s growing waste crisis. Other tech giants are getting involved, as well. Both Facebook and Google have embarked on similar paths to Microsoft, with massive business-wide changes with the goal of becoming leaders in the sustainability space. Its focus is on raising the bar for smarter and more efficient use of the world\u2019s limited resources. It is building sustainable, energy-efficient data centers and workplaces. It is also harnessing artificial intelligence to utilize energy more efficiently. Its bid to reduce its carbon footprint has been well received by both younger and older investors. And as the need to slow down climate change becomes increasingly dire, it\u2019s easy to see why.\u00a0\u00a0 Facebook has even gone a step further with its focus on building more sustainable workplaces. It\u2019s building designs incorporate a number of renewable energy sources and water recycling methods, in addition to promoting the recycling and sustainability of all products consumed on site. After his passing, Tim Cook took these principles to heart, and picked up the torch, transforming all of Apple\u2019s operations into models of a sustainable future. Now, all of Apple\u2019s operations run on 100% renewable energy. \"We proved that 100 percent renewable is 100 percent doable. All our facilities worldwide\u2014including Apple offices, retail stores, and data centers\u2014are now powered entirely by clean energy. But this is just the beginning of how we\u2019re reducing greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to climate change. We\u2019re continuing to go further than most companies in measuring our carbon footprint, including manufacturing and product use. And we\u2019re making great progress in those areas too,\" CEO Tim Cook explained. And it\u2019s already having an impact. Not only have they decreased their average product\u2019s energy use by 70 percent. They\u2019ve reduced their total carbon footprint by more than 35 percent in just a few short years. All while securing the title as the World\u2019s First Trillion Dollar Company. Canadian companies are riding this trend, as well: NFI Group (TSX:NFI) NFI Group is another one of Canada\u2019s electric vehicle pioneers producing transit busses and motorcycles. The company had a tough go at it towards the beginning of the year, but has since cut its debt and begun to address its cash flow struggles in a meaningful way. Though it remains down from January highs, NFI still offers investors a promising opportunity to capitalize on the electric vehicle boom. In the previous months, NFI has seen an uptick in insider stock purchases which is often a sign that the board and management strongly believe in the future of the company. In addition to its increasingly positive financial reports, it is also one of the few in the business that actually pay dividends out to its investors.\u00a0 GreenPower Motor (TSX:GPV) GreenPower Motor is a promising young electric bus manufacturer. Currently, its focus is primarily on the North American market, but it has plenty of room to grow as the industry takes off. Founded over a decade ago, GreenPower has been on the frontlines of the electric movement, manufacturing affordable battery-electric busses and trucks. From school busses to long-distance public transit, GreenPower\u2019s impact on the sector can\u2019t be ignored. Year-to-date, GreenPower Motor has seen its share price soar from $2.03 to $24.45. That means investors have seen 1104% gains this year alone. And with this red-hot sector only going up, GreenPower will likely continue to impress.\u00a0\u00a0 Shopify Inc (TSX:SH) Shopify is a rapidly-expanding tech giant in the e-commerce sector. It\u2019s already got over 1 million businesses using its platform, including Budweiser, Tesla and Red Bull. Shopify has revolutionized the e-commerce world, allowing anyone, even if they do not know how to code, build and deploy an e-commerce website. And it\u2019s not without its ethical grounding, either. Shopify is pushing towards sustainability in a major way. It has started its own sustainability fund, which it adds $5 million to each year to help tackle the looming climate crisis. Shaw Communications Inc (TSE:SJR.B) Shaw is one of Canada\u2019s leading telecom infrastructure and cloud service providers. Its dominance in Canada\u2019s telecom sector means that if any internet-based services want to operate, they\u2019ll likely be utilizing the company\u2019s infrastructure. After all, without telecoms, these TaaS companies would not be able to operate. And that\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing when you consider Shaw\u2019s sustainability goals. In fact, it is one of the biggest customers of Bullfrog Power which sources its electricity from a blend of wind energy and hydropower. It is also building its own portfolio of clean energy investments. BCE Inc. (TSX:BCE)  BCE is another household name in Canadian telecom. Throughout its push into the position of one of Canada\u2019s top telco groups, it has bought and sold a number of different firms. BCE is currently at the forefront of the Internet of Things movement in Canada. That means it will play a vital role in building new sustainability projects and making Canada\u2019s cities smarter and more efficient. Likewise, it will play a key role in the adoption of transportation technologies and self-driving vehicles. By. Glen Carrick **IMPORTANT! BY READING OUR CONTENT YOU EXPLICITLY AGREE TO THE FOLLOWING.

    "url":"https:\/\/www.investors.com\/news\/tesla-stock-rises-sp-500-index-tesla-cybertruck-deliveries-2022\/?src=A00220",
    "article_text":"Tesla stock rallied on news that TSLA stock will be added to the S&P 500 index in one fell swoop on Dec. 21. Meanwhile, the electric car maker pushed back on its Cybertruck timeline, saying that deliveries won't start until early 2022. S&P Dow Jones Indices officials said it consulted investors about how Tesla stock would be added to the index. The automaker has a market capitalization of more than $500 billion, making it the largest company ever to be added to the index. S&P Dow Jones mulled adding Tesla stock\u00a0 in two tranches to ease integration. But the committee decided to add the stock all at once at its full float-adjusted market cap before the open of trading on Dec. 21. That means they will weight the company based only on shares available to the public. \"The fact the S&P Dow Jones Index Committee solicited feedback from the investment community about how to add the stock to the S&P 500 Index shows how unusual this situation is,\" said CFRA Research senior analyst Gerrett Nelson in a note. In its decision, S&P DJI considered also Tesla's expected liquidity and the market's ability to accommodate significant trading volumes. \"Adding the stock at the upcoming December quarterly rebalancing coincides with the expiration of stock options, stock futures, stock-index options and stock-index futures, which may help facilitate the funding trade,\" the index provider said in a news release. Tesla's addition to the S&P 500 will be based on the closing prices of Friday, Dec. 18. The company that Tesla will replace will be named after the market closes on Dec. 11. Analyst Nelson says the move to the S&P 500 will spark a flurry of funding trades in Tesla Stock. Its inclusion means investment funds indexed to the S&P 500 will have to sell about $51 billion worth of shares of companies already in the S&P 500 and use that money to buy shares of Tesla, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. Tesla will account for about 1% of the index. In addition, actively managed investment funds that try to beat the S&P 500 may buy more Tesla shares, too. Such funds manage trillions of dollars in assets. \"We expect TSLA shares to continue to get bid up over the next few weeks as funds are forced to add the stock, which we think will result in multiple expansion and a further widening of its cost of capital advantage relative to other automakers,\" Nelson said. Tesla is pitching Cybertruck reservation holders on leasing another Tesla vehicle as the company tries to hit 500,000 deliveries. Notably, Tesla explicitly said Cybertruck deliveries won't begin until early 2022, later than official targets for a late 2021 launch. \"The single motor configuration is currently scheduled to begin production in late 2022 with delivery projected to take place in early 2023,\" Tesla said in the email to Cybertruck reservation holders. \"The dual and tri-motor configurations are currently scheduled to begin production in late 2021 with delivery projected to take place in early 2022.\" Pitching 24-36 month leases to reservation holders is another indication of how long it might be before Cybertruck deliveries get going. CEO Elon Musk had hinted that the Cybertruck wouldn't come until 2022 because it needs future battery improvements. Also, the electric still doesn't have a final, street-legal design. That might come in the next several weeks. The Tesla Cybertruck will be made at a new plant outside Austin, Texas. That plant, due to be up and running in late 2021, will also make the Model Y and upcoming Tesla Semi. The long-touted Semi also may need future battery improvements. Musk once again pushed back his timeline for Tesla achieving fully autonomous vehicles. In Tuesday remarks after receiving an award, \"I am extremely confident of achieving full autonomy and releasing it to the Tesla customer base next year.\" Of course, that could mean that Tesla will release \"full autonomy\" capability to drivers by Jan. 1,\u00a0 but Musk has been saying for years that Tesla is on the cusp of doing so. He had been saying until recently that full autonomy could be reach before the end of 2020. Tesla recently released FSD Beta, a revised Full Self Driving offering, to a limited number of Tesla drivers. However, videos posted by these drivers show the need for frequent human intervention. Most autonomous driving experts say that Tesla FSD is still a Level 2 system, with a long way to go to achieve full autonomy, especially given its current hardware. In a new email to employees Tuesday, Elon Musk said Tesla needs to control costs better to achieve future profits already baked into the stock price. \"When looking at our actual profitability, it is very low at around 1% for the past year. Investors are giving us a lot of credit for future profits, but if, at any point, they conclude that's not going to happen, our stock will immediately get crushed like a souffl\u00e9 under a sledgehammer!\" On Monday, Tesla stock set a record high at 607.80 before reversing lower. Analyst Nelson remains bullish on TSLA stock. \"The ongoing run-up means that TSLA's cost of capital advantage relative to peers continues to widen,\" he said. This is key because Tesla continues to build new factories and deliver on its goal of increasing annual auto volumes by 40 times over the next decade from about 500,000 units this year to 20 million by 2030, he added.

    "article_text":"Elon Musk would consider leveraging Tesla's mega $554 billion market cap to buy a legacy automaker, but only if it was on friendly terms, the billionaire entrepreneur said Tuesday in a wide-ranging interview with Axel Springer CEO Mathias D\u00f6pfner. Musk, who received an award Tuesday from the media giant, discussed his various interests and businesses, notably SpaceX and Tesla, both of which he leads. D\u00f6pfner noted that Tesla's valuation far exceeds the market cap of incumbent automakers like BMW, Daimler and VW, which along with others in the industry once dismissed Musk's ability to make electric vehicles mainstream. When asked if it would be a serious option to buy one of the legacy automakers, Musk said it was possible, but only under certain conditions. \"Well, I think we're definitely not going to launch a hostile takeover,\" Musk said. \"So I suppose if there was a friendly one, if somebody said, 'Hey, we think it would be a good idea to merge with Tesla,' we certainly could have that conversation. But, you know, we don't want it to be a hostile takeover sort of situation.\" Tesla today sits in an enviable position \u2014 although Musk said once again that its share price is too high. The company, which will join the S&P 500 Index on December 21, is now the most valuable automaker in the world, surpassing rivals that produce far more vehicles annually. Investors have sunk money into Tesla shares largely because they view it more as a technology company than an automaker, even though the vast majority of its revenues today come from car sales. Musk noted that automakers largely dismissed Tesla in its early days. \"When we first unveiled the Roadster in 2007, I mean, it was just basically, they just said, 'Oh, well, you're basically a bunch of fools,' \" Musk remarked, adding that rivals are now far friendlier than in the past."

The bipartisan bill was crafted by a group that included Republicans Senators Mitt Romney and Susan Collins, as well as Democratic Senators Joe Manchin and Mark Warner, amid an ongoing stalemate. Provisions included $288 billion for small-business relief, $16 billion for the distribution of a coronavirus vaccine and $82 billion for schools.

Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk warned in an internal email his company\u2019s rallying shares could get \u201ccrushed\u201d if investors start to worry about the electric-car manufacturer\u2019s ability to deliver on profit expectations. Musk urged employees to stay focused on cutting costs and prevent a reversal in Tesla\u2019s soaring stock price in an email sent Tuesday to employees as the Palo Alto, California-based company works to meet a target of delivering half a million cars this year. \u201cWhen looking at our actual profitability, it is very low at around 1% for the past year. Investors are giving us a lot of credit for future profitability, but if, at any point, they conclude that\u2019s not going to happen, our stock will immediately get crushed like a souffle under a sledgehammer!\u201d Musk wrote in the email viewed by Bloomberg News. Tesla did not respond to a request for comment. The carmaker\u2019s stock has skyrocketed almost 600% this year, in part on expectations it could join the S&P 500 Index -- it will on Dec. 21 -- and also helped by the fifth consecutive quarter of profit posted in October. Musk and Chief Financial Officer Zachary Kirkhorn have been focused on cost reductions for several quarters even as Tesla spends billions on new factories in Austin, Texas, and near Berlin to expand its global production and sales footprint. \u201cAt a time like this, when our stock is reaching new heights, it may seem as though spending carefully is not as important. This is definitely not true!\u201d Musk wrote in the email. No Hostile Takeovers Vehicle affordability is an issue the CEO has become increasingly concerned about as Tesla\u2019s sales volumes grow beyond its onetime niche status. Musk has said he would be willing to sacrifice profitability to sell more and cheaper cars, and he has promised to launch a $25,000 model by 2023. Tesla\u2019s cheapest vehicle currently is the Model 3, which starts at $37,990. \u201cMuch more important, in order to make our cars affordable, we have to get smarter about how we spend money,\u201d wrote Musk. \u201cThis is a tough Game of Pennies, requiring thousands of good ideas to improve part cost, a factory process or simplify the design, while increasing quality and capabilities. A great idea would be one that saves $5, but the vast majority are $0.50 here or $0.20 there.\u201d Musk was in Berlin Tuesday, where he received an innovation award from German publisher Axel Springer SE. The prize that has been given to other billionaire American entrepreneurs including Amazon.com Inc. CEO Jeff Bezos and Facebook Inc. CEO Mark Zuckerberg. When asked at the award ceremony if Tesla would consider buying another automaker, Musk declined to rule it out but said any future deal would have to be mutually agreeable. \u201cWe\u2019re definitely not going to launch a hostile takeover,\u201d he said. \u201cIf somebody said, hey, we think it would be a good idea to merge with Tesla, we\u2019d certainly have that conversation.\u201d Tesla is building its first European factory near the German capital in a major attack on the country\u2019s auto establishment. Musk, who is pushing to get the project up and running by July, said he would spend the night in a conference room in the unfinished factory. \u201cWhen we have the opening for Giga Berlin we\u2019re gonna have just a big party,\u201d he said.

    "article_text":"(Bloomberg) -- Tesla Inc. climbed on Tuesday as investors braced for the company\u2019s addition to the S&P 500 in one shot on Dec. 21, a move that\u2019s expected to spur as much as $70 billion worth of passive-fund flows. At $550 billion, Tesla\u2019s market capitalization is more than any other company had at its debut in the benchmark gauge. Given that size, the index provider had considered adding Tesla in two tranches to limit the potential for disruption as money managers adjust their portfolios to make room for stock. Estimates on what the demand for Tesla shares will be among S&P 500 index fund managers from Vanguard Group Inc. to State Street Global Advisors range from 99 million to 120 million. The average total share volume of U.S. equities this year has been about 11 billion. The stock closed at $584.76 on Tuesday, potentially putting as much as $70 billion of trades in play, according to Bloomberg calculations. \u201cThe notional amount is a lot on a headline basis, but in this sort of market environment, not sure it matters,\u201d said Andrew Ross, managing member of Confluence Global Capital, an event-driven hedge fund. \u201cYou obviously see an impact on the stock being added, but beyond that, impact tends to be very limited.\u201d Tesla would be among the 10 biggest companies in the S&P 500 at its current market value. Berkshire Hathaway held the record of being the biggest company at S&P debut, and was worth about $127 billion when it was included in the index in 2010. \u201cThere\u2019s always going to be front-running by the non-index funds who are going to buy Tesla in anticipation of the index funds having to buy the stock on the rebalance,\u201d said Dan Russo, chief market strategist at Chaikin Analytics. \u201cAfter it\u2019s added and all the index funds have bought their allocation, it probably becomes a sell-the-news event. I\u2019m more interested in seeing which stocks get displaced to the downside as managers make room for Tesla.\u201d Read more: Tesla FOMO Fires Up Wall Street\u2019s $300 Billion Custom-Index Boom Highly Volatile Tesla has been among the most volatile U.S. stocks in recent years. If that pattern continues after its inclusion in the S&P 500, it could trickle over into investment products tied to the Cboe Volatility Index. \u201cMathematically, it\u2019s got to increase volatility,\u201d said Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers. Using simple algebra, the addition would push the S&P 500\u2019s volatility about half to three-quarters of a point higher, which would then feed into the VIX, he said. While demand from fund managers will almost certainly continue to drive up Tesla shares in the coming weeks, the shares are likely to pull back shortly after its inclusion in the S&P 500, according to Sosnick. \u201cIt\u2019s reasonable to expect that when it goes into the index, it will be at the end of a spike, and it\u2019s reasonable to expect that it gives back some of that spike,\u201d he said. S&P Dow Jones Indices, in announcing the plan in a brief statement Monday, said it will make public on Dec. 11 which company Tesla will replace in the index.

Investors stayed focused on updates about a handful of vaccine candidates and the start of global shipments as drugmakers submit paperwork for regulatory approvals. Pfizer Inc jumped almost 3% after the drugmaker and Germany's BioNTech SE sought emergency approval of their vaccine candidate from the European regulator. The partners are neck-and-neck with rival Moderna Inc , which also applied for emergency approval from the European regulator. Its stock tumbled nearly 8% from a record high the day before. \"There is this optimism about what it means as we see news around vaccines emerge,\" said Bill Northey, senior investment director at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Minneapolis. \"As we look toward a health solution, we could be sitting on a coiled spring of economic activity, but it could take a while for it to be unleashed.\" Earlier in the day, global equities got a boost from data that showed China's factory activity in November increased at its fastest pace in a decade. Several other countries also reported sharp upticks in factory activity. U.S. data showed a recovery in manufacturing activity lost momentum in November. All 11 S&P 500 sector indexes rose, with communication services up 2% and leading gains. Investors also focused on remarks by U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell at the Senate Banking Committee, where they agreed on the need for more aid for small businesses. Meanwhile, a bipartisan group of U.S. lawmakers unveiled a $908 billion COVID-19 relief bill aimed at breaking a months-long deadlock between Democrats and Republicans over new emergency assistance for small businesses, unemployed people, airlines and other industries during the pandemic. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.63% to end at 29,823.92 points, while the S&P 500 gained 1.13% at 3,662.44. The Nasdaq Composite climbed 1.28% to 12,355.11. All three main stock indexes gained more than 10% in November. Zoom Video Communications Inc slumped 15% after warning its gross margins would remain under pressure going into 2021. Tesla Inc rose 3% after S&P Dow Jones Indices said it would add one of Wall Street's most valuable companies to the S&P 500 index in one go on Dec. 21, rather than in two tranches. Micron Technology Inc advanced 4.7% as the chipmaker increased its revenue, gross margin and earnings forecast for the first quarter. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by a 2.45-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.38-to-1 ratio favored advancers. The S&P 500 posted 48 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 185 new highs and eight new lows. Volume on U.S. exchanges was 13.5 billion shares, compared with the 11.5 billion average over the last 20 trading days.

    "article_text":"Convertible securities are having an impressive 2020, with a major index up 36% through the end of November, making the hybrid securities one of the top-performing U.S. asset classes this year. Then there is the Tesla factor. Its largest convertible issue, a 2% bond due in 2024, has risen more than sixfold to a price of $938\u2014its face value is $100. Tesla stock is up sevenfold to $580. Michael Youngworth, head of global convertible strategy at Bank of America Securities, says the strength in convertibles has been driven by the \u201casymmetric\u201d nature of the market. \u201cConvertibles capture more return on the upside than on the downside,\u201d he says.  This reflects the nature of the securities, which offer the security of a bond and the upside of a stock. Investors give up some appreciation potential relative to stocks with convertibles but converts can still generate big returns as Tesla has demonstrated. U.S. convertible issuance through November has totaled $96.6 billion, according to Youngworth, nearly double the $53 billion in all of 2019 and the highest issuance total since 2001. Convertible returns are the highest since 2009, and the market is easily topping the S&P 500 index, which was up 14% year-to-date through Monday and the junk-bond market, which has gained 4.2% through the end of November.  King says it will be difficult for the convertible market to maintain its outsize 2020 performance, but he isn\u2019t bearish. \u201cInvestors have been wanting new income and growth securities and the near-record new issuance has been easily absorbed,\u201d he says. \u201cThe universe weight of Tesla should start declining in an orderly fashion, with the first of its three converts maturing next March and the second one in 2022. New issuance pricing has been impacted by low interest rates but has been appropriate with this factor considered. There could well be frothiness within our underlying equities but I don\u2019t see it in the convertible securities themselves.\u201d"

    "article_text":"Tesla stock rallied on news that TSLA stock will be added to the S&P 500 index in one fell swoop on Dec. 21. Meanwhile, the electric car maker pushed back on its Cybertruck timeline, saying that deliveries won't start until early 2022. S&P Dow Jones Indices officials said it consulted investors about how Tesla stock would be added to the index. The automaker has a market capitalization of more than $500 billion, making it the largest company ever to be added to the index. S&P Dow Jones mulled adding Tesla stock\u00a0 in two tranches to ease integration. But the committee decided to add the stock all at once at its full float-adjusted market cap before the open of trading on Dec. 21. That means they will weight the company based only on shares available to the public. \"The fact the S&P Dow Jones Index Committee solicited feedback from the investment community about how to add the stock to the S&P 500 Index shows how unusual this situation is,\" said CFRA Research senior analyst Gerrett Nelson in a note. In its decision, S&P DJI considered also Tesla's expected liquidity and the market's ability to accommodate significant trading volumes. \"Adding the stock at the upcoming December quarterly rebalancing coincides with the expiration of stock options, stock futures, stock-index options and stock-index futures, which may help facilitate the funding trade,\" the index provider said in a news release. Tesla's addition to the S&P 500 will be based on the closing prices of Friday, Dec. 18. The company that Tesla will replace will be named after the market closes on Dec. 11. Analyst Nelson says the move to the S&P 500 will spark a flurry of funding trades in Tesla Stock. Its inclusion means investment funds indexed to the S&P 500 will have to sell about $51 billion worth of shares of companies already in the S&P 500 and use that money to buy shares of Tesla, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. Tesla will account for about 1% of the index. In addition, actively managed investment funds that try to beat the S&P 500 may buy more Tesla shares, too. Such funds manage trillions of dollars in assets. \"We expect TSLA shares to continue to get bid up over the next few weeks as funds are forced to add the stock, which we think will result in multiple expansion and a further widening of its cost of capital advantage relative to other automakers,\" Nelson said. Tesla is pitching Cybertruck reservation holders on leasing another Tesla vehicle as the company tries to hit 500,000 deliveries. Notably, Tesla explicitly said Cybertruck deliveries won't begin until early 2022, later than official targets for a late 2021 launch. \"The single motor configuration is currently scheduled to begin production in late 2022 with delivery projected to take place in early 2023,\" Tesla said in the email to Cybertruck reservation holders. \"The dual and tri-motor configurations are currently scheduled to begin production in late 2021 with delivery projected to take place in early 2022.\" Pitching 24-36 month leases to reservation holders is another indication of how long it might be before Cybertruck deliveries get going. CEO Elon Musk had hinted that the Cybertruck wouldn't come until 2022 because it needs future battery improvements. Also, the electric still doesn't have a final, street-legal design. That might come in the next several weeks. The Tesla Cybertruck will be made at a new plant outside Austin, Texas. That plant, due to be up and running in late 2021, will also make the Model Y and upcoming Tesla Semi. The long-touted Semi also may need future battery improvements. Musk once again pushed back his timeline for Tesla achieving fully autonomous vehicles. In Tuesday remarks after receiving an award, \"I am extremely confident of achieving full autonomy and releasing it to the Tesla customer base next year.\" Of course, that could mean that Tesla will release \"full autonomy\" capability to drivers by Jan. 1,\u00a0 but Musk has been saying for years that Tesla is on the cusp of doing so. He had been saying until recently that full autonomy could be reach before the end of 2020. Tesla recently released FSD Beta, a revised Full Self Driving offering, to a limited number of Tesla drivers. However, videos posted by these drivers show the need for frequent human intervention. Most autonomous driving experts say that Tesla FSD is still a Level 2 system, with a long way to go to achieve full autonomy, especially given its current hardware. In a new email to employees Tuesday, Elon Musk said Tesla needs to control costs better to achieve future profits already baked into the stock price. \"When looking at our actual profitability, it is very low at around 1% for the past year. Investors are giving us a lot of credit for future profits, but if, at any point, they conclude that's not going to happen, our stock will immediately get crushed like a souffl\u00e9 under a sledgehammer!\" On Monday, Tesla stock set a record high at 607.80 before reversing lower. Analyst Nelson remains bullish on TSLA stock. \"The ongoing run-up means that TSLA's cost of capital advantage relative to peers continues to widen,\" he said. This is key because Tesla continues to build new factories and deliver on its goal of increasing annual auto volumes by 40 times over the next decade from about 500,000 units this year to 20 million by 2030, he added.

    "article_text":"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk said on Tuesday that electricity consumption will double if the world's car fleets are electrified, increasing the need to expand nuclear, solar, geothermal and wind energy generating sources. Increasing the availability of sustainable energy is a major challenge as cars move from combustion engines to battery-driven electric motors, a shift which will take two decades, Musk said in a talk hosted by Berlin-based publisher Axel Springer. \"It will take another 20 years for cars to be fully electric. It is like with phones, you cannot replace them all at once,\" Musk said in a talk streamed on the Bild.de web site, adding that around 5% of vehicles are replaced every year. Once electric cars become the norm, electricity from intermittent generating energy sources such as wind and solar will need to be stored, probably through battery technology, he said. \"Together with large battery packs, both things need to be combined, wind power with battery packs and solar energy,\" Musk said.

    "article_text":"FRANKFURT, Dec 1 (Reuters) - Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk said on Tuesday that electricity consumption will double if the world's car fleets are electrified, increasing the need to expand nuclear, solar, geothermal and wind energy generating sources. Increasing the availability of sustainable energy is a major challenge as cars move from combustion engines to battery-driven electric motors, a shift which will take two decades, Musk said in a talk hosted by Berlin-based publisher Axel Springer. \"It will take another 20 years for cars to be fully electric. It is like with phones, you cannot replace them all at once,\" Musk said in a talk streamed on the Bild.de web site, adding that around 5% of vehicles are replaced every year. Once electric cars become the norm, electricity from intermittent generating energy sources such as wind and solar will need to be stored, probably through battery technology, he said. \"Together with large battery packs, both things need to be combined, wind power with battery packs and solar energy,\" Musk said.

    "article_text":"Tesla shares were higher on Tuesday after S&P Dow Jones Indices announced late Monday it would be added to the S&P 500 index all at once on Dec. 21. MYLES UDLAND: All right. A company we also talk quite a bit about here on Yahoo Finance is Tesla. They're set to join the S&P 500 to begin trading on December 21. A rebalance will happen on Friday, December 18. And Julie Hyman, this is going to be the largest rebalance that-- or the largest requirement of trading volume that has ever happened for a company entering the S&P. And as we discussed back when the news was initially announced that they'd be joining, they are going to be what? The tenth largest, ninth largest company within the index upon inclusion. JULIE HYMAN: Yeah, I think they've actually moved up by now, Myles. I think they're something like seven or eight at this point. I was looking at the numbers from Howard Silverblatt over at S&P, which he sent after the decision and the announcement were made. He said, if you adjust the current market value for float, you get $437 billion. That would produce $72.7 billion in required trades because of the various companies that the various managers that index to the S&P 500. He says, in addition to the normal rebalancing trades of that day, which were $32 billion for September, the last time there was a rebalancing. So, it looks like you could just have an enormous, enormous amount of trading volume that day, spurred partly by Tesla and partly by other types of rebalancing. BRIAN SOZZI: Julie, my analysis this morning on Tesla is very simple, and this is the Yahoo Finance Premium stat of the day-- PE ratio trailing on Tesla, now 1,085. And all these momentum traders in Tesla buying the stock ahead of-- ahead of them joining the S&P 500, I get it. There's a lot of momentum. This is what you do. You trade that momentum, and maybe you put on more gains. But at some point, Myles and Julie, valuations on Tesla will have to matter. And it might matter now that the company is going to be part of the S&P 500, and it might matter on that fourth quarter earnings call. MYLES UDLAND: Sozzi, they have a PE. That's-- that's-- that's an improvement for Tesla, being able at least-- BRIAN SOZZI: 1,085. Sick, insane. MYLES UDLAND: You can at least-- you can at least do the math now, dividing by something like earnings. And just to-- to wrap up the point there, Tesla will be the seventh largest company in the S&P 500 upon inclusion. The market cap right now is only $20 billion less than Berkshire Hathaway's. They're currently the sixth largest company within the S&P 500. So, another decent day for Tesla, and all of a sudden it's-- it's only the FAAMG games, FAAMG including the M, with Microsoft ahead of them-- that would be Facebook, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, and of course, Apple sitting right over $2 trillion in market capital."

    "url":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/martin-tripp-settlement-with-tesla-160512420.html",
    "article_text":"Tesla sued Martin Tripp, a former Nevada Gigafactory employee, in 2018, alleging he hacked a confidential manufacturing operating system, stole more than several gigabytes of data, and leaked trade secrets to a news reporter. The company further alleged that Tripp lied to the media by asserting that punctured battery cells had been installed in certain Model 3 vehicles delivered to unsuspecting customers \u2014 a claim Tesla denies. Tesla also says Tripp exaggerated levels of scrap material used in its vehicle manufacturing process. In addition to the larger settlement, Tripp has also agreed to pay Tesla $25,000 in sanctions based on Tripp\u2019s violation of the Nevada district court\u2019s protective order requiring him to refrain from disclosing information related to confidential documents. Tripp also agreed to destroy any documents he acquired through his work at Tesla. Jacob Ma-Weaver, manager of multi-strategy fund Cable Car Capital, told Yahoo Finance he first became acquainted with Tripp after reading about the dispute in the media and seeing his GoFundMe page. \u201cI really believe firmly that all litigants deserve to compete on an equal playing field. And that's one of the unfortunate parts of our justice system \u2014 that really is not always the case. And this to me was one of those classic David versus Goliath situations,\u201d Ma-Weaver told Yahoo Finance. Ma-Weaver, a financial analyst, said his firm invests in litigation, occasionally, and generally where he has personal expertise and knowledge to bring to bear about the situation, and where there is a party who has financial constraints that prevent them from accessing the justice system. \u201c[Tripp] had the same right to defense and ability to prosecute counterclaims as anyone else,\u201d Ma-Weaver said, adding that the relationship between Tripp and Cable Car Capital ended when Tripp violated the terms of the litigation funding agreement. \u201cI think it's very clear in a situation like this where you have a giant company suing an individual for everything he\u2019s worth, and then some, even in the context of counterclaims, it can be quite difficult for them to obtain representation that\u2019s on a purely contingency basis. And where I think litigation funding can often bridge the gap is in the situations where the risk profile to the attorneys of representing an indigent individual is too high. So funding, like any provision of capital, is a way to change the balance of risk sharing, so that it's not entirely on one party or another,\u201d Ma-Weaver said. \u201cIf Tripp had had the resources himself to fund the case he never would have sought funding, full stop.\u201d In September, the court granted Tesla\u2019s motion to do away with the counterclaims asserted by Tripp, alleging that the company\u2019s CEO Elon Musk, and others at Tesla, defamed him and cast him in a false light in various emails and tweets. Yahoo Finance has requested comment from Tesla, as well as from Tripp, and will update this story with responses it receives. \u201cIn the brief period of trading that took place between the publication of each of the June 4 Article and June 6 Article and the close of the NASDAQ trading day, Tesla\u2019s market capitalization declined by $34 million and $134 million, respectively, or $167 million in total over those two short time windows,\u201d the filing said. In August 2019, Tripp\u2019s then-lawyer, Robert Mitchell, told Yahoo Finance, \u201cThese are phantom damages in our view.\u201d Tesla characterized Tripp as an underperforming former employee who became disgruntled after he was fired from the company.

    "article_text":"(Bloomberg) -- Tesla Inc. climbed on Tuesday after S&P Dow Jones Indices said it will be added to the S&P 500 Index in one shot on Dec. 21, a move that will ripple through the entire market as money managers adjust their portfolios to make room for shares of the $538 billion company. Investors in the electric vehicle maker welcomed the simpler process, sending Tesla shares up 1.7% to $577.284 at 10:42 a.m. New York time. The stock, which closed at a record high on Friday, is up about 578% this year. \u201cThis is a better outcome than what investors overall had expected,\u201d said Gary Black, a private investor who used to be the chief executive of Aegon Asset Management, noting that there was a \u201cnon-zero\u201d probability that S&P might delay one piece of the listing into next year, and that the latest announcement takes that off the table. Given Tesla\u2019s massive market size, S&P consulted with investors in November, asking for feedback on whether the stock should be folded into the index all at once or in two parts, which would have been unprecedented. The electric-vehicle maker would be the seventh-biggest company in the S&P 500 at its current market value, falling between Berkshire Hathaway Inc. and Visa Inc. With about $11 trillion in funds tied to the S&P 500, money managers have been looking toward a few busy weeks ahead no matter how Tesla was included in the index. Whether it was one fell swoop or two separate tranches, managers of index-tracking funds would still have had to offload stocks of several other companies to make room for the mammoth newcomer in their portfolios. \u201cIt looks like they\u2019re ripping the band-aid off,\u201d said Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers. \u201cIt\u2019s ultimately less disruptive than trying something new with the largest index addition ever.\u201d S&P Dow Jones Indices, announcing the plan in a brief statement Monday, said it will make public on Dec. 11 which company Tesla will replace in the index. The index provider said it will release a full statement on Tuesday morning. Adding the company in the traditional way is \u201csimple and easy to understand\u201d Black said. After the initial buying of Tesla into the Dec. 21 inclusion, the stock may pull back, if history is any guide, according to Black. The shares may fall about 10% to 20%, a pattern that would be consistent with what happened to Facebook after its entry into the S&P 500 seven years ago.

Zoom stock is in its fourth week below its 10-week moving average, after pulling back from a late-October high. Markets across Asia rebounded briskly on Tuesday. Official data in China showed factory activity expanding in November at the fastest pace since September 2017, despite lockdowns tightening in Hong Kong and Shanghai as the country faces its fourth wave of coronavirus infections. The Shanghai Composite jumped 1.8% on Tuesday. The composite rose 5.1% for November, ending just below its high for the year, set in July. In Japan, Tokyo's Nikkei 225 rebounded 1.3% on Tuesday after a dip on Monday left the index with a 15% gain in November.

For November, the CAC-40 scored a 20% advance, Frankfurt's DAX rallied 15%. Oil prices eased slightly, with West Texas Intermediate holding above $45 a barrel, after ministers of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries delayed a production decision until Thursday in order to meet with Russian counterparts. Industry watchers had anticipated a vote on Monday to trim production curbs, effectively increasing the group's output by two million barrels per day.

Eleven of the 30 Dow Jones stocks outpaced the overall index for the month. It's no surprise that Boeing was the curve bender, erupting in a 45.9% rebound that marked the stock's biggest jump since a 48% bounce in August of 1982.

    "article_text":"Matt Maley, Miller Tabak Managing Director and Equity Strategist joins Yahoo Finance Live to weigh in on what\u2019s moving markets during the pandemic. - We are still joined by Matt Maley. He is an Equity Strategist and Managing Director over at Miller Tabak. And Matt, I'd love to kind of move away from equities for just a second and talk about what I'm sure you're getting questions on, which is Bitcoin and what's happening in the crypto space. And I'm just curious what those conversations are like now for you, versus what they were in 2017, and kind of what your thoughts are on as Bitcoin as an asset and crypto as an asset class. MATT MALEY: Well, you know, it's funny, because back in 2017, I was like, this is ridiculous. It got to about this level, and I said, you ought to sell it with both hands, take profits. It worked out really well, and I just didn't believe it. I didn't understand it. There was a lot of different things. But now, especially in the last 8 to 10 months, I've changed significantly on a long term basis. I think that this is something that can go a lot higher. However, nothing moves in a straight line. And some of the people get a bit worried here. And I've been saying recently, I said, you know, it could get to 20,000, even between 20,000 and 22,000. But we're getting ripe for a 30% correction that we seem to frequently get in this. And people say, well, the euphoria is not there like it was in 2017. There's a lot of bullishness, but not quite the crazy euphoria. I was like, well, that's great. But all that really tells you is that it's probably not going to go down 80%. It doesn't mean it can't go down 20% to 30% at any given time. I mean, just look at Amazon. Amazon went down 90% after the tech bubble burst. The euphoria has never gotten back to that level. But it's had many-- I mean, it's probably had a dozen or close to a dozen declines of 30% to 40% since then. When stocks get incredibly, or any asset gets incredibly overbought, and sentiment gets incredibly bullish, it can and does see steep corrections. And so people need to be a little bit careful up at these levels. I like it better back down the $15,000 to $16,000 level right now. For those who own it, I'm not saying you should sell it, because I do like it long term. But traders should take some profits, and I think those who own it and want to buy more will get a chance to buy it at lower levels sometime in the next month or so. BRIAN SOZZI: Matt, I've read a lot of your notes this year. And you've highlighted Tesla's run through it all. What percentage, how much more upside, do you think Tesla has left, as it gets included into the S&P 500? 10%? 20%? Can it double? What are you thinking? Because we're really seeing a melt up here in the stock. MATT MALEY: Yeah, I mean, it's funny. Pre-split I was saying with the stock at below 200, I was like, pound the table, you've got to own this thing. Now all-time highs. You know, fundamentally, it's just not there. I mean, I guess my point is, there's opportunities out there in the marketplace where you can make with a lot less risk. Maybe you won't be able to make as much money as you will in Tesla from these levels. Again, I'm not talking about if you bought it when the stock was at $200 or $50 or whatever. Of course, it's been an unbelievable stock. And the company, it's the same situation. There are not the same risks we had two years ago in this company. That doesn't mean there aren't any risks. And that doesn't mean that there aren't-- this stock is going to see some significant declines over time. Again, if you're a long term believer, you want to hold it, that's great. But I think for those who want to add to it, same thing. It's just got the valuations have become out of control. And it's one thing to-- these stay-at-home stocks, people were paying high valuations for some of those names, nothing like they are right now for Tesla. Tesla is not going to change the world to that degree, in my opinion. But maybe I'm wrong. We'll see. - All right, Matt Maley with Miller Tabak. Matt, great to have you on the show, always fun to get your thoughts. I know we'll talk soon. MATT MALEY: Thank you very much. Have a great one."

    "article_text":"By Edward Taylor, Jan Schwartz and J\u00f6rn Poltz FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Alexander Hitzinger, a 49-year-old engineer who defected to Apple after helping to develop Porsche's winning 919 racecar, has been lured back to Volkswagen Group for perhaps his biggest challenge yet - building an electric car to take on Tesla. While Volkswagen, the world's largest automaker, has been rolling out electric vehicles from the ID.3 compact to the high end Porsche Taycan, analysts say it needs a more comprehensive system that integrates electric power with new self-driving and infotainment technologies if it hopes to overtake Tesla. It has turned to Hitzinger, whose ability to conceptualise clean-sheet designs and manage projects helped Porsche develop a racecar that won the Le Mans endurance race in 2015, 2016, 2017. After a stint working on Apple's autonomous cars, Hitzinger now heads up Volkswagen's \"Project Artemis\", named after the Ancient Greek goddess of hunting, with the aim of chasing down electric car pioneer Tesla. \"At Porsche, I always thought of a vehicle as a comprehensive system. This is a very important point. It is what Tesla does well,\" he explained in a video interview. The task of building a car has gotten more complex with the advent of electric and autonomous driving technologies, forcing new battery-driven powertrains to compete for electricity with camera, radar, and lidar sensors, plus infotainment systems. Rather than stitching together separately designed systems, Artemis wants to create something new and seamlessly integrated, from the ground up, Hitzinger told Reuters. \"The idea behind Artemis is to have a comprehensive understanding of the vehicle. When something is optimised, this has knock-on effects and these need to be understood.\" Allocating processing power between propulsion, automated driving and infotainment systems such as satellite navigation and music streaming is a key challenge, he said. But it's not the only one. \"The human-machine interface, the interior design, the exterior design, aerodynamics and the range are all interconnected. If I modify something on the exterior, it will impact the aerodynamics and the efficiency,\" Hitzinger said. Volkswagen Group, whose brands range from budget Seats and Skodas to high-end Audis and Bentleys is now focussing on developing systems that can handle all these new demands. The car, which is due to be produced in 2024, will make use of components developed for Porsche and Audi's premium electric vehicle platform, PPE. The group's factory in Hanover, Germany, is being retooled to build an electric sport-utility vehicle for Audi, Bentley and Porsche. Having a small team of highly qualified engineers, who are empowered to take decisions unencumbered by the corporate bureaucracy of the Volkswagen empire, should end up producing a better vehicle more quickly. Project Artemis will have between 200 and 250 staff once Hitzinger is done hiring, up from 10 at present. \"I am putting the team together on a top down basis. The managers come first. Then I look for A-players, who will attract other A-players. I don't want managers, but people who love to develop technologies, who are prepared to take risks,\" he said. Artemis will seek to draw on existing skills within the Volkswagen Group, such as expertise in making vehicle bodies at Audi, but take the lead in developing new techniques which speed up production and improve the customer experience. \"We want to set new standards for what a customer can do in a vehicle and how he interacts with the car,\" Hitzinger said. He declined to elaborate on what user experiences the new car would offer, citing the confidential nature of the project. He also declined to comment on a power struggle unfolding at Volkswagen, which has convened its executive committee to meet on Tuesday to decide whether to extend CEO Herbert Diess's contract.

    "article_text":"On the downside, Zoom Video, the ultimate coronavirus play, reported better-than-expected results and upside guidance. But Zoom Video stock fell solidly before the open Tesla and Zoom Video stock are two of the biggest 2020 winners, up 578% and 603%, respectively as of Monday's close. But MRNA stock is 681% year to to date. Nio stock is up a 1,157% so far in 2020. Recent IPO Xpeng stock is up just 291%, though it tripled in November alone. Apple stock, the ultimate megacap, rose before the open after closing right at an aggressive entry. Dow Jones futures rose 1.05% vs. fair value. S&P 500 futures climbed 1%. Nasdaq 100 futures advanced 1%. Apple stock gave a lift to the Dow Jones, S&P 500 and Nasdaq. There are renewed efforts to push for a fresh stimulus deal, at least on unemployment benefits. It's unclear if House Democrats and Senate Republicans will budget on their demands. Caixin's China manufacturing index rose 1.3 points in November to 54.9, the highest in 10 years. That comes a day after the official China manufacturing gauge hit a three-year high. Coronavirus cases worldwide reached 63.70 million. Covid-19 deaths topped 1.47 million. Coronavirus cases in the U.S. have hit 13.92 million, with deaths above 274,000. Moderna stock spiked 20% Monday, capping a 126% explosion in November. MRNA stock kept soaring, tacking on 10% early Tuesday. The stock market rally had a down day, but the Nasdaq was resilient while leading stocks did well overall. For the month, the Dow Jones soared 11.9%, the S&P 500 10.8% and the Nasdaq 11.8%. Some highflying IPOs came under pressure Monday, though they generally closed with modest losses or even reversed higher. Zoom Video earnings shot up 1,000% to 99 cents a share, with revenue up 366.5% to $777.19 million. Analysts expected Zoom Video earnings of 76 cents on revenue of $693.4 million. The videoconferencing leader guided higher for Q4 and for 2021. However, Zoom Video stock fell 7% in premarket action. Shares rose 1.4% to 478.36 on Monday, reclaiming the 50-day line. Giving a boost to Qualcomm and Qorvo stock, Apple stock rose 2.1% to 119.05, though it backed off an intraday high of 120.97. Loop Capital upgraded Apple to a buy with a 131 price target, expecting upside to iPhone sales and other products and services. Morgan Stanley tapped the iPhone maker as a strong 5G play. An aggressive investor could start an AAPL stock position here, then perhaps add more shares as it clears the 122.09 and 125.49 levels and finally the 138.08 buy point. Apple stock has slightly lagged the broader market for the past few months. If the tech giant can wake up, it would add real momentum to the major indexes. Apple stock rose 2% before the open. Tesla stock rose nearly 5% early Tuesday on the S&P Dow Jones Indices' decision to add the EV maker to the S&P 500 index in one go. Because of Tesla's huge market cap, the committee had mulled splitting the stock's entry into two tranches. Tesla stock has skyrocketed since the announcement that Tesla will join the S&P 500 before the open on Dec. 21. Meanwhile, Tesla got China's official green light on Monday to sell the Model Y from its Shanghai plant, as expected. Tesla stock briefly rose to a new high of 607.80 soon after Monday's open before reversing for a 3.1% decline to 567.30. Nio delivered 5,291 electric vehicles in November, up 109% vs. a year earlier. That includes 2,386 ES6s, 1,387 ES8s and 1,518 EC6s. The recently launched EC6 crossover will compete with the Tesla Model Y when that launches. Xpeng delivered 4,224 electric vehicles, up 342% vs. a year earlier. That includes 2,732 P7 sedans, which competes with the Tesla Model 3. Xpeng also sold 1,492 G3s, its small SUV. Li Auto will likely release November delivery figures in the next few days. Goldman Sachs raised its price targets on Nio and Li Auto stock for good measure. Overall China EV production and sales, including Tesla figures will probably come next week. Nio stock rose 2% early Tuesday. Xpeng rallied 5% and Li Auto stock 8%. On Monday, Nio sank 6.4% while Li Auto and Xpeng stock lost nearly 9% on a bad day for U.S.-listed Chinese stocks. Kandi Technologies tumbled 28% after short-seller Hindenburg Research accused the Chinese EV maker of fraudulent sales. YOU MAY ALSO LIKE:"

    "article_text":"The selling seen off the open yesterday didn\u2019t last long as S&P futures started grinding higher after the close. From there, buying hasn\u2019t stopped and stocks look to open the month right at all-time highs. The momentum higher looks to take us above the all-time high print of 3668 in the S&P futures. This was the spike seen after the vaccine news early in November. The question for the bulls is if there is \u201cfresh powder\u201d all the way to 3700, or will profit takers step in. Potential news might have some influence as ISM manufacturing will come in later this morning. Additionally, Fed Chair Powell and Treasury Secretary Mnuchin will be in front of congress today in a hearing on COVID-19. Investors should watch for comments on the need for stimulus, as both men can influence some movement on a COVID relief package. S&P Futures Trading Levels The S&P futures currently sit at 3360, just eight handles below the all-time high print. Support levels for the day will be 3650 and 3626. Upside resistance is 3685 and 3706. The current S&P trading environment is breaking out higher. The 21-day MA for the S&P 500 is at 3535 and the 50-day is 3450. While we are extended far beyond the MA\u2019s, Fibonacci targets above will likely draw the market into the 3730-50 range. Three Stocks to Watch  TSLA- Tesla sold off yesterday as there were worries that the S&P addition would be done in two tranches. However, an announcement last night confirmed the liquidity would be acceptable and it can all be done on December 21st. Tesla will be the seventh biggest S&P company after the additon, so traders are trying to get ahead of all that buying that has to happen. The stock is up almost 5% premarket. ZM- Zoom Video reported a big beat of $0.99 v the $0.75 expected. The company guided Q4 higher and raise FY21. It was no surprise that the company would perform this quarter, but there are worries in what kind of growth the company will see when economies open up. The stock is trading down over 6% premarket. GBTC\/Bitcoin\u2013 Bitcoin is trying to break all time highs and is trading just under $20,000 in the futures contract. It has been quite the run for bitcoin, which is up over 100% since September. The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) is one way to get exposure without having to directly buy bitcoin. Investors in GBTC have been rewarded this year, seeing gains of about 130%. Biggest Tech Breakthrough in a GenerationBe among the early investors in the new type of device that experts say could impact society as much as the discovery of electricity. Current technology will soon be outdated and replaced by these new devices. In the process, it\u2019s expected to create 22 million jobs and generate $12.3 trillion in activity.A select few stocks could skyrocket the most as rollout accelerates for this new tech.

    "article_text":"Tesla Inc. TSLA recently procured an official permission to start selling its Shanghai-made Model Y series of sports utility vehicle (SUV) in China.Tesla\u2019s flagship model in China \u2014 Model Y \u2014 has been recently registered officially with the nation\u2019s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT). Chinese regulators at the MIIT published the sales approval on its website this Monday.The Model Y is an all-electric, mid-sized SUV, with seating capacity up to seven, equipped with cylindrical nickel, cobalt and manganese (NCM) batteries. It is the second model Tesla will manufacture at its Giga Factory in Shanghai, China, following the Model 3 sedan. Earlier this month, the company started boosting the production capacity of its Shanghai Giga factory so it could commence producing the Model Y vehicles there. The Shanghai factory is slated to roll out its first Model Y cars in early 2021.Tesla currently sells its Model 3 electric vehicles (EV) in China. The Shanghai Giga factory began production last October and sold its first made-in-China Tesla cars, the Model 3 series, to Chinese customers in December the same year. The company, in fact, delivered more than 12,000 Model 3 vehicles in the country in October this year. The EV giant has also started exporting China-made Model 3 cars to Europe as well as plans to develop electric vehicle chargers in China in 2021.Tesla\u2019s Giga Factory was waiting for a production permit to mass produce the Model Y. Now that the red-hot EV maker has obtained the sales permit from MIIT, it can commence mass production of Model Y. Tesla China\u2019s goal is to manufacture 550,000 units in 2021, out of which 250,000 Model Y vehicles need to be produced next year. Given that 2021 will be the first year Giga Shanghai attempts to produce the Model Y, building 250,000 units of Model Y SUV would be quite a challenge for the company.\u00a0Moreover, if the Shanghai Giga Factory is able to meet its target, Tesla \u2014 currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) \u2014 could produce 1 million cars in a year in 2021, achieving another milestone. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. Currently, China is the world\u2019s biggest EV market and the country has been head strong in its transition toward a green future.\u00a0 Importantly, the country aims electric cars to account for 25% of the new car sales by 2025 and kick start an era of green transportation. Amid this transforming scenario, automakers in China are fast changing gears to electric. Despite the coronavirus pandemic rattling the auto sector, China's EV space has been witnessing a boom as one after another carmakers have reported new highs in monthly and quarterly deliveries.Reportedly, Tesla\u2019s share of China\u2019s EV market was 21% during the first six months of 2020 compared with the prior year\u2019s 6%. Tesla regained its Chinese market share once it started selling domestically-produced vehicles in China in late 2019 as those were 13% cheaper for Chinese consumers than the vehicles imported from the United States. In the first nine months of 2020, China accounted for 19% of Tesla\u2019s top line compared with the 12% reported in the corresponding period of 2019.\u00a0Even with its dominant market share in the mainland, the California-based automaker faces stiff competition from Chinese electric vehicle firms like the Shanghai-based electric startup NIO Inc. NIO.Further, Chinese companies like XPeng Inc. XPEV and Li Auto LI, both of which debuted on U.S. exchanges recently, are also capitalizing on this trending EV hype.\u00a0 Imagine getting in early on a young industry primed to skyrocket from $17.7 billion in 2019 to an expected $73.6 billion by 2027.Although marijuana stocks did better as the pandemic took hold than the market as a whole, they\u2019ve been pushed down.

Ives reiterated his Underperform rating and $15 price target on Nikola\u2019s stock. Investor attention now turns to new Nikola CEO and veteran manufacturing executive Mark Russell, who will have to likely move faster than he would have liked to raise fresh capital. While Nikola ended the third quarter with $907 million in cash, it could be burned through quickly given the company\u2019s losses ($235 million operating loss through the third quarter) and infrastructure build out plans. In August, Nikola broke ground on a 1 million-square-foot, $600 million manufacturing plant in Arizona. The plant is the linchpin in Nikola beginning to address a backlog of semi-truck orders reportedly north of 14,000. Finishing the plant and building giant electric trucks from it will require a great deal of cash. Further capital will likely be needed to support the rollout of semi-truck charging stations because as of now, Nikola hasn\u2019t secured a partner for them. \u201cWe believe a capital raise is in the cards as with GM scaling down its partnership we see Nikola needing to tap the capital markets to strengthen its cash position. The company has major ambitions which require significant resources and partnerships over the coming years to accomplish its hydrogen fuel cell goals,\u201d Ives told Yahoo Finance via email. Given Nikola has never produced a truck, has never turned a profit and has endured a trying few months of headlines (from the exit of founder Trevor Milton to an SEC inquiry) any capital injection could be on very unfriendly terms for shareholders.

Earlier this week Diess had demanded a vote of confidence in his reform efforts by asking for an early contract extension even though key stakeholders at the company opposed the move, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters. Volkswagen declined to comment. \"The executive committee will not be pressured into a decision, there is no rush,\" one of the people familiar with the matter said, commenting on the potential contract extension. The executive committee, headed by Volkswagen's chairman Hans Dieter Poetsch, includes Wolfgang Porsche and Hans Michel Piech, members of the carmaker's owning families who control a majority voting stake, as well as VW labour boss Bernd Osterloh. Ahead of the meeting on Tuesday, Diess outlined his vision for reforming the carmaker, saying he had not succeeded in overhauling its German operations where VW's labour chiefs can block significant decisions. \"The families continue to support Diess,\" a spokesman for Porsche Automobil Holding SE, the company which holds a majority voting stake in Volkswagen said ahead of the meeting on Tuesday. Diess, who defected from BMW in 2015, and helped Volkswagen reform after its diesel scandal with a 73 billion euro ($87 billion) electric vehicle investment plan, has grown frustrated with opposition to cost cuts. Analysts said the potential crisis at Volkswagen highlighted the difficulties of reforming a carmaker where labour representatives control half the seats on the board of directors and local politicians have a 20% voting stake, allowing them to vote down strategic proposals. \"The company has some of the most amazing and most global brands, it has the scale to deploy any technology and the innovation power to be an early mover. What it appears to be lacking is the right corporate governance,\" Bernstein autos analyst Arndt Ellinghorst said in a note late on Monday. \"There should be no illusion, this transformation will always trigger conflicts. Whether there is a new CEO or not, the questions will remain the same, and any VW CEO will need the full backing from VW's largest shareholders, the Porsche families.\" Volkswagen is worth 77.2 billion euros ($92.4 billion), far below rival Toyota Motor Corp's market value of $155.7 billion and Tesla Inc's $555 billion. That is despite the fact that Volkswagen sold 10.96 million vehicles last year - the most by any carmaker around the globe - while Toyota came in second with 10.74 million. Tesla sold only 367,500 cars in the same period. Volkswagen Group had 671,205 employees at the end of 2019, compared with 359,542 at Toyota at the end of its fiscal year, and 48,016 at Tesla last year. FORCING THE ISSUE German companies customarily deliberate contract extensions for management board members only a year ahead of expiration. Diess, however, forced the issue after Osterloh stifled his reform efforts. They included Diess' attempts to install allies Arno Antlitz as chief financial officer and Thomas Schmall as chief procurement officer on the management board, the three sources told Reuters. Rather than approving each individual appointment, the labour leaders insist on approving a \"package solution\" which is \"harmonious\", two people familiar with the deliberations said. Osterloh is also said to oppose an early contract extension for Diess, one of the three sources said. In a post on LinkedIn this week, Osterloh said there was no fight about management appointments because no committee on the supervisory board had been formally consulted about the issue. Diess, for his part, voiced his frustration in his own a post on Linkedin. \"When I started in Wolfsburg, I was determined to change the \u2018Volkswagen system\u2019. What I mean by that is to break down antiquated structures, and make the company more agile and modern,\" Diess said. \"With the support of many equally motivated people around me, I succeeded in doing so in several areas, but not in others; foremost amongst them at our corporate headquarters in Wolfsburg.\" (Reporting by Edward Taylor and Jan Schwartz; Editing by Pravin Char, Mark Potter and Tom Brown)"

    "article_text":"FRANKFURT, Dec 1 (Reuters) - Volkswagen, the world's largest vehicle maker by sales, risked a leadership crisis on Tuesday after Chief Executive Herbert Diess forced a vote of confidence in his reform efforts by asking for an early contract extension. The multi-brand car and truck maker is convening its Executive Committee to discuss Diess's demand for the contract extension, more than a year before his current term comes to an end in 2023, three sources told Reuters on Monday. The Austrian manager, who defected from BMW in 2015, and helped VW to reform after its diesel scandal with a 73 billion euro ($87 billion) electric vehicle investment plan, has grown frustrated with German labour leaders blocking cost cuts. The supervisory board's Executive Committee, which is headed by VW Chairman Hans Dieter Poetsch, and includes Wolfgang Porsche and Hans Michel Piech, members of the carmaker's owning families, as well as labour boss Bernd Osterloh, is due to meet on Tuesday, the three sources told Reuters. Volkswagen declined to comment. The meeting comes on the same day that Tesla's CEO Elon Musk is due to receive the Axel Springer award for his achievements in the area of engineering in Berlin, after the electric carmaker decided to build a factory on the outskirts of the German capital. Analysts said the Volkswagen committee meeting highlighted the difficulties in reforming a carmaker where labour representatives control half the seats on the board of directors and local politicians have a 20% voting stake, allowing them to vote down significant strategic reform proposals. \"The company has some of the most amazing and most global brands, it has the scale to deploy any technology and the innovation power to be an early mover.

    "article_text":"What Happened: The South Korean battery maker reportedly plans the move to keep up with Tesla\u2019s growth in China, which is the world\u2019s largest car market. LG Chem will supply battery cells from its Chinese and Korean factories to Tesla\u2019s manufacturing sites in the United States and Germany, two people with the knowledge of the matter told Reuters. \u201cTesla simply doesn\u2019t have enough battery cells,\u201d revealed an unnamed person \u2014 adding, \u201cSo LG Chem is going to more than double China output.\u201d LG Chem added production lines to its South Korean factories this year to meet the demand arising from Tesla\u2019s U.S. plants, according to unnamed sources of the newswire. \u201cWe\u2019re continuing to expand capacity for cylindrical battery cells in response to growing demand from automakers but we can\u2019t comment on specific customers,\u201d an LG Chem spokesperson said. Why It Matters: LG Chem\u2019s battery cell business became an independent unit on Tuesday. The company plans to triple the capacity of cylindrical cells to 60-gigawatt hours by 2023, as per Reuters. Strong demand for Tesla\u2019s vehicles is reportedly a positive development for LG Chem, Panasonic, and China\u2019s Contemporary Amperex Technology Co Ltd. LG Chem will invest $500 million over 2020 to raise the production capacity of 21700 cylindrical battery cells used by Tesla by 8 GWh at its Nanjing plant, according to the local government. Reuters sources revealed that LG Chem\u2019s plan involves raising the number of production lines from eight to 17. LG Chem and CATL supply battery cells for Model 3 vehicles, while the Korean manufacturer is the sole supplier for the Shanghai-built Model Y SUVs. Calculations made by Reuters indicate 17 lines at Nanjing would be able to supply 323,000 vehicles a year as each LG Chem line is able to make 7 million cells a month and each model uses 4,416 battery cells.

    "url":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/exclusive-lg-chem-double-china-052725905.html",
    "article_text":"SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's LG Chem Ltd plans to more than double production capacity of battery cells it makes in China for Tesla Inc electric vehicles (EV) next year, sources said, to keep up with its U.S. client's growth in the biggest car market. The firm, a supplier for Tesla's Shanghai-built Model 3, will also ship its increased output from China as well as Korea to Tesla's factories in Germany and the United States, said two people with knowledge of the matter, signalling an increased role in the supply chain of the world's leading EV manufacturer. The plan comes as Tesla, LG Chem's primary customer, scrambles to secure cells as part of an aggressive global production expansion plan, as it targets soaring demand fanned by governments promoting EVs to curb air pollution. LG Chem has already added production lines in South Korea this year mainly to meet demand from Tesla's U.S. plant, the people said. Moreover, the automaker has asked Japan's Panasonic Corp - which supplies the U.S. plant - to also supply its Shanghai factory, said one of the people, who declined to be identified as the matter was confidential. \"Tesla simply doesn't have enough battery cells,\" said the person. \"So LG Chem is going to more than double China output.\" Tesla's growth represents a boon for LG Chem, Panasonic and Chinese supplier Contemporary Amperex Technology Co Ltd (CATL), with Chief Executive Elon Musk revealing plans in September to increase purchases. Still, Musk said supplies were insufficient and announced Tesla's plans to make its own, cheaper battery cells - a prospect that could injure suppliers' pricing power. \"We're continuing to expand capacity for cylindrical battery cells in response to growing demand from automakers but we can't comment on specific customers,\" an LG Chem spokesman said. LG Chem, whose battery cell business on Tuesday became an independent unit, in October said it would triple capacity of cylindrical cells to 60 gigawatt hours by 2023, without naming Tesla or disclosing other details. Its China plan and Germany and U.S. destinations are reported here for the first time. Tesla was not immediately available for comment. Panasonic declined to comment. MODEL Y LG Chem will invest $500 million over the next year to raise annual production capacity of 21700 cylindrical battery cells - a type used by Tesla - at its Nanjing plant by 8 GWh, the local government said last week, without disclosing current capacity. The two people told Reuters the plan involved increasing the number of production lines to at least 17 from eight. LG Chem, alongside CATL, supplies battery cells for Tesla's Model 3 sedan built in Shanghai, where production began last year and whose current annual capacity is 250,000 cars. Tesla aims to start making its Model Y sport-utility vehicle at the plant next year, for which capacity will reach 250,000 by 2022, Morningstar previously reported. Each model uses 4,416 battery cells, and each LG Chem line is able to produce up to 7 million cells a month, one of the people said. LG Chem's 17 lines in Nanjing would therefore be able to cater for up to 323,000 vehicles a year, a Reuters calculation showed. Initially, LG Chem will be the sole supplier for Shanghai-built Model Y cars, said one of the people. CATL was not immediately available for comment. LG Chem's China factory will also initially supply battery cells for Tesla vehicles in Berlin when production there begins, the person said. The automaker needs permission should it want to make its own cells locally.

    "article_text":"By Arunima Kumar and Noel Randewich (Reuters) - Tesla Inc shares jumped 4% in extended trade on Monday after S&P Dow Jones Indices said it would add one of Wall Street's most valuable companies to the S&P 500 index all at once on Dec. 21. Adding Elon Musk's Tesla to Wall Street's most followed benchmark will force index funds to buy about $73 billion worth of its shares, S&P Dow Jones Indices said. The electric car maker's stock has surged over 40% since Nov. 16, when it was announced Tesla would join the index. At that time, S&P Dow Jones Indices said it would consult investors about whether to potentially add Tesla in two tranches a week apart to make the addition easier to handle for index funds. \"In its decision, S&P DJI considered the wide range of responses it received, as well as, among other factors, the expected liquidity of Tesla and the market\u2019s ability to accommodate significant trading volumes on this date,\" S&P Dow Jones Indices said in a media statement. With a stock market value around $550 billion, Tesla will be among the most valuable companies ever added to the index. Tesla will account for just over 1% of the S&P 500. Up about 600% in 2020, the California-based car maker has become the most valuable auto company in the world, by far, despite production that is a fraction of rivals such as Toyota Motor, Volkswagen and General Motors. A blockbuster quarterly report in July cleared a major hurdle related to profitability that had prevented Tesla's inclusion in the S&P 500. About a fifth of Tesla's shares are closely held by Musk, the chief executive, and other insiders. Since the S&P 500 is weighted by the amount of companies' shares actually available on the stock market, Tesla's influence within the benchmark will be slightly diminished, putting it at around seventh place, currently held by Johnson & Johnson. S&P Dow Jones said it would announce on Dec. 11 which company Tesla would replace in the S&P 500.

    "article_text":"In September, the automakers reach a $2 billion agreement that gave GM an 11% stake in Nikola for supplying battery and fuel cell technologies as well as producing the Badger. But now, GM\u00a0is giving up its equity stake in Nikola, which will also refund order deposits for the Badger. Under the new pact, Nikola and GM will \"work together to integrate GM's Hydrotec fuel-cell technology into Nikola's Class 7 and Class 8 zero-emission semi-trucks for the medium- and long-haul trucking sectors,' the company said in a statement. Nikola expects to begin testing the trucks by the end of 2021-22. In addition, Nikola is in discussions with GM to use GM's Ultium battery system in Nikola's trucks. \"In a nutshell, the signing of GM as a partner is a positive, but ultimately no ownership\/equity stake in Nikola and the billions of R&D potentially now off the table is a major negative blow to the Nikola story,\" wrote Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives in a note Monday. \"This went from a game-changer deal for Nikola to a good supply partnership but nothing to write home about.\" The GM-Nikola deal for a Badger manufacturing partnership initially was expected to close before Sept. 30. But the talks hit a snag with the deadline pushed to this week, after fraud allegations against Nikola and its founder, Trevor Milton. A report from short-seller Hindenburg Research said Milton had misled investors and over-exaggerated the capabilities of the startup's drivetrain and other technologies. Nikola denied the allegations. But Milton resigned as the company's executive chairman on Sept. 21. In addition to the fraud claims, two women have filed sexual assault claims with Utah authorities against Milton. GM now plans to spend $27 billion on electric cars and autonomous vehicles through 2025, up from a prior target of $20 billion. Also by 2025, GM plans to launch 30 electric cars around the world, with two-thirds of them available in the U.S. Previously, it planned at least 20 new models by 2023. The company sped up the development schedules for 12 vehicle programs: the Hummer electric truck, three other GMC Ultium variants that include an EV pickup, four Chevrolet electric vehicles that also includes a pickup and compact crossover, and four Cadillacs. The Lyriq, Cadillac's first all-electric vehicle, which will arrive in Q1 2022, is nine months ahead of its prior schedule. YOU MAY ALSO LIKE:"

    "url":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/tesla-starts-week-3-gain-133430390.html",
    "article_text":"(Bloomberg) -- Tesla Inc. shares were volatile on Monday ahead of a decision by S&P Dow Jones Indices on how it plans to add the electric vehicle company to its benchmark. Tesla\u2019s $554 billion market cap poses a challenge for addition into the index, prompting the S&P to request feedback from the financial community on whether to include the stock all at once on Dec. 21 or break it in over two days -- which would be a first in S&P history. An S&P spokesperson said the decision will be announced at 5:15pm New York time on Monday. The company\u2019s impending entry to the group of 500 companies has led to a buying frenzy in its stock and on those of other upstart electric vehicle makers, leading to a more than 40% jump in the company\u2019s share price just since Nov. 16 when the decision was announced. Tesla shares rose as much as 3.81% to touch a record high of $607.80, and then dropped 5.3%. Currently they are trading down 0.5%. Whichever way it is added, Tesla\u2019s inclusion in the prestigious index will be a big event for money managers. Its current size - Tesla would fit between Berkshire Hathaway Inc. and Facebook Inc., the fifth and sixth biggest index members - means managers of index-tracking funds will have to sell stocks of several other companies to make room for the newcomer in their portfolio, leading to a lot of shuffling. Earlier this month, analysts at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said the move could result in $8 billion of demand from active U.S. large-cap mutual funds. That would represent about 1.5% of Tesla\u2019s current market value. \u201cThe most likely scenario remains two inclusion tranches of 50% each, on Dec. 14 and Dec. 21,\u201d said Gary Black, who was chief executive of Aegon Asset Management from mid 2016 through September, and now holds Tesla as a private investor. Black expects the stock to run up ahead of the first inclusion, and then retreat about 10% to 20%, a pattern he said would be consistent with what happened with Facebook Inc.\u2019s shares after its entry into the S&P 500 Index in Dec. 2013. \u201cBig question is how many shares of Tesla will actually be needed by money managers,\u201d Black said. The investor estimates managers overseeing index-tracking funds of about $5 trillion will require 120 million shares to match up the company\u2019s expected 1.4% index weighting. Tesla currently has about 948 million shares outstanding and a free float of about 758 million. Black is bullish on Tesla and has a $720 price target on the stock over six to 12 months. That would represent a 23% rise from Friday\u2019s close. Tesla on Monday also won Chinese approval to start selling its Shanghai-assembled Model Y SUVs in the country, a development that can further add to the already-high investor optimism. Meanwhile, electric vehicle startup Nikola Corp. suffered a setback on Monday, as General Motors Co. scaled back a partnership with the company, scrapping a tentative deal to jointly build an electric pickup truck and replaced it with a non-binding deal to supply hydrogen-fuel technology.

    "article_text":"Chicago, IL \u2013 November 30, 2020 \u2013 Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include Tesla TSLA, NVIDIA NVDA, Cadence Design Systems CDNS, Flex FLEX and Keysight Technologies KEYS. The resurgence in coronavirus cases is drawing attention to the importance of electric vehicles (EV), and prompting us to reconsider the future of transport by focusing on fully autonomous vehicles and how the same can address safety issues triggered by the crisis. The coronavirus situation is now anticipated to accelerate the adoption of driverless vehicles to carry passengers, transport goods and others. Moreover, demand for fuel efficient and smarter high-performance vehicles compliant with government imposed stringent emission rules necessitate a future of driving dominated by green vehicles. Markedly, improvement in the EV infrastructure, which combines innovation in semiconductors, simulation software, electronics testing equipment and measuring instruments, predictive algorithms, and AI, is enabling automakers to bring EVs mainstream sooner than anticipated. The rapid developments can primarily be attributed to breakthroughs in technology with the integration of robust AI and ML capabilities in the advanced driver-assistance system (ADAS). The automotive industry bigwigs are making every effort to enhance the safety of passengers and drivers in EVs and self-driving cars, and foot-travelers in transit. Thereby, advanced testing methodologies are in huge demand as automakers and tech companies seek to deliver advanced automotive systems. Ongoing momentum of mobility-as-a-service (MaaS) solutions and the accelerated deployment of 5G are anticipated to be tailwinds. Despite the coronavirus pandemic-led crisis, the optimism in this space is evident from the notable performance of Global X Autonomous & Electric Vehicles ETF (DRIV), which has rallied 48.8% year to date compared with the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust SPY\u2019s growth of 12.7%. Moreover, recent growing market interest in EVs is noteworthy with Tesla up 586% on a year-to-date basis. Per Allied Market Research data, the global EV market is projected to hit $802.81 billion by 2027, from $162.34 billion in 2019, at a CAGR of 22.6%. This brings our focus to four technology stocks that are well positioned to gain from the current scenario: NVIDIA\u00a0is partnering with automotive companies to drive innovation in simulation software, automotive sensors, cameras and LiDars to facilitate driverless transport. The company is working with more than 320 automakers, tier-one suppliers, automotive research institutions, HD mapping companies and start-ups to develop and deploy AI systems for self-driving vehicles. The Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company\u2019s launch of Drive AGX Orin deserves a special mention. It is a highly advanced software-defined platform for autonomous vehicles and robots powered by a new system-on-a-chip (SoC) called Orin that consists of 17 billion transistors. It was recently selected by Li Auto, in a bid to accelerate the development of its next generation of EVs. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. The company expects its automotive TAM to be $30 billion by 2025, which comprises $25 billion for driving, $3 billion for training\/development of deep neural networks and $2 billion for validation and testing. Higher sales of AI (artificial intelligence) cockpit solutions and traction witnessed by automotive platforms for infotainment systems position the company well to capitalize on the EV boom. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2021 earnings has been revised upward by 5.8% in the past 30 days to $9.66 per share. Cadence Design Systems\u00a0continues to invest heavily in verification and digital design products, which is helping it to launch products that address the ever-growing needs of semiconductor companies involved in making chips for ADAS. Further, Cadence\u2019s Advanced Packaging solutions continue to witness incremental adoption in hyperscale and automotive verticals. Markedly, the company\u2019s Allegro technology was implemented by a well-known auto maker for wafer level system packaging requirements in third-quarter 2020. Cadence has recently introduced System-Level Verification IP (System VIP) solution. The latest set of offerings provide improved chip-level verification efficiency for customers who are engaged in production of automotive, hyperscale, mobile and consumer chips. This Zacks Rank #2 company has also won orders from well-known companies like Intel\u2019s MobilEye and Infineon, which are developing ADAS related technologies. The consensus mark for 2020 earnings has been revised upward by 5.9% in the past 60 days to $2.70 per share. Investors, looking to invest in mid-cap stocks, can count on Flex, which is gaining from recovery in the automotive sector. The company is expanding its business in the automotive sector especially in the field of autonomous cars and electrification. This Zacks Rank #2 player has also inked an alliance with Leddar Tech to work on LiDAR sensors. Markedly, Leddar Tech is well-known sensing solutions\u2019 developer for ADAS and autonomous vehicles. For third-quarter fiscal 2021, Flex Reliability Solutions\u2019 is projected to report revenue growth of low to mid-single digits, sequentially, based on a recovering automotive sector and continued strength in the industrial end-market such as power products. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2021 earnings has been revised upward by 11.5% in the past 30 days to $1.26 per share. Keysight Technologies\u00a0is gaining from increasing investment in advanced automotive technology, which led to double-digit growth in orders in fourth-quarter fiscal 2020 in a sequential basis across all regions. The company is witnessing uptick in ScienLab EV test solutions in Asia and Europe on government mandate-led electrification of vehicles. In a bid to capitalize on growing investments, the company rolled out a new radar target simulator for ADAS, and another solution for testing Automotive Ethernet standards compliance for in-vehicle networks. The company has also announced collaborations with SGS and Qualcomm to advance testing of Cellular Vehicle-to-Everything, or C-V2X, technology. Additionally, improving supply chain management and uptick in 5G chip design solutions on accelerated 5G deployment boosts the company\u2019s business prospects. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2021 earnings has been revised upward by 3.9% in the past 30 days to $5.56 per share. Keysight currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana. Ignited by referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $17.7 billion in 2019 to a staggering $73.6 billion by 2027.

    "article_text":"The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down more than 300 points midday Monday, after closing above the 30,000 level for the first time ever last week. Yet the three major indexes are poised to wrap up November with big gains north of 10% each. It's been a volatile few months. On Sept. 30, the IBD stock market outlook was upgraded to \"confirmed uptrend\" from \"market in correction.\" But on Oct. 23, the outlook was downgraded to \"uptrend under pressure\" as stocks sold off. On Nov. 4, after Election Day, the\u00a0market outlook\u00a0returned to \"confirmed uptrend\" as the\u00a0major indexes staged big rallies. That gives the green light to buy leading stocks that are\u00a0breaking out of solid bases. Automakers, energy and retail stocks led the downside among IBD's 197 industry groups. Database software and dairy products makers were some of the few advancing groups. In September, the automakers struck a $2 billion deal that gave GM an 11% stake in Nikola for supplying battery and fuel cell technologies as well as producing the Badger. But now, GM\u00a0is giving up its equity stake in Nikola, which will also refund order deposits for the Badger. YOU MAY ALSO LIKE:"

    "url":"https:\/\/www.investors.com\/research\/options\/tesla-stock-how-to-trade-a-broken-wing-butterfly\/?src=A00220",
    "article_text":"Tesla stock has been on fire lately, rallying from 400 to 585 since being added to the S&P 500. While it would take a brave person to bet against Tesla stock, today I want to look at an option trade idea that will profit if Tesla consolidates around this level. The trade can also make money if Tesla stock rallies a little bit, but not too much. A broken wing butterfly using calls is a trade that can be set up with zero risk on the downside and a nice profit zone on the upside. The catch is that there is risk on upside if Tesla stock makes a big move higher. So, this is a neutral to slightly bullish trade. Very bullish traders would not enter this trade. Let's take a look at how a broken wing butterfly trade might be set up on Tesla stock: Notice that the lower strike call is 20 points away from the middle call and the upper call is 40 points away. This broken wing butterfly trade will generate $220 in premium. There is no loss potential on the downside, the worst that can happen is all the calls expire worthless and the trader gets to keep the $220 premium. On the upside, the maximum loss can be calculated by taking the width between the first two strikes (20) multiplied by 100 and subtracting the premium received (220). That gives us 20 x 100 \u2014 220 = $1,780 The maximum gain can be calculated as 20 x 100 + 220 = $2,220 although it's unlikely this amount would ever be achieved. The ideal scenario for the trade is that Tesla stock stays below 700 until expiration. For those with a neutral to slightly bullish outlook, a broken wing butterfly could be a nice way to trade Tesla stock. In terms of risk management, I would set a stop loss of 15%, or around $265. It's important to remember that options are risky and investors can lose 100% of their investment. This article is for education purposes only and not a trade recommendation.

    "article_text":"The Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled more than 400 points amid Moderna coronavirus vaccine news midday Monday, as Tesla stock raced to another all-time high before briefly reversing sharply lower. Nikola plunged as much as 27% after announcing a new, more limited deal with General Motors. On Monday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.3%, while the S&P 500 lost 0.9%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite slid 0.65% in midday trade. Moderna stock surged 17% in morning trade. Amid the coronavirus stock market rally, the tech-heavy Nasdaq is up 36.0% for the year through Friday's close. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 is up 12.6%, while the DJIA is up 4.8% year to date, through the Nov. 27 close. The cumulative total of worldwide Covid-19 cases confirmed since the start of the outbreak topped 63.1 million Monday, with more than 1.46 million virus-related deaths. Investors should continue to use the stock market's strength to buy breakouts. Start slowly with new purchases and see how they perform. If they work, then add more exposure. But if breakouts start to fail, then you can back away. The top payment processor retailer is the No. 10-performing stock on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, advancing 12.3% year to date. Chipotle Mexican Grill is approaching a 1,346.10 buy point in a double bottom with handle Monday. Shares lost over 1.5% in morning trade. On Nov. 18, shares broke out above a 466 buy point in an awkward cup with handle and are already nearly 30% from the buy point. On Monday, Tesla stock set a record high at 607.80 Monday morning. The new deal replaces the transaction announced on Sept. 8, 2020 and does not include a GM equity stake in Nikola. Nikola stock plunged 27% in morning trade, adding to Friday's 7.6% decline. Shares are more than 75% off their 52-week high. Apple stock continues to trace a new base with a 138.08 buy point. An early entry exists at 125.49. But the top Dow Jones stock is starting to show signs of significant weakness with a lagging relative strength line. The blue-chip giant is the No. 1-performing Dow Jones stock for 2020, with a 58.8% advance through Friday. Software giant Microsoft moved down 1.6% Monday.

    "article_text":"Our system is still bullish on Tesla. Our analysis of total returns and options market sentiment put Tesla in the top ten again on Wednesday. It was the only name from the May 28th top names cohort to appear in the November 25th cohort. Others, however, have suggested Tesla's valuation may have gotten ahead of itself.\u00a0 Bloomberg's Joe Wiesenthal noted that Elon Musk is now richer than Bill Gates.\u00a0 Wiesenthal also suggested that Tesla's spike was a bubble driven by desperate speculators.\u00a0 Maybe It's Worth Hedging Here Even if you're bullish on Tesla, it might make sense to hedge here, in the event the stock corrects in the near term (as it did earlier this year). Here's one way to do that.\u00a0 Crash Protection For Tesla I tried hedging 100 shares of Tesla against a greater-than-20% decline over the next several months two ways: ones with optimal puts (uncapped upside) and once with an optimal collar (capped upside). Uncapped Upside - Unavailable On Wednesday, if you scanned for an optimal put to hedge Tesla against a >20% drop over the next 6 months, you would have gotten this error message. What \"net cost exceeds threshold\" means is that the cost of hedging against a >20% decline was more than 20% of your position value. So, by buying that hedge, you would have incurred more than the loss you were looking to prevent. Capped Upside, Negative Cost If you were willing to cap your possible upside in Tesla at 38% over the next six months, this was the optimal collar to protect against a >20% decline over the same time frame. Here the net cost was negative, meaning you would have collected a net credit of $425, or 0.74% of position value, when opening this hedge, assuming, conservatively, that you bought the puts and sold the calls at the worst ends of their respective spreads. That worked out to an annualized cost as a percentage of position value of -1.32%. When Tesla Pulls Back If Tesla pulls back within the next few months, you'll be able to buy-to-close the call leg on the collar above for a lot less than you got for selling it, and you'll be able to sell the puts for a lot more. If you're still bullish on Tesla then, you sell those appreciated puts to buy more shares. See more from Benzinga \u00a9 2020 Benzinga.com. Benzinga does not provide investment advice.

Zoom Video earnings and guidance on Monday night, and ZM stock reaction, will be key as looming coronavirus vaccines loom over stay-at-home stocks. Dow Jones futures fell 0.45% vs. fair value. S&P 500 futures retreated 0.2%. Nasdaq 100 futures rose 0.25%. Dow futures improved slightly on the Moderna coronavirus vaccine news. China's official manufacturing index rose 0.7 point to 52.1 in November, better than expected and the highest in three years.

Confirmed coronavirus cases in the U.S. have hit 13.75 million, with deaths above 273,000. However, actual U.S. Covid-19 infections reached 52.9 million at the end of September and could be nearly 100 million now, according to a model developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The model assumes most coronavirus cases are mild or asymptomatic and are never tested. Los Angeles County announced a new stay-at-home order Friday as coronavirus cases soar in the nation's most populous county. The three-week order, starting Monday, bans most gatherings and limits capacity in retail stores and other non-essential businesses to 20% occupancy.

Meanwhile, the U.K. reportedly will OK the Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus vaccine in a few days, with the first vaccinations by Dec. 7. The European Union expects to OK vaccines by year-end. The stock market rally had a strong week, with the Dow Jones and Nasdaq composite both hitting record highs and the S&P 500 index on the cusp of all-time levels. Zoom Video stock jumped 7.3% last week after an 8.9% rally in the prior week. On Friday, shares broke a rather-steep downtrend, but closing just below its 50-day line. A move above the 50-day would offer a buying opportunity, but not until after Zoom Video earnings Monday night. CrowdStrike stock climbed 3.5% last week to 150.83. It's close to an official 154 buy point. It already triggered an early entry on Nov. 19, when CRWD stock rebounded from its 50-day line and broke above its 50-day line. It cleared another entry at 144.39. CrowdStrike earnings are due Wednesday night, along with Zscaler and Okta, which are also above early entries. Nio is likely to report monthly delivery figures late next week. For the past few months, Nio has released monthly figures on the second or third day of the following month. Production and deliveries have been rising dramatically. That's also true for Xpeng Motors and Li Auto, thought starting from a lower base. BYD is among the very largest EV makers in China. Investors are betting the Nio growth will remain strong. Nio stock has surged 247% since its late October breakout and a whopping 1,551% since May 22. Xpeng and Li Auto stock are up 327% and 243%, respectively, from their late summer IPO prices. In early 2021, Tesla will begin deliveries of the made-in-China Model Y, with the VW ID.4 coming out at about the same time. EV production in China is set to skyrocket. Tesla stock is up 17.8% from its 10-day line. That's not extreme. Also, it comes shortly after a powerful breakout, when hot stocks often can be bolt from moving averages without raising concerns for a while. Apple stock rising would provide a further lift to the market rally. It would be a good sign for Apple iPhone chipmakers such as Qorvo and Qualcomm stock. Both offer tight entries. If Apple stock and other megacaps gained momentum, that would fuel further market gains and bullish sentiment, perhaps hastening a pullback. So in the current climate, perhaps the stock market rally needs lukewarm action from tech giants to keep from overheating. As always, you should analyze your stocks, with a special emphasis on your winners. How extended are they from moving averages. You may want to consider partial profits on stocks that have been going nearly vertical for some time. There aren't a lot of good-looking setups right now, with some of the promising-looking stocks ready to report earnings, like CrowdStrike stock. So cast a wide net for your watchlists.

    "article_text":"Electric vehicles (EV) with zero emissions are the hottest trend in the auto industry. Amid heightening climate concerns, Germany has been doubling down on its efforts toward e-mobility. Auto companies of the country are under immense pressure to switch to clean mobility. This would require large sums of investment, which will be particularly difficult at a time when the firms are dealing with coronavirus-led sluggish vehicle demand. Amid the craze for red-hot EV maker Tesla TSLA and the increasing popularity of green vehicles, several automakers worldwide are revising their electric goals. Early this month, there were reports that the German government would offer a \u20ac2 billion stimulus to the nation\u2019s automotive industry in a bid to bolster the transition toward green vehicles. In addition to e-mobility and driverless technology, the funds will be allocated toward 3D printing parts, digitization of supply chains, and employee training between 2021 and 2024. The program would see the government covering nearly 60% of the transition costs for large companies and 80% for small to medium ones, in their efforts toward making the production facilities more environment-friendly. Germany is providing incentives to buyers of battery-powered EVs until the end of next year. Buyers of fully-electric cars with a price ceiling of \u20ac40,000 will be eligible for a grant of \u20ac9,000, one third of which will be funded by carmakers. Buyers of plug-in hybrids costing up to 40,000 euros will also get higher subsidies with 4,500 euros from the government and 2,250 euros from automakers. From 2022 onward, incentives would be reduced for the plug-in-hybrids but all electric cars will continue to get government support via grants till 2025. Germany also aims at fostering the creation of EV charging stations in as many locales as possible.\u00a0Every gas station in the country needs to install EV charging stations.\u00a0As part of Germany\u2019s chancellor\u00a0Angela Merkel\u2019s Climate Protection Program 2030, Germany aims to put 10 million electric cars on the nation\u2019s roads by 2030. Merkel has also set a goal of having\u00a0a million electric charging stations\u00a0across the country by 2030. Major German auto bigwigs like Volkswagen VWAGY, Daimler AG DDAIF and BMW AG BAMXF are focusing on radically electrifying their line-ups.\u00a0While BMW currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Volkswagen and Daimler carry Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see\u00a0the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. Volkswagen: Volkswagenremains committed toinvesting 33 billion euros in e-mobility by 2024. It also intends to spend around 14 billion euros in technology and autonomous driving. The plans are in sync with the firm\u2019s objective to go carbon neutral by 2050.The firm aims 40% of its global car sales to be fully electric by 2030.The deal between Volkswagen and Electrify America also highlights the automaker\u2019s aggressive stance with regard to the EV race.\u00a0 Scheduled for a global debut during the first quarter of 2021, Volkswagen\u2019s ID.4 electric SUV is based on the modular MEB platform.\u00a0The MEB platform, which supports the ID 3 and ID 4, will also provide the platform of the ID.5 coup\u00e9-SUV, ID.6 and ID Buzz. The company is set to develop a small electric car for the mass market in Europe. Under this project, Volkswagen anticipates to develop a 100% electric car, which is anticipated to be cheaper than ID.3 and will be available between 20,000euros and 25,000 euros ($24,000-30,000). Notably, Volkswagen plans to invest 15 billion euros by 2024-end to increase electrification efforts in China. The auto biggie aims to develop 15 new electric or hybrid models in China by 2025.The EVs will be based on the MEB architecture\u00a0at its two new dedicated modular electric drive matrix manufacturing facilities in China. The company has been collaborating with local battery suppliers in China to meet its future requirements. BMW: BMW is committed to selling more than 7 million EVs \u2014 comprising both hybrids and fully electric cars \u2014 by the end of next decade. The automaker targets two-thirds of the sales to come from fully electric vehicles. The company has pledged to invest around \u20ac30 billion toward e-mobility by 2025 end. By 2025, BMW is set to introduce nine new electric car models including iX3, i4 and iNEXT.The BMW i4and BMW iNEXT, which is an all-electric crossover, will come on the market in 2021, while the BMW iX3, an all-electric SUV, is due to go on sale before 2020 end. The BMW Concept i4 is claimed to be capable of running up to 600 km on a single charge. With a 150kW charger, the i4's battery can be charged to 80% in 35 minutes.\u00a0BMW iX3 will rely on a 74-kWh battery pack, which will enable it to travel up to 273 miles (440 kilometers), on a single charge. BMW iNext is expected to include hardware that could take the iNext to Level 3 autonomy at up to 80 MPH. Daimler: Daimler\u2014 Mercedes Benz\u2019s parent company\u2014 targets a carbon neutral new-vehicle fleet by 2039. The company desires its electrified portfolio\u2019s share to be 50% of its global sales by 2030. To keep up in the race to EV supremacy, Mercedes-Benz has decided to reorient its model lineup, inclining the fleet toward electric vehicles. The German automaker unveiled plans of producing bigger all-electric models first, eventually moving into its special divisions \u2014 AMG brand, its ultra-luxury Mercedes-Maybach brand and the G models. By 2025, the company will start adding smaller EVs to the lineup.\u00a0The company also revealed the four all-new EVs that will be developed on its upcoming platform \u2014Electric Vehicle Architecture (EVA). The first vehicle will be its fully-electric sedan called the EQS, set to debut next year that will be built on the company\u2019s new modular electric vehicle platform. The EQS will be an all-electric, S-Class-like luxury sedan. Following that will be the EQE, EQS-SUV and EQE-SUV. In sync with its electrification goals, Daimler Trucks aims to offer EVs in all its key sales region by 2022. Series production of the eCascadia and the Freightliner eM2 is slated to begin mid-2022 and in late 2022, respectively. Production of the eActros and eEconic is scheduled to commence in 2021 and 2022, respectively. Last year, it generated $24 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $77.6 billion.

    "article_text":"Last week, European Automobile Manufacturers Association disclosed commercial vehicle sales in Europe.\u00a0Registration of commercial vehicles in the European Union (EU) totaled 172,743 units for October, down 1.2% year over year, due to decline in demand for new pickups and buses partially offset by higher sales in light commercial vehicles. Commercial vehicles registration in EU during the 10 months ended October 2020 declined around 22.2% year over year to 1.4 million units.\u00a0All the EU markets recorded double-digit decline over the said time period, including the four major ones. While sales plunged 30.4% year over year in Spain, France witnessed a drop of 19.8% in commercial vehicle registrations. Sales in Germany and Italy slid 18.4% on a year-over-year basis. On the news front, General Motors GM and Tesla TSLA grabbed headlines as they issued recalls for 6 million and 9,500 vehicles, respectively. Meanwhile, supported by President-elect Biden\u2019s emphasis on electric vehicles (EVs), General Motors withdrew from Trump\u2019s litigation against California\u2019s emission rules. While General Motors currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Tesla carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see\u00a0the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. (Read the\u00a0Last Auto Stock Roundup\u00a0here) General Motors is set to recall around 6 million trucks and sports utility vehicles (SUVs) to replace defective Takata airbag inflators.\u00a0The U.S. auto giant\u2019s decision to recall came after the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration\u00a0(\u201cNHTSA\u201d) denied the firm\u2019s petition to avoid the callback. The agency has given the automaker a 30-day time period to come up with a plan on how it would work toward fixing the recall. The recall would come at a huge price and is expected to cost the firm around $1.2 billion. Affected vehicles include some of the best-selling models of General Motors \u2014 including Cadillac Escalade SUVs, GMC Sierra and Chevrolet Silverado pickups, GMC Yukon and Yukon XL SUVs, Chevrolet Tahoe and Suburban SUVs \u2014 manufactured between 2007 and 2014. In a separate development, General Motors\u00a0is pulling out of Trump\u2019s lawsuit against California over fuel economy standards. The company has also urged other automakers including Toyota and Fiat Chrysler to back out from Trump\u2019s legal attack on California\u2019s clean vehicles program.General Motors is working toward EV revolution and agrees with Biden\u2019s plan to rev up e-mobility development. Tesla has filed a safety recall for more than 9500 Model X and Y SUVs in the United States with the NHTSA due to manufacturing defects.Reportedly, the company has recalled 9,136 Model X SUVs built in 2015 and 2016 over chunks of the body that could get disconnected while driving due to the absence of primer and 437 Model Y SUVs over a possibly loose bolt that could cause separation of the upper control arm from the steering knuckle. Meanwhile, Tesla\u00a0signed a contract with LG Chem, per which the latter will exclusively supply rechargeable batteries for the Made-in-China Model Y Dual-Motor Long Range and Performance variants.\u00a0Earlier, it was speculated that the red-hot EV maker would pick China\u2019s top battery supplier CATL or Japan\u2019s Panasonic for supplying batteries for Model Y. However, with the latest contract, Tesla has ruled out both companies for supplying batteries for the Model Y. The following table shows the price movement of some of the major auto players over the past week and six-month period. In the past six months, all stocks have increased apart from AutoZone. Over the past week, all stocks gained apart from Toyota TM and Honda HMC. Notably, Tesla registered the maximum gains during both the said periods. Car enthusiasts will be keeping a close watch on November 2020 U.S. car sales, which will be coming out later this week. Investors in the auto sector would be closely tracking the monthly sales reports of auto biggies like Honda, Hyundai, Toyota Motor and Ford F among many others. Investors will keenly wait for updates on the long-pending deal between Nikola NKLA and General Motors. The companies have until Dec 3 to close the deal.\u00a0 Last year, it generated $24 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $77.6 billion.

(Reuters) - The National Labor Relations Board will file a complaint accusing Alphabet Inc's Google of unlawfully monitoring and questioning workers, who were fired for protesting against company policies and trying to organize a union, the former employees said in a statement on Wednesday. The NLRB did not respond to a request for comment. Google said it was confident in its legal position. \"Google has always worked to support a culture of internal discussion, and we place immense trust in our employees,\" it said. \"Actions undertaken by the employees at issue were a serious violation of our policies and an unacceptable breach of a trusted responsibility.\" The complaint follows a year-long investigation prompted by a petition by five people fired by Google after they led efforts to protest company policies and organize colleagues into a potential union. The Communications Workers of America union helped author the workers' charge. Google said the workers breached information security rules. Their firings capped two years of battling between Google and its workforce, particularly in the United States. At issue is how much input the rank and file has on which projects the company takes on and how it handles sexual misconduct and other workplace matters. One of the fired workers, Laurence Berland, described the NLRB's move as significant \"at a time when we're seeing the power of a handful of tech billionaires consolidate control over our lives and our society.\" Berland said the NLRB found Google violated labor law by placing workers on administrative leave and terminating one of them for accessing documents related to how the company polices internal forums. The agency also found unlawful Google's policies for limiting access to some documents and its practices for investigating workplace organizing, according to Berland. The NLRB did not include in its complaint several other allegations sought by the workers, who said they would appeal.

The way Salesforce founder Marc Benioff sees it, Salesforce (aided by new addition Slack) stands to become the \u201ccentral nervous system\u201d of the corporate office \u2014 in effect supplanting Microsoft and Google software. In large part, that view is why Salesforce paid an exorbitant 25 times revenue to acquire relative upstart Slack. That would be powered by Salesforce Customer 360, which allows the company to bring together fragmented parts of a business like sales, marketing, commerce, service, etc. into a single source of truth. Benioff believes that adding Slack as the new interface for Customer 360 is the \u201cicing on the cake.\u201d While the promise of the combination to crush email over time is in fact there, the Street doesn\u2019t think it will happen anytime soon despite Salesforce\u2019s heft in the enterprise domain. The fact is emails have become as ingrained in our society as turning on the water faucet for water.

    "article_text":"  The National Labor Relations Board is set to file a complaint against Google, finding it violated various labor laws last year, including engaging in unlawful surveillance of employees who were organizing and wrongfully terminating two of them. According to the employees and their counsel, the complaint asks the company to reinstate site reliability engineer Laurence Berland and security engineer Kathryn Spiers.  In a statement Wednesday, Berland said, \u201cThis complaint makes clear that workers have the right to speak to issues of ethical business and the composition of management.\u201d  \u201cOf course employees have protected labor rights that we strongly support, but we have always taken information security very seriously,\u201d a Google spokeswoman said Wednesday. \u201cWe\u2019re confident in our decision and legal position. Actions undertaken by the employees at issue were a serious violation of our policies and an unacceptable breach of a trusted responsibility.\u201d\u00a0 The NLRB has not yet returned a request for comment Wednesday.  The employees\u2019 lawyer, Laurie Burgess, noted that the NLRB did not include in its complaint other Google employees who were terminated. Those employees were protesting Google\u2019s work with the border patrol, which the NLRB\u2019s general counsel found was not protected under the National Labor Relations Act. \u201cWe intend to vigorously appeal the dismissed charges to the NLRB to ensure that the right to engage in this type of protected activity is not encroached upon,\u201d Burgess said in a statement. Spiers told MarketWatch on Wednesday that \u201cit\u2019s nice to see the correct outcome in my case but all of us were illegally fired. Google still has a lot of work to do, both in terms of organizing and in security work, [that] I\u2019d love to be a part of.\u201d The firings of Berland, Spiers and other employees last year came soon after Google hired IRI, whose website says it helps\u201dorganizations navigate workplace challenges.\u201d For the past few years, Google employees have protested the company\u2019s handling of sexual misconduct allegations against its leadership; its treatment of temporary and contract workers; its various contracts and bids for government work, including with Customs and Border Patrol; and more.  Some of the worker actions have been successful in getting Google to change course, including putting on hold plans to bring its search engine back to China, and ending mandatory arbitration at the company.

    "article_text":"By David Shepardson WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A federal appeals court said on Wednesday it will hear oral arguments on Dec. 14 on the government's appeal of an order that blocked a ban on Apple Inc and Alphabet\u2019s Google offering TikTok for download in U.S. app stores. U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols in Washington on Sept. 27 blocked the Commerce Department order hours before it was to prohibit new downloads of the Chinese-owned short video-sharing app. The appeals panel consists of Judge Judith Rogers, Patricia Millett and Robert Wilkins. All three were nominated by previous Democratic presidents. The Trump administration last week extended to Friday a deadline for Chinese TikTok parent ByteDance to sell TikTok's U.S. assets. The Trump administration contends TikTok poses national security concerns as the personal data of U.S. users could be obtained by China\u2019s government. TikTok, which has over 100 million U.S. users, denies the allegation. The administration previously granted ByteDance a 15-day extension of the order issued in August. President Donald Trump on Aug. 14 directed ByteDance to divest the app's U.S. assets within 90 days. Under pressure from the U.S. government, ByteDance has been in talks for months to finalize a deal with Walmart Inc and Oracle Corp to shift TikTok\u2019s U.S. assets into a new entity. ByteDance made a new proposal aimed at addressing the U.S. government\u2019s concerns, Reuters reported last week. The U.S. Treasury said last week the extension was granted to review a recently received \"revised submission.\" ByteDance made the proposal after disclosing on Nov. 10 that it submitted four prior proposals, including one in November, that sought to address U.S. concerns by \"creating a new entity, wholly owned by Oracle, Walmart and existing U.S. investors in ByteDance, that would be responsible for handling TikTok\u2019s U.S. user data and content moderation.\" U.S. District Judge Wendy Beetlestone on Oct. 30 blocked another aspect of a Commerce Department order scheduled to take effect Nov. 12 that would have effectively barred TikTok from operating in the United States. Beetlestone enjoined the agency from barring data hosting within the United States for TikTok, content delivery services and other technical transactions.

    "article_text":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The federal judge hearing the U.S. Justice Department's antitrust lawsuit against Alphabet's Google urged the government's lawyers to redraft a proposed protective order to remove potential barriers that could prevent the search and advertising giant from effectively defending itself. U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta objected in particular to what he said was a too-broad definition of highly confidential information that would be available only to Google's outside counsel without special permission. Arguing for Google, John Schmidtlein said he opposed the government's proposals. \"My experience is that they are going to designate all or nearly all of the information that they produce as highly confidential,\" he said in a pre-trial hearing by telephone. \"That's what's going to happen.\" In a filing, the government had defined highly confidential information as \"any confidential information that the parties or any third parties reasonably believe to be so competitively or commercially sensitive that it is entitled to extraordinary protections that a lesser designation cannot provide.\" Judge Mehta asked for the definition to be narrowed to something that went to the essence of the business. \"Could we agree to some definition that could capture that very narrow category of information?\" he asked. Judge Mehta asked the two sides to produce a revised protective order by Dec. 14 while companies, like Apple Inc or AT&T Inc, which produced the information, would have until Dec. 15 to respond. The Justice Department, which sued the search and advertising giant in October, put at the core of its antitrust case the billions of dollars that Google paid to be the default search engine on Apple's iPhones. Apple noted in its filing that sensitive data was used to write the complaint. Judge Mehta also indicated that he planned to put in the order penalties for attorneys who violate the protective order.

    "article_text":"Charles Schwab\u2019s Chief Investment Strategist Liz Ann Sonders joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss her market outlook for 2021, and why she thinks the economy has more rough terrain to traverse. JULIE HYMAN: Well, our next guest calls that vaccine or vaccines a light at the end of the tunnel but we're still in that tunnel. Liz Ann Sonders is joining us now. She is Charles Schwab Chief Market Strategist. Liz Ann, it's always great to see you. And you're out with an extensive note looking ahead to next year and what we can expect. And one of the things that we can expect is a vaccine or vaccines but it could be rocky in the interim. It doesn't look like it's necessarily going to be rocky for stocks in the very short term. What do you think? LIZ ANN SONDERS: Well, obviously from an economic standpoint, the virus represents a pull forward-- I mean the vaccine represents a pull forward of a return to maybe more normal economic growth but the virus and the resurgence of it and the impact it's having, some of the lockdowns we're seeing across the country, is having the effect of pushing down economic growth. Now the market has done an extraordinary job really since the beginning of this crisis of looking across the chasms, however large, created by the virus sort of to the other side. But I think near-term the biggest risk in the market is actually a function of what's happened in the market, the huge gains that we saw, especially in areas that had not been the pandemic winners in November, small caps having a record month. And what we saw in conjunction with the initial Pfizer vaccine news was a shift from sentiment having really only been frothy in certain pockets of the market, in the single stock options market by the newly minted day traders, and it became pervasively optimistic. So I think that enthusiasm, complacency, euphoria, whatever term you want to use, in and of itself represents a bit of a risk in the near term and could mean that even a fairly minor catalyst, which could be economic data, might be enough to put us into another one of these pullback phases that we've had three times since the low in March. BRIAN SOZZI: Liz Ann, just staying on that topic of the market perhaps being too frothy. Is it too frothy relative to where you see corporate earnings going, let's say in the back half of next year? LIZ ANN SONDERS: Well, it's funny, corporate earnings obviously are the denominator in your traditional PE equation and there's no question the forward PE is elevated relative to history, it's in line with where we were back in 2000. For some of the high momentum stocks, the big five, the valuation is not [INAUDIBLE] underlying fundamentals are much stronger now than was the case back in 2000. But valuation we think of as this fundamental indicator because it's got quantifiable components to it but the reality is valuation is as much a sentiment indicator as anything else. So I think the reason why we've seen such multiple expansion is tied into the enthusiasm that we're seeing in many sentiment measures. I think earnings look fine into 2021, especially starting in the second quarter when the comps get very easy. But we're going to need to see that stream of earnings persist because using things like 0% interest rates as a basis for justifying elevated valuations, that doesn't persist forever. But as long as sentiment stays elevated, it probably means valuations stay elevated. MYLES UDLAND: Liz Ann, you don't have a price target in the note but I think there's a suggestion in there that's very interesting on the index level when you look at the composition of leading sectors next year. You outline some of the dynamics around how much of the market cap is tied to the big five stocks versus the rest of the index. I'm wondering if you can kind of talk through for our viewers that thought as we look at next year's potential leadership type groups? LIZ ANN SONDERS: Sure. And we don't do year end price targets. Frankly, I think that that's an incredibly silly exercise. I'm not sure I understand the value of it, especially [INAUDIBLE] bolsters how the markets are and the folks that do it how often they have to change those targets throughout the year. But in terms of the concentration that really hit a peak in early September, at which point the big five, so Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Google and Facebook, had a 6,200 basis point spread in year-to-date performance over the other 495. At that point, which was the first sort of launch to new highs for the S&P and NASDAQ. Those five stocks on average were up 65% and the other 495 were only up 3%. I actually think that answers the question I get all the time, which is, is the stock market disconnected from the economy? That was sort of the reality at the time, a small subset of not just survivors but thrivers and still a lot of pain under the surface. Then we've had these series of rotations since early September and they've had growth to value flavor, they've had defensive to cyclicals, they've had COVID winners to COVID losers, it's been at the sector level. And I think heading into next year I think we'll likely see the market continue to try to find some leadership in the more cyclical areas but it's going to need that sustainable improvement in economic growth. In the meantime, I think that those rotations will happen in fits and starts and the best strategy for investors to take is not to try to anticipate them in advance but maybe rebalance more frequently and use those moves and give you the opportunity to sort of trim into strength in certain areas and add into weakness as opposed to trying to anticipate those rotations in advance. JULIE HYMAN: And you sort of illustrated that in your note, Liz Ann with what you called a quilt, which I quite liked, which was showing the different sectors, showing different leadership at different times in different colors as we saw that sort of rotation go through. Do you think that that sort of diversification that you're talking about should also go for different asset classes when you're talking about the periodic rebalancing? LIZ ANN SONDERS: Absolutely. In fact, the normal way to show a quilt like that and we have a version that's copyrighted, is asset classes. So US stocks, international stocks, components of the bond market, treasuries, corporate bonds, high yield, cash. But I decided to take a twist on it for the '21 outlook and look at the sectors on a monthly basis. But I actually think that diversification becomes an easier sell and arguably already has been in a year like this year. We've been in this mindset of eh, why be diversified, US equities are the only game in town. Even this year, the total return on long bonds and medium term bonds, 30 year treasuries, 10 year treasuries, the total return, not the yield, the total return, is actually better than the total return on the S&P 500. You've had some non US markets outperform. And we think as we head into 2021, diversification will pay dividends not just within an asset class like US equities across sectors, but across asset classes, including international, non US. Not that they're going to take over the leadership and leave the US in the dust but I think correlations coming down means it will be an opportunity to actually add some value in portfolios through that long held discipline of diversification that has maybe justifiably been shunned in the last several years. JULIE HYMAN: Liz Ann, it's always great to get your thoughts, especially as we look ahead to 2021. And I also love, forget about the price targets, it is sort of it's a tough game to strategize. LIZ ANN SONDERS: I get it. JULIE HYMAN: Liz Ann Sonders, thanks so much. Charles Schwab. LIZ ANN SONDERS: Thanks. My pleasure. JULIE HYMAN: Chief Market Strategist. Appreciate it."

    "headline":"All the Happiness Money Can Buy in the Winter of Covid-19",
    "url":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/happiness-money-buy-winter-covid-143001654.html",
    "article_text":"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- As the saying goes, money can\u2019t buy happiness. That certainly seems to be true in 2020 \u2014 rates of depression and anxiety are up, even though many households have more cash on hand than usual. Savings rates in the U.S. spiked to a previously unfathomable 34% in April and sat at a still-high 14% in September. Savings in the U.K. have also hit record highs, with households saving 29% of their disposable income. There must be some way to use this extra cash to brighten our spirits. Even if gyms, cafes, hotels and restaurants aren\u2019t safe. Even if travel is restricted. Even if the best things in life are free. After all, in a pandemic, those free activities \u2014 like visiting a house of worship or game nights and dinner parties \u2014 can be deadly. To find out whether it\u2019s realistic to throw money at the problem of Covid-induced unhappiness, I called Elizabeth Dunn, a psychology professor at the University of British Columbia and a coauthor of \u201cHappy Money: The Science of Happier Spending.\u201d One area she says is definitely worth the money: exercise. Physical activity is really good for our emotional well-being; it can be just as effective as medication in treating depression, studies have found, even if it\u2019s just 30 minutes of walking three times a week. And, bereft of other distractions, lots of us did get more exercise over the summer \u2014 cycling, running, even inline skating. But winter\u2019s arrival may make moving around more expensive. One does not need to splurge on a Peloton (although many have \u2014 in September, the company reported quarterly sales had soared 172%). To prepare for indoor winter workouts, I bought a used bike trainer on Facebook Marketplace and a pair of weights from Amazon for a total of about $200. Bodyweight classes, yoga and Pilates don\u2019t take much, if any, special equipment, and can be found free on Instagram or YouTube, or for a small monthly fee through apps like MindBody. But don\u2019t give up on going outside, says Dunn. A raft of studies have linked spending time in nature to better mental health. And, of course, Covid transmission rates are far lower outdoors, making it possible to socialize relatively safely as long as you stay outside. As the days and nights get colder in the Northern Hemisphere, it may be necessary to get creative to remain in nature, and this introduces a new category of things to buy: stuff to keep us warm. Think beyond firepits and patio heaters, which at this point may be available only on backorder. A wool base layer? A down sleeping bag? Those chemical hand-and-toe warmers you bring skiing? Some outdoor gear companies even make battery-heated jackets. I\u2019ve been staying warm(ish) while socializing outdoors by keeping a travel mug of scalding herbal tea at my side. Another way to invest in happiness is to buy experiences. We\u2019re happier buying experiences than material goods, several studies have suggested. Indeed, pre-pandemic, it was hard to go a week without reading about the \u201cexperience economy\u201d or millennials\u2019 commitment to buying memories rather than stuff. It\u2019s just that buying things to do has gotten a lot harder. \u201cIt\u2019s still possible to buy experiences, but they might look a little bit different,\u201d Dunn says. \u201cWe don\u2019t usually think of buying takeout as an experience, but on Saturday nights I\u2019ve been ordering takeout from the kind of fancy restaurant I would normally be going out to for date night.\u201d It makes the day feel special, and it\u2019s something to look forward to all week. And indeed, she says, \u201cpart of the reason experiences are powerful is anticipation.\u201d Sometimes looking forward to something is more pleasurable than the experience itself. That\u2019s why Dunn and a friend are planning a trip to a dude ranch in the summer of 2021. \u201cWe could probably wait to start planning this trip,\u201d she admits, but filling out their shared Google doc is giving them something fun to do now. Another way to buy an experience is to buy more free time. People feel much happier when they outsource tasks they find unpleasant, Dunn\u2019s research shows, but guilt often stops us from doing this. After all, it\u2019s work we could be doing ourselves. Nonetheless, she says, if you hate cooking \u2014 or are just getting sick of having to do it day after day after day \u2014 go ahead and buy some ready-made meals. If you\u2019d rather not do the snow shoveling, hire someone to plow the driveway. You\u2019ll also be supporting local businesspeople. The last and best way to buy happiness: Help others. A tranche of Dunn\u2019s research focuses on what academics call \u201cprosocial spending\u201d and its powerful effects. Charitable donations bring us joy; we feel even better when we can see the tangible effects of our giving. So make a donation to your local food pantry, or send a DoorDash order to a friend going through a hard time. Deliver a homemade dinner to a lonely relative, even if you have to leave it on their porch. \u201cGiven how many people are suffering right now, those of us lucky enough to have full-time, paying jobs might consider using our money to help other people out,\u201d Dunn says. \u201cMy research has shown that\u2019s a really good way to buy happiness for ourselves.\u201d How do you gauge how much generosity is enough? An old rule of thumb: Give until you feel good. This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.

    "url":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/alphabet-ups-self-driving-game-140802630.html",
    "article_text":"Autonomous driving technology, which combines semiconductors, simulation software, electronics testing equipment and measuring instruments, predictive algorithms and most importantly advancing AI, is constantly gaining steam in the data-driven world with bigwigs like Alphabet GOOGL, Amazon AMZN, Baidu BIDU, Intel INTC, and Apple AAPL taking interest in it.Notably, Alphabet\u2014 the most popular company in the driverless vehicle space \u2014 is continuously putting strong efforts to sustain the leading position of its self-driving unit namely Waymo, which is testified by its latest move.Waymo partnered with Transportation Research Center \u2014 the provider of independent vehicle test facility and proving grounds \u2014 in a bid to build a new advanced testing environment for Waymo Driver, its autonomous driving technology, in East Liberty, OH.Apart from this, the company is gearing up to open its research and development facility for trucking in Menlo Park, CA, early next year. This facility will also provide accommodation for the company\u2019s fleet of test vehicles.With these developments, the company plans to incorporate Waymo Driver successfully not only into cars like Jaguar I-PACE but also Class 8 trucks. This, in turn, is likely to bolster Waymo\u2019s growing initiatives being made for its autonomous truck fleet.We believe that the latest move poises Alphabet well to further capitalize on the growth prospects present in the booming self-driving space.According to a report by Grand View Research, the demand for autonomous vehicles on a global basis in 2020 is projected at 6.7 thousand units. Further, the figure is expected to witness a CAGR of 63.1% between 2021 and 2030. \u00a0 Alphabet, with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), takes the driverless technology and vehicle game to another level, intensifying the competition among the above-mentioned players who are also leaving no stone unturned to expand their presence in the autonomous driving market.Nevertheless, Waymo\u2019s aggressive stance is expected to help the company in staying ahead of the pack. Apart from the latest move, the company recently relaunched its robo-taxi ride-hailing service, with no human attendant, in Phoenix, AZ.Further, Waymo plans to start the road testing of its driverless fleet of trucks in a new hub in Dallas, TX. Notably, the company\u2019s driverless robotic Peterbilt 579 trucks will be tested initially.Furthermore, its Volvo partnership to develop self-driving electric vehicles for ride-hailing services remains a major positive.Additionally, the Latent Logic buyout remains noteworthy, which is making the simulation technology of Waymo more advanced and realistic. This, in turn, will likely strengthen the behavior prediction capability of Waymo. Alphabet on the back of its growing Waymo initiatives poses a serious challenge to Intel, Apple and Amazon.However, concerted efforts being made by these companies in the self-driving space should not be ignored.Intel is gaining on partnerships of its self-driving unit, Mobileye.Recently, Luminar Technologies teamed up with Mobileye to develop self-driving vehicles. Notably, the former\u2019s lidar will be utilized for the latter\u2019s first-generation Level 4 Mobility-as-a-Service pilot and driverless fleet.Apart from this, Mobileye is gathering steam to hit the streets of Dubai by 2022 on the heels of its multi-million dollar partnership with Al Habtoor Group. Per the terms of the deal, the Mobileye system will be deployed into a fleet of 1000 automotive robo-taxis.Further, Intel is strongly benefiting from the low power consumption of Mobileye chips and the ability to create maps for self-driving systems via its Road Experience Management platform.Amazon on the other hand agreed to acquire Zoox, a developer of self-driving technology. This remains a major positive for the company in the autonomous driving space. Further, this Zacks Rank #3 company\u2019s investment in Aurora, a startup that develops technology to power fully-autonomous vehicles, remains noteworthy.Meanwhile, Apple, with a Zacks Rank #3, remains well-poised to reap benefits from the promising self-driving technology space on the back of its Drive.ai buyout. The solid database of Drive.ai related to road conditions, signals and traffic is helping Apple in innovating the software for driverless vehicles.Additionally, Baidu, which currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), is benefiting from the expansion of Apollo Go Robotaxi service that covers almost 700 kilometers across China, and features about 100 pick-up and drop-off stations across several residential as well as business areas.You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Further, the company recently showcased its Fully Automated Driving \u2014 a technology which makes vehicles self-drive eligible without the presence of a safety driver, at its annual tech event namely Baidu World 2020. From thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months to come. From those 5, Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all.You know this company from its past glory days, but few would expect that it\u2019s poised for a monster turnaround. Fresh from a successful repositioning and flush with A-list celeb endorsements, it could rival or surpass other recent Zacks\u2019 Stocks Set to Double like Boston Beer Company which shot up +143.0% in a little more than 9 months and Nvidia which boomed +175.9% in one year.Free: See Our Top Stock and 4 Runners Up >>"

    "article_text":"Box Co-Founder and CEO Aaron Levie joins 'Influencers with Andy Serwer' to discuss regulation of America's biggest tech companies and how President Trump's immigration policy affects business in Silicon Valley. AARON LEVIE: There is a question of, should digital platforms continue to be completely unfettered in how they work and how they operate and how they can compete, or should there be some guard rails that are meant to protect consumers as well as ensure fair competition? And I do think that it's a real risk if we don't create an environment where you can build massive companies. Then I do think that China and India will be more significant threats for us. But again, I think this is something that requires a surgical approach, as opposed to broad-based solutions like let's break up these companies. I don't think that will actually accomplish much. And I think that's more of a distraction than the underlying issue. ANDY SERWER: Do you have any idea of how the Biden administration is considering moving forward on this front, both with regard specifically to the tech companies and with regard to that relationship to China? AARON LEVIE: Well, I think, you know, from the limited interactions that I've had with parts of the team over there, the thing I'm very optimistic about is the thoughtfulness of the approaches that the Biden administration will take. I think we've been in an environment for four years where we've only had these very heavy-handed and, again, kind of blunt force types of solutions to global trade, to internet censorship, to things like immigration. And when I look at the Biden administration, already the team that has been assembled as well as just, I think, the general thoughtfulness that Biden has as well as Vise President Harris has on these issues, I think we're going to see a very, very different kind of approach, one that is much more nuanced to these topics, one that takes in more feedback and collaboration from the tech industry as well as other industries that are impacted. And I think we'll end up having, again, much better either legislation or policies that are enacted. If you just take, for example, the immigration issue that we've been facing, the Trump administration has really dealt with immigration in a very, very archaic type of fashion that doesn't really take into account the fact that America needs talent coming in from all around the world to come build amazing companies and to work at our amazing companies. And Trump has set us back many, many years in terms of being able to bring talent into this country. And that's just an example of these small decisions, seemingly, on the administration side that end up having a massive ripple effect over time, where the next Apple, the next Google, the next Facebook doesn't get created here. It gets created in China or India or another country. And that is going to set our economy back many, many years if we're not able to accelerate some of these solutions. So again, I have a lot of faith that the Biden and Harris administration will be much more effective at dealing with these issues."

    "article_text":"Recent financial results have been anything but good. Last quarter, gross bookings were down 68% and revenue was down 58% from the year prior, and the company burned about $1 billion in cash.  Yet Expedia's stock has rallied over 200% since its March lows. It's now actually trading above its pre-pandemic price. Is this travel stock still a buy today on renewed vaccine momentum? Image source: Getty Images. With positive recent vaccine news, investors are now looking at travel-related companies based on \"normalized\" earnings power, which will likely come in 2022. In that respect, one might assume Expedia will head back to its 2019 levels of revenue by then -- perhaps slightly better or worse, depending on how it competes against rivals. That's a massive deal. In 2019, Expedia made $903 million in operating income, so the cost cuts alone could double Expedia's earnings power relative to last year, even if it just gets back to previous levels of revenue.  Just because operating income could double doesn't mean Expedia's earnings per share will. During 2020, Expedia has had to take on lots of additional debt to get through the current cash-burning COVID-19 period. That has basically tripled the company's interest expense relative to last year. Additionally, the company sold $1.2 billion in preferred stock back in the second quarter, which came with warrants to purchase some 8.4 million shares at a strike price of $72. Since Expedia's stock price is now near $126, it's safe to say those warrants will be exercised.  Taken together, it appears Expedia's interest expense will rise to about $460 million next year.  Assuming $1.8 billion in operating income, $460 million in interest expense, and a 21% tax rate, Expedia's net profits could reach $1.06 billion in 2022. Expedia's share count will also likely increase from 141.3 million last quarter to around 150 million should its preferred stock get converted. If all of this goes to plan, Expedia could earn $7.06 per share once things get back to \"normal.\" In 2019, Expedia traded anywhere from a high-teens to a low-twenties P\/E ratio. It's probably reasonable to value Expedia at around $140 per share or so, about 10% above today's share price. Additionally, with COVID-19 cases raging, Expedia will likely continue posting losses well into next year. It will be a more heavily indebted company when this is all over. Thus, risks and rewards seem roughly balanced today. If you have a positive view of Expedia's new management team and its ability to win market share, there could be additional upside in the stock. But if you think the travel world will get more competitive on the other side of the crisis, there may be better stocks to buy in today's market.\u00a0"

    "url":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/twitch-tiktok-help-breakthrough-artists-120055644.html",
    "article_text":"(Bloomberg) -- With concert venues closed, musical careers must be forged on streaming platforms instead. It\u2019s been an awful year for the majority of artists who make most of their income from gigs and touring. Yet a small but growing number are harnessing the latest tech to break through on Spotify, YouTube and TikTok. Musicians like Jayda G and RAC have bounced back from canceled tours to secure Grammy nominations with the help of apps like Distrokid, Submithub.com and fortunes.io. The tools help artists to distribute and market their work, share out royalties, break into popular playlists and identify which songs resonate most with listeners. These capabilities were long the preserve of big companies such as Vivendi SA\u2019s Universal Music Group, Sony Music Entertainment and Warner Music Group. Now technology is making it easier than ever to be a successful independent musician -- distributor AWAL said hundreds of them are now making more than $100,000 per year from streaming. Merlin, a not-for-profit that negotiates distribution rights and royalties on behalf of independent labels and rights-holders representing self-publishing musicians, accounts for around 15% of the market. The organization has seen its share of major digital music platforms grow by 3.5 percentage points during the pandemic, its Chief Executive Officer Jeremy Sirota told Bloomberg. Some 68% of independent artists have reported making more music during lockdowns, according to a survey by Midia Research. It said the number publishing their own music direct to fans grew 31% between 2019 and September this year to 4.7 million. \u201cThese artists, who tend to be earlier in their career, are playing by different rules to established artists by releasing directly themselves or doing label services deals with next-generation record labels,\u201d said Midia analyst Mark Mulligan. Here are some independent artists who are getting by, even flourishing, in the shadow of coronavirus: RAC The Portland-based musician and producer (real name Andre Allen Anjos) was on the cusp of an album tour in March when the live scene went into deep-freeze. Now he\u2019s livestreaming sessions to paying fans on Amazon.com Inc.\u2019s Twitch and using crowd-funding platform Patreon to give listeners access and bonus perks for a monthly fee. His sessions have been averaging 600,000 views a week. \u201cYou cannot play enough festivals in a week to reach that number,\u201d he said. In some ways, livestreaming has an edge over physical performance. Multiple cameras give RAC\u2019s fans an insight into his playing technique that they\u2019d never get in a live concert. \u201cI can really bring it down and have some semblance of intimacy. It feels like a new medium.\u201d Chris Webby The Connecticut rapper is having the biggest success of his career with almost 60 million streams on Apple Music and Spotify since early March. \u201cI\u2019m not saying I can pull the strings some labels can, but in theory I can operate similarly and I own my music and that is the biggest deal for me,\u201d said Webby. The key to his success is volume and consistency: By uploading a new track every other Wednesday for nine months of the year, he\u2019s managed to acquire 1.5 million monthly listeners. Webby is nostalgic for the traditional approach still loved by many musicians: the slow, careful crafting of an album that you take on tour. Now \u201cit\u2019s all about singles and algorithms,\u201d says Webby. \u201cYou have to learn that and stay on the cutting edge of these platforms.\u201d He has different agents to distribute his work via YouTube and Spotify and uses back-end apps that analyze which songs are clicking with listeners, which he uses to pick the songs for his next album. \u201cThere\u2019s one for Apple Music, another for Amazon Music, so one day I\u2019ll find a song is doing incredibly well and decide to shoot a video for it.\u201d And Webby is always mixing up his references: \u201cTwo days ago I dropped a song with a new singing approach, something like Johnny Cash, that sounds like nothing I did before.\u201d Ryan Celsius Celsius\u2019s laid-back brand of lo-fi vaporwave has caught on with stressed listeners during lockdowns. He self-releases his work and manages other musicians in the same genre including Speechless, whose monthly listens have roughly doubled since February to around 2 million, helped by the lockdown-themed song \u201cIsolation.\u201d \u201cSpeechless is constantly collaborating with different artists and labels and spreading himself out so there\u2019s no single point of failure,\u201d said Celsius. He said solo artists are also collaborating more, or starting their own labels using amuse.io, a distribution platform that manages accounting and complex royalty splits. Another, Submithub, lets musicians boost their streaming profiles by connecting with curators of the most popular playlists. Fortunes.io tells an artist when their track has been put on a Spotify or Apple playlist so they can drum up more noise for their work on social media. \u201cCovid has created a situation where everyone is almost on the same playing field -- the impact of a large artist\u2019s label on marketing is a lot smaller,\u201d said Celsius. Jayda G When lockdowns canceled her sets in Tokyo, San Francisco and Glasgow, the Canadian-born, London-based DJ ran a series of livestreamed \u201cVirtual Get Downs\u201d with donation links to raise money for the venues and local charities. The resulting social media publicity helped Spotify listens for Jayda G\u2019s latest EP surge eleven-fold, earning her second spot in the platform\u2019s largest electronic editorial playlist, mint. She used the Apple Inc.-owned music discovery app Shazam\u2019s \u201cUnlock\u201d feature, and offered exclusive behind-the-scenes video content to give fans an incentive to add her tracks to their playlists on the service. \u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P."

    "article_text":" Every weekday evening we highlight the consequential market news of the day and explain what's likely to matter tomorrow.  The fund does have a higher-than-average fee of 1.66%, but Korngiebel says that\u2019s because capacity is limited\u2014as a firm, Wasatch is quick to close funds. Also, researching very small companies is more intensive than digging into larger-cap firms, where information is more readily available. Last year, the Salt Lake City-based Korngiebel, 55, says, he flew more than 140,000 miles, mostly domestically, as part of the research process. He spent his career in small-cap funds. Before joining Wasatch in 2015 and becoming Micro Cap\u2019s lead portfolio manager in 2017, he worked at Columbia Management\u2014now known as Columbia Threadneedle Investments\u2014and Montibus Capital Management.\u00a0 The fund defines microcaps as firms with a market value of less than $1.5 billion, or smaller than the largest company in the Russell Microcap index. Micro Cap doesn\u2019t automatically sell holdings if they surpass the $1.5 billion threshold, which is why the fund has a higher-weighted average market cap and median market cap than its benchmark, Korngiebel says. \u201cWe are really investing with the idea of what is the company going to look like over the next five years,\u201d he says. Korngiebel divides the portfolio into two buckets: disruptive companies with a good chance of doubling in size in about three years, and firms with predictable growth rates that may double in about five years.

    "article_text":"(Bloomberg) -- An Ohio startup that helps hospitals automate routine tasks is now valued at $1.5 billion after a funding round led by Tiger Global Management. Olive AI Inc. received an investment of $225.5 million in the round, which included new investors Alphabet Inc.\u2019s GV, Sequoia Capital, Dragoneer Investment Group and Transformation Partners, according to a statement. Existing investors General Catalyst and Drive Capital also joined the round. Columbus-based Olive has now raised more than $380 million in financing in the past nine months and roughly $445 million since its inception in 2012. The company\u2019s software is used by more than 600 hospitals in the U.S. to analyze data for insurance claims and supply chains. \u201cIt is the de facto payments company for health care,\u201d said Hemant Taneja, managing director at General Catalyst. \u201cHealth care is as big of a category as e-commerce.\u201d Taneja, who is also an investor in payments software company Stripe Inc., said he thinks Olive could chart a similar path in the health-care category, playing a pivotal role in transactions between health-care providers and insurance companies.

The startup is part of Ohio\u2019s growing technology ecosystem. Auto insurance platform Root Inc., also based in Columbus, raised $724 million in an initial public offering in October. Lane said that he believes that launching in Ohio gave the company an advantage because there was less competition for hiring the best local talent. He said Olive has now expanded beyond the state and has a distributed workforce, something that will continue after the pandemic. The newly raised capital will be used for more hiring, as well as product development, he said.

    "url":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/hewlett-packard-enterprise-leave-silicon-020027107.html",
    "article_text":"(Bloomberg) -- Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co. will move its headquarters to Houston, a major shift for a founding Silicon Valley computer maker now seeking haven in a lower-cost region while making way for a new generation of nimbler mobile and consumer-web giants. The company said it was already building a \u201cstate-of-the-art\u201d new campus in Houston, the fourth-largest U.S. city. HPE also reported quarterly revenue that topped analysts\u2019 predictions, suggesting that businesses are upgrading their data-center hardware during the coronavirus pandemic. HPE was created in the 2015 split of one of the consummate Bay Area technology companies, Hewlett-Packard Co., which was founded in 1939 in a Palo Alto garage. The move to Texas comes amid a broader re-evaluation, motivated by pandemic-enforced work-from-anywhere arrangements, by individuals and companies opting to leave behind a region known for its high cost of living and difficult commute. Chief Executive Officer Antonio Neri has been working to turn around HPE, a maker of servers, storage hardware and networking gear, which had reported declining revenue in all but one quarter since separating from personal-computer maker HP Inc. Neri is reducing the company\u2019s overhead costs, exiting unprofitable businesses and chasing the hybrid-cloud market, in which businesses store and process some of their information in corporate data centers and some with public cloud companies. Sales in the quarter ended Oct. 31 were little changed from a year ago at $7.2 billion. Analysts, on average, estimated $6.9 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Profit, excluding some items, was 37 cents a share in the fiscal fourth quarter, HPE said Tuesday in a statement. Analysts had projected 34 cents. The spread of Covid-19 and the economic slowdown it triggered had suppressed demand for networking and computer hardware and services. Now that companies have settled into remote work for many employees, they\u2019re investing in gear to make that more efficient. \u201cThe global pandemic has forced businesses to rethink everything from remote work and collaboration to business continuity and data insight,\u201d Neri said in the statement. \u201cWe saw a notable rebound in our overall revenue, with particular acceleration in key growth areas of our business.\u201d Hewlett Packard Enterprises follows a handful of other companies exiting at least in part from the San Francisco Bay Area. Newly public data-mining provider Palantir Technologies Inc. moved to Denver from Palo Alto earlier this year, while besieged e-cigarette maker Juul Labs Inc. is relocating to Washington from San Francisco. Charles Schwab Corp. said last year its headquarters will shift from San Francisco to Westlake, Texas. Many individuals, encouraged by laissez-faire work-from-home rules and put off by the cost of living in California, are also on the move. As Hewlett Packard Enterprises and its predecessor company receded from prominence in recent years, newer companies -- such as Alphabet Inc., Apple Inc. and Facebook Inc. -- have taken their place in the Silicon Valley pantheon. Fiscal fourth-quarter sales increased 6% from the prior period. In the current quarter, HPE projected that profit, excluding some items, will be 40 cents to 44 cents. That compares with an average analyst prediction of 35 cents, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The company said sales will decline from the preceding period at a percentage in the mid-single digits, in line with normal seasonal patterns. A decline of 5% would indicate sales of about $6.84 billion. That compares with an average analyst estimate of $6.63 billion. The company will keep its technology innovation hub in San Jose, at a relatively new building, CEO Neri said on a conference call with analysts. Administrative work will be centered at the new Texas headquarters. Consolidating more expensive facilities in California will lead to real estate cost savings, he said. No staff reductions are associated with the move, HPE said in the statement. The company has locations in several cities in Texas, including Austin and Plano, and has more than 2,600 workers in Houston, according to a statement from the office of Governor Greg Abbott. HPE shares were little changed in extended trading after closing at $11.20 in New York. They have declined 29% this year.

    "headline":"Salesforce to Buy Software Maker Slack for $27.7 Billion",
    "url":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/salesforce-buy-software-maker-slack-215340812.html",
    "article_text":"(Bloomberg) -- Salesforce.com Inc. agreed to buy Slack Technologies Inc. for $27.7 billion in cash and stock, giving the corporate software giant a popular workplace-communications platform in one of the biggest technology deals of the year. The transaction, Salesforce\u2019s largest-ever acquisition, is expected to close by the end of July, the San Francisco-based company said Tuesday in a statement. Slack investors will receive $26.78 for each company share as well as 0.0776 share of Salesforce -- representing a 55% premium to Slack\u2019s price on Nov. 24, the day before reports about deal talks between the companies. Salesforce Chief Executive Officer Marc Benioff has orchestrated more than 60 acquisitions in 21 years, taking his company from dot-com era upstart to a titan of cloud computing. The Slack deal would give Salesforce, the leader in programs for managing customer relationships, another angle of attack against Microsoft Corp., which has itself become a major force in internet-based computing. Microsoft\u2019s Teams product, which offers a workplace chatroom, automation tools and videoconference hosting, is a top rival to Slack. \u201cTogether, Salesforce and Slack will shape the future of enterprise software and transform the way everyone works in the all-digital, work-from-anywhere world,\u201d Benioff said in the statement. Stewart Butterfield, Slack\u2019s co-founder and CEO, will continue to run the business as a Salesforce unit when the deal is completed. He said he is excited to join the company that sparked the cloud revolution. \u201cThe opportunity we see together is massive,\u201d Butterfield said in the statement. \u201cThis is the most strategic combination in the history of software, and I can\u2019t wait to get going.\u201d Salesforce\u2019s shares declined about 4% in extended trading after closing at $241.35. The stock has jumped 48% this year. Slack\u2019s shares were little changed after closing at $43.84. The stock has almost doubled in 2020, with about half of that gain coming since the acquisition talks were reported. Salesforce, among the first of the fast-growing cloud software companies when it went public in 2004, strives to generate year-over-year revenue increases of more than 25%. Slack, which is expected to increase its sales almost 40% to $877 million this fiscal year, could help that effort. Slack, launched in 2013, went public via a direct listing in 2019. Bloomberg News and other publications reported that companies including Amazon.com Inc., Microsoft and Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google expressed interest in buying Slack at various times when it was still private. Benioff for years has turned to acquisitions to keep his product lineup fresh. He has set an annual revenue goal of $35 billion for Salesforce by fiscal 2024, compared with $17 billion in fiscal 2020. The company bought analytics firm Tableau Software Inc. in an all-stock deal valued at $15.3 billion last year, which was Salesforce\u2019s biggest acquisition at the time. The year before, in 2018, Benioff took over MuleSoft Inc. for $6.5 billion. Benioff, who just three months ago said he didn\u2019t foresee making any acquisitions given the economic environment, praised Chief Operating Officer Bret Taylor for organizing the deal with Butterfield, then pitching him on the idea. \u201cWhat\u2019s very exciting is this vision that Stewart and Bret have put together,\u201d he said in a conference call. \u201cIt\u2019s a wow.\u201d Taylor, who sold his productivity software company, Quip, to Salesforce in 2016, said Slack will be deeply integrated with the app maker\u2019s software suite to help its customers\u2019 employees. \u201cIt really is about facilitating this all-digital, work-from-anywhere world, to enable team selling, to enable people in a contact center to swarm on a case digitally whether or not you\u2019re in the same building, to enable marketers to plan a campaign,\u201d Taylor said. Separately, Salesforce projected revenue will grow about 17% in the current period to as much as $5.675 billion. That will be the slowest quarter of year-over-year sales growth in 11 years for the software maker, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Profit, excluding some items, will be 73 to 74 cents in the period ending in January, missing analysts\u2019 projections for 86 cents. Sales climbed 20% to $5.42 billion in the fiscal third quarter, which ended Oct. 31, the company said in a statement. Profit, excluding some items, was $1.74 a share, compared with analysts\u2019 average estimate of 75 cents. The company also said Chief Financial officer Mark Hawkins will retire effective Jan. 31, and be replaced by Amy Weaver, currently president and chief legal officer. Hawkins will remain an adviser through October 2021, Salesforce said. Salesforce ownership will mark a new era for Slack, a tech upstart with the lofty goal of trying to replace the need for business emails. The cloud-software giant may be able to sell Slack\u2019s chatroom product to existing customers around the world, making it even more popular. Slack said in March that it had reached 12.5 million users who were simultaneously connected on its platform, which has grown more essential while corporate employees work from home during the coronavirus pandemic. Slack has boosted revenue in the midst of Covid-19, but the company\u2019s billings have been underwhelming because of shaky demand from small and mid-sized clients. Meanwhile, use of Microsoft Teams has jumped during the pandemic, and Slack has taken issue with the company\u2019s business tactics. In July, Slack complained to the European Union that Microsoft had broken antitrust law and should be investigated. \u201cMicrosoft has illegally tied its Teams product into its market-dominant Office productivity suite, force installing it for millions, blocking its removal, and hiding the true cost to enterprise customers,\u201d Slack said in a statement at the time. Microsoft, which integrates its products with Slack, has denied any wrongdoing. While the boards of both companies approved the deal, Slack will be required to pay Salesforce $900 million if Slack\u2019s directors change their recommendation or back out to accept a \u201csuperior proposal,\u201d according to a regulatory filing. Bank of America Corp. served as Salesforce\u2019s financial adviser. Qatalyst Partners and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. advised Slack.

    "url":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/salesforce-splashy-slack-deal-isnt-221752671.html",
    "article_text":"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Salesforce.com Inc. is betting big on the staying power of remote work by buying Slack Technologies Inc. But is the splashy takeover of the workplace messaging leader worth the risk? I don\u2019t think so. Late Tuesday, Salesforce announced a definitive agreement to acquire Slack for about $28 billion in cash and stock, confirming recent reports by the Wall Street Journal and others. The value of the purchase tops Salesforce\u2019s previous largest deal, last year\u2019s $15.7 billion purchase of Tableau Software, marking founder and CEO Marc Benioff's biggest wager yet. There are legitimate reasons Salesforce may want to acquire Slack. Its software has gained in popularity and become an indispensable tool for many businesses that were forced by the coronavirus crisis to quickly adopt new technologies to maintain operations and enable their employees to work remotely. Surveys show office workers intend to keep using the software even after the pandemic subsides. However, expanding outside of Salesforce\u2019s core business could be a distraction for management. The company\u2019s best acquisitions have provided a distinct specialized solution related directly to its customer relationship management (CRM) software \u2014 technology that helps companies sell products. These include the purchase of ExactTarget\u2019s email marketing service for $2.5 billion in 2013, Demandware\u2019s e-commerce platform for $2.8 billion in 2016 and Tableau Software\u2019s data analytics last year. All of these transactions resulted in obvious synergies related to sales and marketing. Slack doesn\u2019t do any of those things. Instead, it\u2019s a software product for the common office worker. To illustrate the difference, Slack\u2019s main competitor \u2014 Microsoft Teams \u2014 is bundled inside the tech giant\u2019s suite of office productivity tools that includes Outlook, Word, Excel and PowerPoint. Slack\u2019s end user isn\u2019t quite the same as the sales manager, business analyst or marketing executive that uses Salesforce\u2019s specialized products. As a result, the integration and future cross-selling opportunities aren\u2019t as obvious as the other add-on purchases. Slack would help Salesforce compete with Microsoft on its own turf. But giving up roughly 13% percent of its market value to purchase an unprofitable company in a relatively disparate area seems inherently risky. Salesforce has tried for years to gain traction in the workplace-messaging space with its Chatter product to no avail. Its failure may speak to how different CRM software and services are, compared with general office tech tools. Investors seem to be in this skeptical camp, with the company\u2019s shares falling about 9% since deal talks were first reported last week. There are other technology companies that would make far better suitors for Slack, such as Amazon.com Inc., which already provides Slack with cloud-computing infrastructure and video-calling technology as part of a partnership. Amazon could also add the workplace-messaging product to the vast array of services Amazon Web Services offers its customers. An even better match would be Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google. Like Microsoft, Google sells a cloud-based productivity suite called Google Workspace that includes word processing, email and other applications. The Google bundle lacks a comprehensive messaging and collaboration tool that is comparable to Microsoft Teams, making Slack the perfect fit. And with Microsoft dominant in the category \u2014 it has about 270 million office workers paying for its productivity suite \u2014 a Google-Slack combination has a far better chance of increasing the level of competition in this key market. Unlike Salesforce, the revenue synergies are also clear cut: Slack\u2019s best-in-class product would make Google\u2019s productivity cloud offering a more attractive proposition. In contrast, Salesforce lacks the ability to bundle Slack with any truly complementary services, raising the danger it may wither inside the company. Neither Amazon nor Google would likely stand a chance at trying to snatch away Slack, given the rising antitrust concerns over Big Tech\u2019s power, influence and competition-squelching acquisitions. But this begs the question of why Salesforce is immune to such scrutiny. Salesforce has bought more than 60 companies since its inception and now has become a giant in its own right with a valuation of more than $200 billion. Given the risks this deal entails for Salesforce, investors may to want to root for regulators to block this deal as well.

    "article_text":"(Bloomberg) -- From Washington to Beijing, governments are trying to strike the right balance between enabling technology innovation and preventing giants like Google and Facebook Inc. from suffocating rivals. Now India is experimenting with a framework for financial technology that\u2019s certain to provide lessons worldwide -- succeed or fail. The country\u2019s unique approach is to decree limits on fintech competitors from the start: No single player can grab more than 30% of total payments transactions. Every company also has to use India\u2019s open payments platform, guaranteeing interoperability so money can be transferred between any of more than 100 traditional banks and digital services like Google Pay -- all without fees. That structure, unveiled in November, gave India\u2019s regulators the confidence to approve a new payment service from WhatsApp, the Facebook unit\u2019s initial effort to enable digital payments for more than a billion users worldwide. Although WhatsApp has more than 400 million users in India who may adopt the service, it won\u2019t be able to crush rivals like the local champion Paytm because of the government caps. \u201cIn the interest of public good, we\u2019ve disallowed a winner-take-all approach,\u201d said Dilip Asbe, chief executive officer of the National Payments Corporation of India, a coalition of set up by the country\u2019s largest retail banks to build and oversee the infrastructure. His group will stop new user registrations at a company, local or foreign, as it nears the 30% limit. India has celebrated its methodical approach as a way to get things right from the beginning, especially after Chinese regulators intervened at the last moment to derail what would have been a record initial public offering from Ant Group Co. China\u2019s digital payment services have been celebrated for their innovations and surging popularity, but the field is dominated by Ant, an affiliate of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., and Tencent Holdings Ltd. That duopoly in digital payments allowed Tencent and Ant to expand into adjacent fields like lending and wealth management, which threatened the traditional banking sector and triggered Beijing\u2019s dramatic disruption. In India, the digital payments sector is projected to grow to $1 trillion by 2023, creating a potent new platform for additional financial services. \u201cBoth countries have established themselves with best practices for others to learn from,\u201d said Arnav Gupta, analyst at Forrester Research Inc. \u201cIndia has set itself as a worthy example for digital payments but there are aspects of financial services which are yet to be streamlined and digitized.\u201d China, on the other hand, is a more mature fintech market, where its hands-off approach led to complications later. \u201cThat relaxed approach came at a cost,\u201d said Gupta. Concerns that WhatsApp could dominate payments in India stem from the enormous number of people who fire up the app to message, call and share videos -- all in 10 different Indian languages. Even street corner push-cart vendors take orders on the service. \u201cAap whatsapp mein order bhej do\u201d or \u201csend me your order via WhatsApp,\u201d is a common refrain. Google and Amazon.com Inc. also have enormous user bases in the country. The Facebook service, in pilot mode for nearly three years, got the green light to expand last month. Earlier this year, Facebook pumped $5.7 billion into Jio Platforms, a digital services business set up by Mukesh Ambani, India\u2019s richest and most influential businessman. Jio\u2019s e-commerce service would work closely with WhatsApp to help small merchants and buyers transact seamlessly, Ambani said at the time. Sending money would become as easy sending a message, Facebook\u2019s co-founder Mark Zuckerberg said after receiving the go-ahead. \u201cWe\u2019ve built it using India\u2019s Unified Payments Interface which makes it easy for anyone to accept payments across a lot of different apps,\u201d he said said in a video message.India mandates that companies use its UPI platform so payments can be sent among all services, including those from Facebook, Amazon, Walmart Inc., Paytm and any new upstart. Zero user fees are also required. \u201cThat will increase the competitive intensity in payments,\u201d said Nandan Nilekani, the architect of India\u2019s biometric identity system on which the payments infrastructure is built. \u201cIndia is showing the way by mandating zero-fee at the front end and bringing the rigor of risk management at the back end.\u201d India is already the world\u2019s second-largest internet base, after China, with a half a billion users and its growth is drawing global players like Facebook and Amazon. The coronavirus pandemic is accelerating the move to e-commerce and other online services. The number of digital payment transactions is projected to grow 15-fold over the next two to three years to about a billion a day, said Asbe of the National Payments Corporation of India.His organization is still discussing the final mechanisms for capping the market share of various players. \u201cWe will work out details in a few months after industry consultations,\u201d said Asbe. \u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P."

Marc Runyan, a former engineer with NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, lists his title on the professional social network as senior quantum research scientist at Amazon and describes his role as \u201chelping to design and build a quantum computer for Amazon Web Services.\u201d A spokesman for Amazon Web Services, the company\u2019s cloud-computing group, declined to comment. Runyan didn\u2019t immediately respond to a LinkedIn message. Proponents of quantum computing say the technology will exponentially improve the processing speed and power of computers, enabling them to simulate large systems and drive advances in physics, chemistry and other fields. Rather than storing information in binary 0s or 1s like classical computers, quantum computers rely on \u201cqubits\u201d, which can be both 0 and 1 simultaneously, dramatically increasing the amount of information that can be encoded. The technology is in its infancy and largely limited to prototypes and demonstrations. Scientists say practical, widespread applications for quantum computers are likely years away.

Developing its own quantum computer would let Amazon more closely mirror the approach taken by its major cloud rivals. International Business Machines Corp. first made a quantum computer available to the public in 2016 and has rolled out regular upgrades. Last year, Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google said it had built a computer that\u2019s reached \u201cquantum supremacy,\u201d performing a computation in 200 seconds that would take the fastest supercomputers about 10,000 years. But with the rivalrous spirit that has characterized the race to build a quantum computer, IBM cast doubt on Google\u2019s claim. In a blog post, it said that a simulation of Google\u2019s task could be done in 2.5 days on a conventional computer with enough hard drive storage, not 10,000 years. Amazon announced its entry into the arena last year and, in August, launched its first quantum computing service, called Braket, which helps cloud clients experiment with quantum algorithms run on AWS. Once they\u2019ve designed their algorithms, clients can choose to run them on quantum processing systems built by other companies, including D-Wave Systems Inc., IonQ Inc., and Rigetti Computing. At the time, Amazon noted its interest in developing hardware, but stopped short of announcing plans to build its own computer. One person briefed on Amazon\u2019s plans, but not authorized to discuss them, says the company is using a superconductor model, a similar approach to that used by Google and IBM, among others. The person said Amazon has been on a hiring spree to staff its quantum computing group. Last year Amazon announced the launch of the AWS Center for Quantum Computing, which aimed to bring together researchers from Amazon, the California Institute of Technology and other academic research institutions to develop new quantum computing technologies. \u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P."

It also prevents users from installing apps outside the Google Play Store via the Google Play Protect service, and allows businesses to remotely wipe all the company data from phones that are lost or stolen. As Google explains, smaller companies often handle customer data on mobile devices, but many of today's remote device management solutions are too complex for small business owners, and are often complicated to get up-and-running. Android Enterprise Essentials attempts to make the overall setup process easier by eliminating the need to manually activate each device. And because the security policies are applied remotely, there's nothing the employees themselves have to configure on their own phones. Instead, businesses that want to use the new solution will just buy Android devices from a reseller to hand out or ship to employees with policies already in place."

    "url":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/yc-backed-buildbuddy-raises-3-140008602.html",
    "article_text":"BuildBuddy\u2019s funding round makes it clear that choppy market conditions and a move away from in-person demos did not fully dampen investor interest in YC\u2019s March batch of startups, though it\u2019s far too soon to tell if the group will perform as well as others, given how long it takes for startup winners to mature into exits. During that time he became accustomed to building software in the Google style, namely using its internal tool called Blaze to compile his code. It\u2019s core to how developers at Google work, Simonarson told TechCrunch. \"You write some code,\" he added, \"you run Blaze build; you write some code, you run Blaze test.\" What sets Blaze apart from other developer tools is that \u201copposed to your traditional language-specific build tools,\u201d Simonarson said, it\u2019s code agnostic, so you can use it to \u201cbuild across [any] programming language.\u201d So what does BuildBuddy do? In product terms, it\u2019s building the pieces of Blaze that Google engineers have access to inside the company, for other developers using Bazel in their own work. In business terms, BuildBuddy wants to offer its service to individual developers for free, and charge companies that use its product. This origin story underlines something that BuildBuddy has that early-stage startups often lack, namely demonstrable enterprise market appetite. Lots of big companies use Bazel to help create software, and BuildBuddy found its way into a few of them early in its life. Simply building a useful tool for a popular open-source project is no guarantee of success, however. Happily for BuildBuddy, early users helped it set direction for its product development, meaning that over the summer the startup added the features that its current users most wanted.  Simonarson explained that after BuildBuddy was initially used by external developers, they demanded additional tools, like authentication. In the words of the co-founder, the response from the startup was \u201cgreat!\u201d The same went for a request for dashboarding, and other features. Even better for the YC graduate, some of the features requested were the sort that it intends to charge for. That brings us back to money and the round itself. BuildBuddy closed its round in May. But like with most venture capital tales, it's not a simple story. According to Simonarson, his startup started raising the round during one of those awful early-COVID days when the stock market dropped by double-digit percentage points in a single trading session.  BuildBuddy's goal was to raise $1.5 million. Simonarson was worried at the time, telling TechCrunch that it was his first time fundraising, and that he wasn't sure if his startup was going to \"raise anything at all\" in that climate.  But the nascent company secured its first $100,000 check. And then a $300,000 check, over time managing to fill out its round. So what happened that got the company from $1.5 million to just over $3 million? The investor that put in $300,000 wanted to put in another $2 million. The company talked them down to $1.5 million at a higher cap (BuildBuddy raised its round using a SAFE), and the deal was done at those terms. The startup initially didn't want to raise the extra cash, but Simonarson told TechCrunch that at the time it was not clear where the fundraising environment was heading; BuildBuddy raised back when startup layoffs were a leading story, and a return to high-cadence VC rounds was months away.  So BuildBuddy wound up securing $3.15 million to support a current headcount of four. It intends to hire, naturally, lower its comically long runway and keep building out its Bazel-focused service."

    "article_text":"(Bloomberg) -- Amazon.com Inc.\u2019s cloud computing division is adding products that help customers maintain local control of their data, a bet that could help it fend off rivals Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google. Amazon Web Services has a wide lead in selling on-demand software services, a business built on the economies of scale provided by vast server farms in data centers. Last year, the company went small, for the first time selling services for customers\u2019 own data centers. The move acknowledged demand from customers requiring faster processing and the need to meet regulatory requirements by storing information inside their own walls. AWS bolstered that bet on Tuesday, kicking off its annual customer conference with two new variants of Outposts, the server rack product it started selling a year ago. While prior versions required customers to buy a complete, filing cabinet-sized server rack, new versions come packaged as small as a single, 1 3\/4-inch-tall unit that customers can plug into their own data center setup. Amazon also announced versions of its software for containers, a popular way to make applications and related software run reliably. The company also outlined plans to expand Local Zones, or cloud servers staged in big cities, closer to some customers than Amazon\u2019s sometimes-remote server farms in places like Ohio, Oregon and Virginia. Launched last year in Los Angeles, new zones were made available to customers on Tuesday in Boston, Houston and Miami. A dozen more will go online next year, AWS said in a statement. In a reminder to major chipmakers that Amazon is developing cheaper semiconductors, the company disclosed new variants of on-demand processing power. Trainium, a new chip that helps train algorithms to detect patterns in data, will be available next year. AWS also said it will offer more services based on its own Graviton chips that juice data speeds -- potentially costing customers 40% less than if they used processors from Intel Corp. or Advanced Micro Devices Inc. Amazon also introduced graphics technology using AMD chips that it said will \u201cprovide the industry\u2019s best price performance.\u201d Nvidia Corp. dominates the market for graphics chips used in data centers. In comments kicking off the company\u2019s live-streamed re:Invent customer conference, AWS Chief Executive Officer Andy Jassy said the company realized a few years ago that it would have to develop its own chips if Amazon wanted to continue to cut costs for customers. But he went to stress that \u201cwe have a deep relationship with both Intel and AMD, and we will for the foreseeable future.\u201d The company also announced new Intel-powered computing services on Tuesday. \u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P."

    "article_text":"COVID-19 has changed the way we do our shopping. More people are shopping for more things online instead of going into stores, accelerating the shift to e-commerce. And these changes seem fairly permanent, as the pandemic has brought in new customers and opened new retail verticals for online shopping. With more shopping happening online, marketers are quickly following consumers. That's good for both Google and Amazon.\u00a0 Image source: Amazon. But considering the high purchase intent of Amazon searches, the influx of digital advertising in categories like consumer packaged goods or electronics heavily favors the retailer instead of the general search engine. Amazon has been eating into Google's share of product searches for years. And those searches are some of its most valuable. With Amazon seeing an influx of spending on its marketplace and growth in Prime memberships during the pandemic, investors should expect its share of product searches to have followed suit. And with more searches, there are more opportunities to sell ads. The growth of Amazon's advertising business has supported strong operating margin expansion and ought to continue to support Amazon's bottom line as consumer packaged good ad spending keeps shifting online. But Google is under investigation of antitrust practices in its dealings with Apple. What's more, Apple is reportedly developing its own search engine, which could compete with Google. If Google's forced to relinquish its hold on Safari's default search engine in one way or another, it's not like Google's share of search traffic goes to zero on the iPhone. Google still has many popular services on the iPhone despite competing default services from Apple. Google currently dominates mobile search, thanks in part to its partnership with Apple. If that relationship changes for any reason, it could put a damper on Google's ability to take the majority of search ad growth on mobile as it has in the past. It's worth reiterating the accelerating shift to e-commerce will benefit Google at least some, even if it's not as much as it benefits Amazon. Furthermore, Google and other digital advertisers will see benefits from accelerations in cord-cutting, leading to more marketers seeking digital advertising. In fact, eMarketer now expects search advertising to grow faster long-term than it forecast pre-pandemic. Google still has a lot of growth ahead, but it has a few hurdles in its way. Meanwhile, Amazon's runway is clear for accelerating advertising revenue."

    "article_text":"The Covid-19 pandemic has hit the travel industry hard, including online travel agencies, or OTAs. Yet these were already facing headwinds going into the crisis, argues Bernstein, meaning that investors should proceed with caution.  Analyst Richard Clarke initiated coverage of OTAs with a cautious long-term view on Tuesday.  The fact that \u201cwe, lodging analysts rather than internet analysts, are covering the OTAs is in itself telling,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThese are no longer 30%+ growth disrupters, but established parts of the travel landscape, in even competition with their underlying product and themselves being disrupted by tech intrusion, notably from Google (GOOGL).\u201d Revenue from hotels was 23% in the decade ended 2019, but is set to slow to the mid-single digits post-pandemic, Clarke says, with branded hotels wrestling back control of their distribution. Other travel-related experiences, from home rentals to flight packages often carry lower margins, and while selling experiences\u2014from group tours to wine tastings\u2014may be most promising in terms of profit, Tripadvisor is so far the only company heavily invested in this market.  That is part of the reason that Tripadvisor is his only Outperform-rated stock of the group, with a $35 price target. He initiated coverage of Booking with an Underperform rating, with a price target of $1,720, and Expedia at Market Perform, with a $113 target. With the shares of all three having recovered from their lows, Clarke warns that the stocks are \u201ccurrently being valued on past glories not future realities ...with only Tripadvisor offering any reopening upside.\u201d  While Booking (formerly Priceline) has historically been the strongest performer of the group, he warns that its heavy exposure to lodging means that it will likely suffer the most.  Expedia is facing the same headwinds, but it can offset this to a degree with its business-to-business flight revenues and cost savings.  Booking was up 1.7%, to $2,062.66 in trading Tuesday, and has gained 0.4% year to date; Expedia was 1.2% higher, at $125.98 with a 16.5% rise in 2020; Tripadvisor was up 5%, to $27.40 and is down nearly 10% year to date.

    "article_text":"Anaplan's third-quarter revenue increased 28% year over year to $115 million. This figure topped management's outlook from a few months ago for revenue to be as much as $110 million. Customers and prospective customers are still being affected by the pandemic, but Anaplan continues to make progress getting itself back to pre-crisis growth rates. Revenue increased 45% last year, its first full year as a public company after a late-2018 IPO.  Within the quarterly total, subscription revenue to the company's cloud-based ERP software, which an organization uses to plan everything from finances to inventory management to a marketing campaign, grew 31% from a year ago and made up over 91% of total sales. CEO Frank Calderoni said that some 60% of new bookings came from existing customers, reflecting the challenging environment for large organizations trying to free up enough budget to execute on their digital transformation.  It looks like those companies that have already embarked on their new digital journey remain in the best position to engage with Anaplan. But new deal activity is still unthawing after the freeze in the spring during the worst of the economic lockdowns. Calderoni said customers paying Anaplan at least $250,000 a year increased to 417, a 29% increase from a year ago. Image source: Getty Images. In total, Anaplan had over 1,500 customers at the end of Q3. This is still a small firm that competes in a large ERP software space worth tens of billions in global spending every year, with tech giants like Oracle, SAP, and Workday dominating the space. The market could be seeing better times soon as COVID-19 vaccines and treatments could lead to gradual normalization of the economy.  In spite of current challenges, Anaplan is making progress and setting itself up for years of growth in a post-pandemic world. Calderoni and his team said they talk to many executives a week, and end-to-end operational changes to adapt to the new digital era are top of mind for these executives. Anaplan figures to be part of those changes -- both current and future. Its software helps connect data throughout an organization to help planning teams make better decisions and predictions and untether them from reliance on past results in lieu of more timely cloud-based information. It hasn't been only existing customers propelling Anaplan's recent acceleration in growth, though. The company said one of the top 50 largest companies in the U.S. recently tapped Anaplan's ERP software to manage a more than 10,000-member salesforce, with everything from new-hire onboarding to sales forecasting getting plugged into the planning software. A healthcare distribution company with over $15 billion in annual revenue also signed up to update its processes for the new digital era. Besides replacing some of its legacy ERP rivals, Anaplan said some of these new deals are retiring decades-old software developed by IT teams in-house. \u00a0 However, as it focuses on serving large organizations, Anaplan's rebound is still tied to a greater economic recovery. Management had positive news on that front, though. Fourth-quarter revenue is forecast to be as much as 22% higher than last year, but preliminary fiscal 2022 guidance (for the 12 months ended Jan. 31, 2022) was also provided. At $550 million in sales, it implies a nearly 24% increase over this year's forecast results. Again, this is a preliminary estimate for next year subject to change, but it certainly looks like Calderoni and team are upbeat as progress on a vaccine is being made.  With a market cap currently at $9.5 billion, Anaplan stock trades for 21 times current-year expected sales and 17 times the preliminary forecast for next year. Given management's expected growth, shares look like a fair value to me. And if a vaccine means more economic normalization, I think Anaplan's actual results could be even better than projected. The company's balance sheet shows $297 million in cash and equivalents and no debt, a respectable war chest for the company to continue executing on its growth strategy. I remain optimistic on this cloud software vendor's prospects."

The big tech names have cashed in on the stay-at-home trade that has thrived during the coronavirus pandemic.  \u201cLet\u2019s remember what actually took us to these record levels in the first place because those stocks are still the best in show,\u201d he said.

    "article_text":"As a cloud data platform, Snowflake leverages the elasticity and performance of the public cloud to enable customers to unify and query big data. Its cloud-native architecture offers three major service layers: Essentially, Snowflake customers feed massive sets of raw data into the cloud and receive back analytics-ready data, useful for distilling business insights and delivering revenue-generating services. With a highly scalable model that allows customers to pay per use, the company has proven exceedingly popular as more and more businesses turn to cloud-based warehousing solutions. Image source: Snowflake. In one year alone, Snowflake has more than doubled its number of customers, with existing customers increasing their usage significantly over time. Consequently, the company's revenue has increased rapidly, growing 121% year over year by the second quarter of fiscal year 2021. On a yearly basis, Snowflake experienced a 174% increase in revenue from fiscal year 2019 to 2020. And all of this is attributable to its competitive advantages. Despite this, Snowflake has a growing number of customers. Why? The company takes innovation and customer needs very seriously, consistently adjusting its offerings to accommodate where its competitors currently do not. Snowflake's competitive offerings include integration of diverse data types, massive scalability without sacrificing performance, simultaneous use cases and users, and extreme ease of use.\u00a0 Image source: Getty Images. Indeed, possibly its greatest competitive advantage comes from its easy-to-use platform and cloud-based architecture. Just as Shopify attracts businesses for its turn-key solutions, Snowflake's made-for-the-cloud platform entices businesses with its scalable, high-performance data-warehousing solution. However, as a company that runs on its competitors' public clouds, Snowflake exposes itself to some unique risks. Any outages or security issues will affect Snowflake as well. Furthermore, the company is extremely young, with a limited operating history, and therefore has very little data on which to forecast its future viability. It has also posted deepening operating losses, as the company experiences the costly growth spurt so typical of today's high-value tech stocks. Given this, from fiscal year 2019 to 2020, Snowflake has delivered net losses of $348 million, even though it boasts a gross profit margin of 61%. "

    "article_text":"Apple and Alphabet are the two exceptions that have grown roughly 10% in November, still less than Nasdaq's 11.8% growth.\u00a0 \"These stocks have gone out of style in the Wall Street fashion show, lamentably,\" Cramer said \u2014\u00a0adding that smart money signifies a rotation into small-cap stocks or any stock that needs a roaring economy to thrive. The FAANG stocks are one of the biggest gainers this year due to the benefits of stay-at-home. As the market keeps an eye on the COVID-19 vaccine developments, it rotates out of the stay-at-home stocks into the cyclical stocks that would benefit from the economy's reopening. \"There are some stocks that become a lot less attractive when the world goes back to normal, but not FAANG,\" Cramer said. He called FAANG stocks in-charge of their destinies, unfazed from the economic downturn. White House leadership or the vaccine timeline does not affect these companies as they are not cyclical. Facebook:\u00a0The management has changed its narrative from a profit-seeking company to a product-based company helping small and medium-sized businesses affected by the pandemic. Cramer said that many executives had told him that advertising on Facebook gives the best bang for the buck, and it is a bargain for small- and medium-sized businesses. Cramer said Facebook has a great defense if regulators turn in on the company as it has become essential for small and medium business. The social media giant can also move into the payments space. Facebook gained 5% in November. Apple:\u00a0Analysts are bullish on Apple, citing the strength of the latest iPhone 12. Cramer reiterated that Apple's service revenue stream keeps growing and is still in infancy as Apple has the most loyal customer base. According to Cramer, the rapidly declining dollar is bullish for Apple and the next year's earnings estimates are low. Cramer said that Apple does not get enough credit for the wearables. \"They own the wearables space,\" he added. Cramer said that Apple should be valued like a tech company instead of a consumer packaged goods company. Alphabet:\u00a0Google parent Alphabet keeps growing, be it YouTube monetization or Google Cloud services. Once the vaccines are out and travel opens, Alphabet becomes an advertisement play.\u00a0 \"FAANG stocks are not going anytime soon,\" if you ask Cramer. Price Action:\u00a0On Monday, FB shares closed 0.30% lower at $276.97, AAPL closed 2.11% higher at $119.05, AMZN closed 0.85% lower at $3,168.04, NFLX closed lower by 0.13% at $490.70, and GOOG closed 1.81% lower at $1,760.74.

    "article_text":"What Happened: The tax on digital services will stay in place until nations can agree on a unified approach on taxation on the tech giants, the country\u2019s finance department said, as per Reuters. The tax would be levied beginning Jan. 1, 2022, and is expected to raise revenues for Canada\u2019s federal government to the tune of $2.6 billion (CAD 3.4 billion) over a period of 5-years. \u201cCanada will act unilaterally, if necessary, to apply a tax on large multinational digital corporations, so they pay their fair share just like any other company operating in Canada,\u201d said the country\u2019s Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland, according to Reuters. In addition to the digital tax, foreign-based vendors with no presence in Canada will also have to collect sales tax on products such as mobile apps, video gaming, and streaming they sell in the country. This measure is expected to raise $924.75 million (CAD 1.2 billion) over five years, as per Reuters. The Canadian government also reportedly plans to levy sales tax on short-term accommodation rentals and said digital platforms that facilitate such rentals currently do not have to impose the taxes. Why It Matters: Ottawa has chosen to move unilaterally in the imposition of the digital tax as it is concerned over delays in reaching a multilateral agreement being worked on by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, noted Reuters. The imposition of digital taxes by foreign governments has evoked threats of retaliation from the outgoing Donald Trump administration, Reuters reported. Price Action: On Friday, Facebook shares closed 0.3% lower at $276.97, Amazon shares closed 0.85% lower at $3,168.04 and Alphabet Class A and Class C shares closed 1.83% and 1.81% lower respectively at $1,754.40 and $1,760.74.

    "article_text":"More from WWD Courting businesses has become a crucial priority for Facebook. That\u2019s been clear from the moment Facebook turned Messenger into a major arena for service chatbots in 2016 and its expansion of shopping and communications tools on Instagram, Facebook\u2019s main platform and WhatsApp this year, among other features. The company\u2019s not done yet. In a major clue that Kustomer \u2014 which manages customer interactions across channels \u2014 will spread far and wide across the Facebook family of apps, the announcement post was penned by Dan Levy, vice president of ads and business products, and Matt Idema, chief operating officer of WhatsApp. Facebook is far from alone in trying to own online customer service and business chat using human and automated tools. Both Apple and Google have unleashed features aimed at retailers and other businesses, through tools such as Apple Business Chat for Messages and Google\u2019s Business Messages, which connect through its maps and search features. The latter expanded to cover all types of businesses this summer, generating new interest among retailers. Last month, H&M partnered with Nuance Communications \u2014 one of the major speech recognition and artificial intelligence-driven voice platforms \u2014 and Google\u2019s Business Messages to connect the fast-fashion company\u2019s virtual and live chat agents to Google Maps and Search. Meanwhile, as social media continues morphing into the digital era\u2019s version of shopping malls, rival companies are increasingly recognizing the fundamental need to pin down the customer service factor. Snap Inc. seems to have signaled as much with its own acquisition of Voca.ai, an AI and voice developer that caters to call centers, earlier this month. What complicates things for Facebook is that it encompasses more than a single channel or platform. But that\u2019s what makes Kustomer so attractive. Its specialty is wrangling so-called \u201comnichannel\u201d customer communications, as Levy and Idema described it. According to the post\u2019s authors, this acquisition is just the beginning. \u201cKustomer is one of many solutions in this arena,\u201d they wrote, \u201cand we\u2019ll continue to support the numerous options that businesses have to integrate their CRM platform of choice with our messaging services.\u201d"

    "article_text":"Stocks fell Monday as investors gave back some of last week\u2019s gains, which sent the S&P 500 and Nasdaq to fresh record highs and the Dow above 30,000 for the first time ever. Katie Nixon of Northern Trust Wealth Management and Vance Howard of Howard Capital Management joined Yahoo Finance Live to discuss. ADAM SHAPIRO: We've got three minutes to the closing bell. We want to invite into the stream Katie Nixon, Northern Trust Wealth Management, as well as Vance Howard. He's CEO at-- PM at Howard Capital Management. Good to have you both here. Jared Blikre also on deck. Katie, let me start with you. As we head into the closing bell, three P's you say people should pay attention to-- politics, policy, and the pandemic. Let me just ask you about the pandemic. Is that now rearview mirror and priced in? KATIE NIXON: Partly priced in, I think. But I do think, as we see continued good news on the rollout of the vaccine, the market will continue to react positively to that. So although I think a lot of the initial vaccine news is priced in, I think as we see the implementation, we'll get some more bumps. JEN ROGERS: Vance, the market's not perfect. Sometimes we overshoot to the downside. Other times, we overshoot to the upside. Do you think that we're in one of those moments right now, where we may have gotten a little bit ahead of ourselves, a little bit over our skis right now? VANCE HOWARD: No, not at all. We trade the HCM byline. So we're a mathematically driven shop. The math is pointing to us that we may have another 4% or 5% upside in December alone before the end of the year. The HCM byline is extremely positive right now. Being a quantitative measure that it is, it's usually been very, very accurate. We see the market pushing higher or even into the first and second quarter of 2021. Yeah, there's going to be some bumps in the road. There are bumps in the road in every single market that we have. So any pullback that we see in the market we see as a buying opportunity. ADAM SHAPIRO: Let's go to Jared Blikre as we get ready for that closing bell because, Jared, this has been a really terrific month despite what appears to be a down day today. One day does not a market make. JARED BLIKRE: That's right. And it is the last day of the month. Normal to see selling when we have the markets up this much. You look at the Dow. It's up 11.7% for the month. NASDAQ has some nice gains, a little bit less, 11.6%. S&P 500 sitting on 10 and 1\/2%. And a lot of these are setting some pretty big milestones. It's going to be the best month for the S&P 500 since 1987. So not too shabby right there. We are seeing some profit taking, especially in crude oil and the energy market. Now we've seen energy up. This is the second best month we've ever seen for energy, coming off a little bit today. I do want to note the US dollar index has been especially weak. If we take a look at a three-month chart here, interesting candle. This is called a hammer candle. Not final until we get confirmation the next day. But if this is an interim low, got to keep in mind that rising dollar could pressure equities in early December. But we just do have these incredible tailwinds at our back from the December seasonality, the so-called Santa Claus rally at the end of the month into the first few trading days of January. So just taking a look at the NASDAQ 100 here, we can see some pretty good leadership, at least for Apple. That's up 2 and 1\/2%. The other majors, big mega cap names, those are down. Google's off about 1.76% here. Amazon is off about 1%. Facebook off about 20 basis points. Tesla was in the green. Now off about 3% for the day, but nice gains for the month. Here's the closing bell. [BELL] JEN ROGERS: That's going to be good for November. Wow, the whole month now in the books, as we've been just going through the numbers here, looking at the Dow for our best November since 1928. You do have to remember, it was down today. On the day today, energy our worst performing sector, red across the board, except for the XLK. These are the S&P sectors, looking like it's going to eke out the smallest of gains, up just about 7\/10. Also, S&P 500, NASDAQ, best month since April 2020. So the story here, we've had rotation. We've had re-opening trade. We've had optimism on the political situation here in the US as well. And of course, who can forget the repeated Mondays of news on the vaccine front. And again, today we had more news coming out from Moderna. I want to bring in Katie Nixon with Northern Trust Wealth Management just to get a little bit of perspective here on all of this as we wrap up this month right now. We're heading into December. It's usually, seasonally, it can be a strong time. You know, just not that long ago, we were saying that we needed stimulus to see anything like this, right? That was the story early in the fall. Stimulus, stimulus, stimulus. Now what happens? Do we need something out of Congress by the end of the year? We're starting to hear some news reports this afternoon that McConnell wants to maybe get something through the end of the year. To continue this rally, do we need Washington? KATIE NIXON: Right, so I think this is an important time to distinguish between the market and the economy. I think right now, it's very clear that the market is sort of looking past what is going to be a difficult couple of months, regardless of fiscal stimulus. We're going to have probably more rolling lockdown lights here in the US to try to continue to control the coronavirus. But the market's really firmly focused on 2021, I think. The good news on the vaccine front that you've covered I think is giving investors a lot of optimism. Now would fiscal stimulus be an additional support for the market? Of course. And we do expect there to be a smaller, targeted, more tactical package probably passed either during the lame duck or soon, after the inauguration. But I don't think it's necessary at this point that we get a fiscal package in order to maintain the market rally. ADAM SHAPIRO: Vance, gotta give you credit. Back in February, you went 60% into cash. Now you are 100% in equities. Is that a little dangerous perhaps? VANCE HOWARD: Well, that's what we do for a living. You know, Katie made a good point. There's a difference between the economy and the stock market. Those are two different animals doing two different things. Clearly, that's become the norm history wise. But again, the byline gave us a sell in February. We moved 60% to cash. It gave us a solid buy the first week of April. We were 100% back in the market in the second week of April, which, you know, the byline's mechanical. It's not emotional. It's repeatable. We take the emotion out of the equation because I don't know what the stock market's going to do tomorrow. And I don't know what the economy's going to do tomorrow. So I could take that out of the equation and trade math. And that's been a great trade force. Clearly, any pullback we've had since April, we've been buying into. And into what Katie said, you know, there's a big difference between the economy, which the economy is not doing well. With the stock market, if you're playing different sectors like a large cap growth, you're having a great year. JEN ROGERS: Jared Blikre, back to you. Energy, last time, when we had talked on the three, wasn't down this much, ending the day off more than 5%, 5.4% here. The month, though, a different story. Give us some of the wrap-up on the month. JARED BLIKRE: Sure thing. Let's go straight to the YFi Interactive. This is our sector heat map. And you can see on the bottom right, we've got energy down 5 and 1\/2% today. And the leader today tech and healthcare. But you look at what's happened over the month. Energy is still the clear standout. Now it's up 28% in the upper left there, followed by financials, industrials and materials, and then tech. Tech still outperforming here, the S&P 500. It just gives you a sense that we have really outperformed, and we have this broad-based leadership, which is necessary to build a long-term secular bull market. It doesn't mean it has to happen overnight. And anything can happen in the coming weeks and days. But the groundwork is being laid here. So let's take a look at some of our canaries, some of our sentiment market leaders. And you see in the forefront here, MJ. That's the cannabis ETF, up 47%, nearly 50% for the month. And then the IPO market has been extremely hot. The Renaissance IPO ETF, IPO ticker, up 25% month to date. And then you have solar. That's the TAN ETF. Bets-- that's betting-- that's a gambling ETF. XRT is retail. Then you have SOX. That's a chip index. And that has been making record highs, along with XRT. So you have this broad-based real-- excuse me. You have this broad-based rally here. You throw in regional banks and the transports. A lot of these markets are making record highs, and it just bodes as to the-- or says that the market is strong right now. And just give you a couple more spaces here. Look at the cannabis space. Incredible gains for the month. You look at Aurora Cannabis, that's up 188%. And also the work from home trade not to be sneezed at. Even though we lost some of its shine this month, we still see Slack technology is up 67%, a lot of that having to do with the expected Salesforce buyout out of it. Guys. ADAM SHAPIRO: Katie, what should investors make of two very important things you point out? First that with these markets, it could be too much too fast because that's rarely a good thing. And the other, we keep talking about fiscal stimulus, but it could be too little too late. What should we investors make of all that? KATIE NIXON: Right, so on the fiscal side, with the vaccine coming, the fiscal stimulus becomes a bit less important to investors. However, there is a risk as we see some of the market, some of the economic indicators, rather, soften, whether it's on the manufacturing side or certainly on the employment front, that we don't get a fiscal bridge that's strong enough or long enough to sustain the economy through the next couple of months. So that certainly is a risk. And on the other front, you know, optimism is a great thing. There's a lot of optimism and a lot of bullishness in the market right now. As you referenced, having a broader market participation is certainly a very healthy sign. But there is a danger that we get overly optimistic at this period of time. And we're certainly seeing retail investor surveys like the AAII survey, other options-based data, show us that investors are pretty bullish now, which doesn't really mean anything in isolation, but it does present a little fragility to the market in terms of being able to withstand any bad news. JEN ROGERS: Vance, I'm just curious on Katy's point there, just about optimism. And usually, if I asked this question, somebody will say, oh, Jen, you can't time the market. But that's what you do. You move to cash, and you did well. So what signs are you looking for that would make you make a move like that again? What are the signals that you're looking at? VANCE HOWARD: Right, like I said, the HCM byline is, it's the backbone of our whole company. We've been trading it for 25 years now. It served us well. We sidestepped 2000, 2002. We sidestepped 2008. But you got to trade what's actually happening. And the market's going up. I mean, that's just what's happening. I don't know what the market's going to do next week or next year. All I've got is a guess, like anybody else. But what I do has a quantitative measures. And our quantitative measures are clearly pointing this market's going higher. The bulls have control. You know, the Dow Jones just hit an all-time record high last week, which is what we call a Christopher Columbus Day. It means that that's territory that's never ever been seen before. New highs are telling you something on major indexes that selling it, there's a lot of buying power out there. We're sitting on a record amount of cash. We're sitting on 1, 5, 10-year treasuries that are barely paying any interest. There's a tremendous amount of fuel in the engine they can push this market higher. But again, the HCM byline is positive. As long as it's positive, we're 100% in. ADAM SHAPIRO: Just remember, Vance, Christopher Columbus almost got slaughtered by the people when he got to their world. We appreciate your being here, Katie Nixon, Northern Trust Wealth Management, as well as Vance Howard, CEO and PM at Howard Capital Management. All the best to you both."

    "url":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/canada-plans-digital-tax-2022-213517424.html",
    "article_text":"By David Ljunggren OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada plans to impose a tax on corporations providing digital services from 2022 that will stay in place until major nations come up with a coordinated approach on taxation, the Finance Department said on Monday. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development is working on a common approach to ensure digital behemoths, such as Alphabet Inc's Google and Facebook Inc, pay their share of taxes as the coronavirus hammers budgets. Canada said it was concerned about a delay in reaching agreement. The threat of digital services taxes has prompted threats of trade retaliation from outgoing U.S. President Donald Trump's administration. The new tax would come into effect on Jan. 1, 2022, and remain in place until a common approach is agreed upon. The measure would raise federal revenues by C$3.4 billion ($2.6 billion) over five years, starting in the 2021-22 fiscal year. \"Canadians want a tax system that is fair, where everyone pays their fair share,\" Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland told legislators in the fall economic update. \"Canada will act unilaterally, if necessary, to apply a tax on large multinational digital corporations, so they pay their fair share just like any other company operating in Canada.\" More details are due in next year's budget. Foreign-based vendors with no physical presence in Canada will also have to start collecting sales taxes on products such as mobile apps, online video gaming and streaming. The measure should raise C$1.2 billion over five years. Ottawa also plans to oblige people renting out short-term accommodation to charge sales taxes, saying popular digital rental platforms do not currently have to impose the taxes. That puts hotels at a disadvantage, it added. The government is also clamping down on the award of stock options to prevent \"high-income individuals employed at large, long-established, mature firms\" from taking unfair advantage. From now on, a C$200,000 annual limit will apply to stock option grants for those people. Ottawa did not provide a definition of high-income individuals or mature firms. The rules will not apply to startups or emerging companies, which often cannot afford to pay competitive salaries and instead offer stock options. The new rules will generate about C$200 million in federal revenues, the Finance Department said. (Reporting by David Ljunggren; Editing by Peter Cooney)"

    "article_text":"Scott Galloway, NYU Professor of Marketing and Author of 'Post Corona: From Crisis to Opportunity', joined Yahoo Finance Live to discuss his new book and his thoughts on big tech regulation. JEN ROGERS: I don't know if you heard me earlier, but I was saying you really threw a wrench in my day by having me read this book early. It's, uh-- it's, uh-- I guess I was going to say it's easy, but that makes it sound simple, but it's kind of like a page turner and it's what we talk about all the time. SCOTT GALLOWAY: Oh, thanks. JEN ROGERS: \"From Crisis to Opportunity\" though, what I get-- like, sometimes I'm reading it and I think this is OK, like it's going to turn out all right. We have the potential here to actually be better than we were before as a country, as a human race. And then I think, but wait, are we actually going to be able to take advantage of this opportunity? Are you optimistic given-- let's just talk about America-- how divided we are, income inequality, that we will be able to seize this opportunity for change here? SCOTT GALLOWAY: I think that's the correct question. And look, I've got to be honest, I'm a glass half empty kind of guy. And I would argue that we probably would have been better off the last 6 or 12 months listening more to the pessimists and less to the optimists. So I think our optimism as a nation and our view of exceptionalism has unfortunately morphed into an arrogance that's been a comorbidity. We've had more time to prepare for this. We spend more money on health care. We think of ourselves as being innovative. And we sit here today with record hospitalizations, and 5% of the world's population, and 25% of the infections and deaths. The Chinese word for crisis is risk and also juncture. It tries to combine those two meanings. And I do believe there are huge silver linings coming out of this pandemic, but it's not a default setting. America isn't-- you know, isn't what it is. It's what we make of it. And I would argue that we will look back on this moment either as having been, you know, what Vonnegut said that one step in the wrong direction, a step back, is a right step or this could be the signal or the juncture where we really turned down. I think it's up to us. There are some huge silver linings, but a default position that without sacrifice, without leadership that everything is going to turn out right so far I would argue the trajectory here is a negative one. ADAM SHAPIRO: You actually talk about several different issues. And I was, before we introduced you, talking about one of the things-- kind of the self-fulfilling prophecy when we talk about the weak get stronger. I think this is a portion of the book-- or rather the strong get stronger and the weak get weaker. Big tech got stronger and we use Tesla as the example. We keep talking about how wonderful Tesla is. That reinforces the belief that Tesla is wonderful. People buy the stock. Their borrowing costs are lower, and they can keep going forward. Are we setting ourselves up for a big fall? SCOTT GALLOWAY: Well, there's just examples everywhere. It took Apple 42 years to get to a trillion dollars and it took them five months to get to $2 trillion. Tesla's standing here in March was the fourth most valuable automobile company. Now, they're the most valuable and worth more than two, three, and four-- Daimler, Toyota, and Volkswagen-- combined. And we don't like to say this out loud, but I feel as if this pandemic has largely been invented when we're taking the top 10% into the top 1% and taking the rest of the 90% downward. There was a study by the Robin Hood Foundation that came out today that said 32% of people in New York have been forced to go to a food bank because of food insecurity since the beginning of the pandemic. So think about this, Adam. You're just as likely in New York State right now-- what we think of as the capital or, you know, the state that sort of embodies America-- you're just as likely to run into someone on the street who's had to go to a food bank than someone who has a college degree. So while, you know, we have flipped the script, if you will, capitalism is meant to be full-body contact violence and competition to unleash incredible prosperity such that we can be more empathetic and loving with our brothers and sisters across the nation. And it feels as if our collective efforts right now are to be more empathetic and loving with companies than with people. We've figured out a way to keep restaurants open. We've figured out a way to bail out small businesses and flatten the curve for rich people, but we haven't figured out a way to keep schools open. I mean, think about this. The two largest asset classes in America-- real estate and the stock market-- are at all-time highs. And by the way, 80% of those assets, by value, are owned by the top 10%. They're at all-time highs-- record prosperity, record savings rates. And at the same time, we have food insecurity. One in five households with kids have food insecurity. A third of Americans are worried they can't pay their rent. This is the best of times and the worst of times. We are barreling towards a nation with 3 million lords being served by 350 million serfs. We've decided to protect corporations, not people. Capitalism is literally collapsing on itself, unless it rebuilds that pillar of empathy supporting capitalism. JEN ROGERS: What responsibility do you think the four have-- Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google-- specifically as it goes to the issues you've been talking about and the inequality that we're seeing laid bare? Let's just take Amazon as an example. We just got through Black Friday. It's Cyber Monday. They are absolutely crushing it on sales. They've hired hundreds of thousands-- more than 400,000 people since the pandemic began. Most of those people though are warehouse workers making $15 an hour. What responsibility do those companies at the very top of the food chain you think have for not just where we've been, but really where we're going to affect change? SCOTT GALLOWAY: Yeah, so that's a meaningful question. So it struck me today-- and I don't think the two are correlated. I just meant to-- I want to use this to give your viewers and listeners a sense of proportion. In World War II, we were losing a third of the people that we are losing right now. And if you look at how many people Amazon is hiring every day, they're hiring about 1,400 people a day. That's about how many people each day are dying in America. And I just thought that was just sort of ironic when we talk about this K-shaped recovery. Now to your question on the responsibility these companies have, we'd like to think that these people have a code, and that they bring that code to work, and that they recognize the incredible blessings that America brings them, and that they want to prevent a tragedy of the commons. They want to pay their people well. I applaud Amazon for raising their minimum wage to $15 an hour. There's a lot to like about Amazon in my view in terms of what they've done with their employment base. They also have gamified municipalities such that we can transfer wealth from municipal fire, police, and school districts to the shareholders of Amazon through this ridiculous HQ2. They have also put small businesses out of business and prematurely euthanized big businesses by owning the rails, and anti-competitive behavior, and dumping products at prices through their access to cheap capital no other company can compete with. However-- however, I don't think it's smart-- I don't think it's a good strategy to wait on the better angels of billionaires. We can't wait on the generosity, and code, and personal conduct, and character of CEOs. To a certain extent, they're doing their job. It's we, as citizens, who are not doing ours. Specifically, we're not electing public officials that apply the same scrutiny around anti-trust, around anti-competitive behavior, around externalities when teens are getting depressed. We don't seem to want to hold these companies accountable or to the same standards we've held companies in the past. So if there's a culprit here, it's voters who aren't electing leaders that hold these companies to the same standards. If we're just going to wait for the better angels of Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg to show up, that is a bad strategy. ADAM SHAPIRO: Scott, I'm curious when you talk about capitalism on the way up, socialism on the way down, when you talk it's the voters who are bringing this upon ourselves. It doesn't sound like that's going to change, so where are we headed? It sounds like we're going to be headed to the 3 million you talk about-- bread and circuses like the old Roman Empire-- to keep the 330 million at bay. SCOTT GALLOWAY: Well, I'm actually-- I do think there's reasons for optimism. I think the Biden-Harris or the shadow of the Biden-Harris administration has fomented or catalyzed more positive change at Facebook and Twitter than in the last 10 years. I don't think it's an accident that all of a sudden Facebook and Twitter have found the technology and the will to start labeling misinformation around COVID-19 as misinformation. We've seen more of it in the last eight weeks than we've seen in the last eight years, and it's because the analogy I would use is you're seniors in high school and you've thrown the mother of all rager parties. And you get a text message on Sunday morning that your parents are coming home early and you're trying to clean up the house. There is the mother of all cleaning up their houses going on right now. Janet Yellen's appointment is very encouraging-- a more I don't want to call it activist, but more appointees that seem to believe in bilateral, multilateral cooperation, who seem to believe the regulation plays an important role, that will likely fund the CDC to the extent it warrants. $700 billion to the military, $7 billion to CDC. We're losing people at three times the velocity of World War II. It just seems like our priorities are a bit messed up here. And we have big tech, which has basically in my view, overrun Washington. So I am hopeful. There's some real silver linings here, but it's up to us to embrace those, and demand more of our leaders, and demand accountability, and realize that these companies are not people. We should not be protecting them. They're not concerned with the condition of our soul. They're not going to take care of us when we get older. Without structural change at a regulatory level, without a national complexion of sacrifice-- patriotism used to mean sacrifice. Now, it means stimulus. We planted victory gardens. We reached into our pockets. We didn't have our hand out. The notion that we would find wearing a mask to Walmart somehow tyrannical-- my mother in 1941 Britain slept in a makeshift bomb shelter and they passed out gas masks in the shape of Disney characters so the kids would put them on. And the idea that someone would say that this imposed on their individual freedom is just unthinkable. So we have a lot of soul searching to do here, but there's nothing wrong with America that can't be fixed with what's right with America. And I'm hopeful that a lot of those changes start in January. ADAM SHAPIRO: Scott, I've got to start wrapping up with you, but when you talk about your mother, I was thinking of my grandmother Hazel who drove a truck volunteer during World War II in Portland, Maine and the people of Portland are still terrified and stay off the roads. But I have to ask you, as I write up this discussion, we invite you into the program because you're someone people do listen to. What's the key message then because looking at the book, many of the things you say sound very pessimistic, and yet you say there's reason for hope. So that's my headline? What's the key message? SCOTT GALLOWAY: Capitalism fails unless it rests on a foundation of empathy and love. We have full-body contact violence at the corporate level. We let businesses go out of business. We let people get fired such that Apple can emerge and put Sun Microsystems out of business, and then we take that incredible prosperity and we're more empathetic with people. We fund social security so we can take 38% of seniors who are in poverty down to 11%. We fund Head Start. We have flipped the script and we've decided that capitalism means being loving and empathetic to corporations and Darwinistic and harsh towards individuals. Unless we flip it back and start deciding that capitalism is in the agency of others, and start letting corporations go out of business, and being harsh on corporations, and being more empathetic and generous with our citizens, capitalism-- the greatest system of its kind, the greatest upward lubricant of the middle class in history-- will collapse on itself. America isn't what it is. America is what we make of it. It is up to us, but it is time to go back to a system of America where capitalism rests on a pool of empathy. JEN ROGERS: Scott Galloway talking about industries may be going under. We didn't even get to talk about higher education, which you're in, so we'll have to dive into that another time. It's a great read. The book is \"Post Corona-- From Crisis to Opportunity.\" Scott Galloway, thanks so much for joining us. SCOTT GALLOWAY: Thank you."

It also continues to exhibit strong balance sheet and cash flow generation capacity Cost Minimizing Efforts to Boost Halliburton (HAL) The Zacks analyst believes that cost reducing efforts will boost Halliburton's bottom-line but is concerned about severe slowdown in North American drilling.

Expansion Actions, NSCC Carbon Buyout to Aid Cabot (CBT) Per the Zacks analyst, Cabot will gain from its actions to expand its specialty compounds business. The NSCC Carbon plant acquisition will also support growth of its specialty carbons business. Falling Occupancy, High Disposals to Hurt Mack-Cali (CLI) Per the Zacks analyst, Mack-Cali's suburban office asset sales will have a dilutive impact on its near-term results. Also, declining occupancy at the multifamily portfolio is worrisome. Lack of Collaboration Contracts Is a Woe for Novavax (NVAX) Per the Zacks analyst, Novavax's portfolio is devoid of collaboration contracts for product development, which is a concern. Stiff competition in the target market also remains a headwind. Weak Marketing Services & Rising Competition Ail eBay (EBAY) Per the Zacks analyst, eBay is hurt by sluggishness in its marketing services. Further, intensifying competition from Amazon, Alibaba and other players remains a risk."

    "url":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/vietnam-steps-online-crackdown-jailed-170100499.html",
    "article_text":"(Corrects term used in paragraph one to \"jailed activists\", not \"political prisoners\", in line with definition used in report) HANOI, Dec 1 (Reuters) - The number of jailed activists in Vietnam has reached its highest on record, according to a tally by Amnesty International, which in a report on Tuesday accused Facebook and Google of censorship in the Southeast Asian country. There are at least 170 \"prisoners of conscience\" in Vietnam, the report said, of which around 70 are currently serving jail terms for online activism, mainly on Facebook and Google's YouTube. \"Once the great hope for the expansion of freedom of expression in the country, social media platforms are fast becoming human rights\u2013free zones, where any peaceful dissent or criticism of the Vietnamese government is liable to be censored,\" the report said. The current number of prisoners of conscience in Vietnam is the highest that London-based Amnesty has reported since it began publishing the figures in 1996, an Amnesty spokesman told Reuters. Amnesty defines prisoners of conscience as people who have not used or advocated violence, but were imprisoned because of their identity or beliefs. Vietnam's foreign ministry, which handles enquires from foreign media, did not respond to a request for comment. Despite sweeping economic reform and openness to social change, Vietnam's ruling Communist Party retains tight control on media, tolerates little opposition and has intensified a crackdown on dissidents and online activists ahead of a key Party meeting next year. Last month, Reuters reported that Vietnam had threatened to shut down Facebook locally if it did not agree to censor more political content. Vietnam's government said at the time that Facebook should abide by local laws. Amnesty's report said the U.S. social media giants do not do enough to resist government pressure to censor posts. It cited interviews with Vietnamese activists who said their posts had been censored. Both Facebook and Google have said that they only restrict access to content if it violates local laws. One such law, Article 117, prohibits Vietnamese citizens from \"making, storing or spreading\" anti-state materials. (Reporting by James Pearson; Editing by Martin Petty)"

    "article_text":"But shortly afterward, Zoom announced it would temporarily remove its time limit for free users on Nov. 26 and Nov. 27. Does Microsoft's challenge spell trouble for Zoom, or is it too late for the tech giant to catch up? Image source: Microsoft. In October, Microsoft revealed that Teams had 115 million daily active users (DAUs), up over 50% from 75 million just six months earlier. Slack only had about 12 million DAUs last September, and it hasn't updated that figure since. That's why Microsoft is now setting its sights on Zoom. Zoom became a household name because it was free, easy to use, and hosted more users than traditional video conferencing services. But it also struggled with privacy and security problems as hundreds of millions of new users joined its platform. Therefore, it wasn't surprising to see Microsoft remove Teams' time limit. It's also allowing users who don't have Microsoft accounts or the Teams app to freely join meetings through a web browser -- which mirrors Zoom's streamlined browser-based meetings. Zoom's number of daily active meeting participants rose from 10 million at the end of 2019 to over 300 million in April. But that doesn't mean Zoom has 300 million DAUs since each individual user can be counted as multiple participants if they join more than one Zoom meeting per day. Microsoft also stated it had 200 million daily active participants in a single day back in April. Image source: Zoom. Zoom and Teams still can't be considered direct competitors, since Zoom is built on video calls while Teams is a unified communications platform for enterprise users. Microsoft's brand also doesn't seem to be strongly associated with video calls anymore, as seen with the tepid market response to its other Zoom competitor, Skype Meet Now, earlier this year. That's why Microsoft is now leveraging the strength of Teams in the enterprise market to enter the consumer-facing market. It launched Teams for consumers earlier this year, which\u00a0targets friends and families instead of co-workers, and removing time limits and login barriers might convince more people to try out the service. Unfortunately, I think it will still be tough for Microsoft to pivot Teams from the enterprise to mainstream users. Microsoft expanded Teams in the enterprise market with aggressive bundling strategies, but it lacks that advantage in the consumer market, where Zoom enjoys a first-mover's advantage. Teams will also stiff face competition from free alternatives like Facebook's Messenger Rooms and its own neglected Skype platform -- which still attracted 40 million DAUs back in\u00a0March. In other words, offering free all-day calls probably won't stop most people from using Zoom as a verb for video calls in general."

Industrials were also in the red as airlines fell sharply following a weaker outlook from JetBlue. JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ:JBLU) fell 3% after guiding fourth-quarter revenue to drop 70% year-over-year, compared with the prior guidance of a 65% decrease. The company said booking trends remain volatile and expected revenue recovery will be nonlinear through the fourth quarter and beyond.

Would Amazon subsidiary Whole Foods only be permitted to sell 365 Everyday Value products in its physical locations but not on the Prime website? The House majority report excoriated Facebook for competing aggressively, and then acquiring competitors like Instagram and WhatsApp and structuring those to not directly compete with its eponymous service.

    "article_text":"\nWe are playing fast and loose with the Dow milestones above. Reporting the milestone closes obscures the fact that the Dow went back \u2013 sometimes way back \u2013 below those close figures at times before clearing the next milestone. Arguably, the most important figures are the times to doubling, but even these are fleeting moments that mostly cluster around bull markets.\n \nThe fact is that the Dow is a large number and has been since the '80s. The Dow moving from 100 to 1,000, for example, is a larger magnitude of a move (10 times) than from 10,000 to 20,000 (two times). Looking at tenfold increases as opposed to doubling shows that the Dow took 66 years to go from 100 to 1,000, and just 27 years to go from 1,000 to 10,000 (1999). This definitely shows an acceleration, but it is somewhat unlikely that we will see another tenfold increase in that compressed timeline, as it took two incredible bull markets in the '80s and '90s to make it happen.\n \nWhat the Dow does have going for it now is the inertia of large numbers. A jump of 1,000 points is not nearly as much of a challenge for the Dow as it was in the 1896 through 1990 period because 1,000 points represents a smaller percentage increase as the Dow continues to grow. That said, this recent run-up in the Dow is still incredible given the challenging economic times it powered through.\n \nHowever, like previous Dow milestones, the index can and likely will slide back and forth across 30,000 a number of times. Remember, the Dow was down below 20,000 as recently as this past March. So the milestone is fun to report and makes for a good headline, but it isn't going to change your investment outlook any more than the Dow closing at 29,921 at the end of last week did.\n \nStocks \nIndex Trading Strategy & Education \nEconomics \nUS Markets \nTrading \nGovernment & Policy"

    "article_text":"While \"recovery\" stocks have been making big moves upwards in November, 2020 has been a year when technology stocks have pulled away from the pack. Yet just because tech stocks have soared this year doesn't mean better things couldn't be in store in 2021. Here are three top tech names that have each beaten the broader market this year, yet which also have 2021 catalysts that could push them to even greater heights.\u00a0 Image source: Getty Images. Speaking of VMware, back in July, Dell stated its intention to spin off the rest of its 80.4% stake in VMware later in 2021.  Based on VMware's valuation of its publicly traded shares, Dell's VMware stake alone would be worth about $48 billion.  Currently, all of Dell is trading for about $52 billion, meaning the market is valuing the rest of Dell at just $4 billion.  Considering that the non-VMware portion of Dell has made $4.9 billion in operating income in the first nine months of 2020 alone, that seems quite pessimistic.  Of note, the spinoff would not become tax-free until September 2021. Still, Dell has been gaining in value relative to VMware as we get closer to that date, and that trend should continue next year. Alphabet doesn't have one specific catalyst like Dell, but rather a few different ones that could come to fruition in 2021. First, Alphabet's search revenue actually fell in the second quarter amid the pandemic for the first time ever, yet it recovered strongly in the third quarter. As the travel and leisure sectors recover after a vaccine is distributed, look for Alphabet's core search ad revenue to grow even more as the economy gets back to full strength. Currently, Prosus trades at a substantial discount to the value of its Tencent ownership alone, despite also owning about $30 billion worth of other international internet businesses in food delivery, online classifieds, digital payments, and education tech.  It's not clear that Naspers intends to cash in more of its Tencent stake when the three years is up. Yet given that Prosus trades at roughly a 30% discount and Naspers trades at a 50% discount to Tencent, management may choose to cash in more of its massive Tencent stake and engage in more financial engineering.  Even if that doesn't happen, however, Naspers\/Prosus management has promised more actions to close the yawning discount going forward. CEO Bob Van Dijk said on the recent conference call, \"what I want everyone to take back from this is we're working as hard on [closing the discount] as we are on the business. It's important to us. It's important for our shareholders and we want to make progress. And when we're ready, we'll come back and say that's where this is.\"  Naspers spun off Prosus in late 2019 and announced its buyback in 2020. Shareholders could look forward to at least one and perhaps more financial engineering actions next year, which will hopefully further close the discount to its prized asset."

    "article_text":"It makes sense that Apple is a popular stock on Robinhood. However, anyone who thinks Apple stock is a safe bet that can't go wrong could be in for a big surprise. Here are three reasons why Apple may not be the best stock to own. Image source: Getty Images. The smartphone market in developed countries is largely saturated. There just aren't many potential new customers who don't yet use a smartphone. This means that Apple's iPhone business in these countries is largely just selling existing iPhone users on new versions. That's all well and good, but it's not going to be a major growth driver for Apple. Apple's iPhone business is dependent on the company convincing users that its latest devices are the next big thing. That gets harder as smartphones get better. Five years ago, the year-to-year leap in smartphone quality was significant. Today, not so much. Yes, Apple can grow its iPhone user base in countries like India where it doesn't dominate the market. But those markets are brutally competitive. Apple currently has a single-digit market share in that country, and inexpensive iPhone alternatives from Chinese manufacturers will make it tough for the situation to change. The iPhone business will ebb and flow, with some year's models proving more popular than others. But it isn't going to be a meaningful source of growth for Apple. Apple has been making a big push into services in recent years, selling its user base on subscriptions for music, video streaming, games, and cloud storage. The company even recently announced an all-in-one subscription that bundles many of its services together. Services have become big business for Apple. In fiscal 2020, Apple generated nearly $54 billion from its services segment. Services are now the second largest source of revenue for Apple, topped only by the iPhone. While the services growth story sounds great, there are a couple problems. For one, Apple generates a huge chunk of its services revenue from a deal with Alphabet's Google that makes Google the default search engine on iOS. This deal, which involves Google paying Apple between $8 billion and $12 billion annually, is being targeted in an antitrust lawsuit against Google. These payments are essentially all profit for Apple, so losing them would take a big bite out of the bottom line. A separate antitrust lawsuit against Apple in the U.S. could be coming as well, focused on the company's policies and fees related to the App Store and payments. If Apple is forced to reduce how much it charges developers or loosen its grip on app distribution or payments, the services segment will suffer. The services growth story for Apple could hit a brick wall if things don't go the company's way on the antitrust front, and earnings could plunge under the worst-case scenario. Despite a largely stagnant iPhone business and a services business that's under attack by antitrust regulators, Apple stock is priced for growth. Apple currently trades for around 36 times earnings; that's down from closer to 40 times earnings a couple months ago, but it's higher than at any other point since the financial crisis. Apple's net income dropped 7.4% in its fiscal fourth quarter, dragged down by a slumping iPhone business. Net income was up just 3.9% in fiscal 2020, despite strong demand for Mac computers, iPads, and other non-iPhone gadgets amid the pandemic. Those aren't the kinds of growth rates that scream \"36 times earnings.\" Apple is already worth around $2 trillion. The pricey stock has provided exceptional returns for shareholders up to this point, but the company may be too big and facing too many risks to do anything but disappoint investors from here on out."

    "article_text":"Stepping into a hot stock at exactly the right time is plenty of fun. The fact is, however, that stock picking should be a relatively boring affair for most of us most of the time. Investors are generally best served by finding quality names and then letting time do the hard work. That's not to suggest investors should limit themselves to just growth or just value. Likewise, a winning portfolio typically consists of dividend stocks as well as stocks of companies that pour every bit of their profits back into their own growth. Above all else, quality is the key. To this end, here's a look four quality names that investors aiming to build a retirement nest egg should consider. They're all quite different from one another, but in all four cases, these stocks could be considered best-of-breed picks within their respective industries. Image source: Getty Images. And Edison International truly is an international play. While U.S. consumers most likely know the company through its Southern California Edison, its Edison Energy arm does business through partnerships in Europe, South America, and Australia as well. This mix has helped smooth out any earnings volatility the company may have otherwise suffered. Prologis isn't just a dividend payer presently yielding 2.3% with no growth prospects, though. While the contagion has slowed its ability to do so, the real estate investment trust is always on the hunt for new properties to purchase and then rent out. What this company lacks in payout potential, though, it more than makes up for in marketability of its products. It's still the premier name in office productivity software, with cloud-based offerings like Office 365 driving a 21% year-over-year increase in revenue during the quarter that ended in September. Skeptics will argue that nothing lasts forever, adding that Alphabet's Google may be nearing its maximum reach. That stance assumes Alphabet won't find new ways to connect with the world's web users, and ignores the company's existing position within the search engine space. StatCounter's Global Stats indicate that Google still fields nearly 93% of the globe's web searches, while its Android operating system is found on 73% of the world's mobile devices. Those numbers have remained relatively steady, too, despite stepped-up competition on both fronts."

    "article_text":"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Having watched warily from the wings, McDonald\u2019s Corp. is finally entering the modern meatless-market with a menu of herbivorous items. Top of the list is the plant-based burger, McPlant: \u201cThere are other plant-based burgers out there, but the McPlant delivers our iconic taste in a sink-your-teeth-in (and wipe-your-mouth) kind of sandwich. It\u2019s made with a juicy, plant-based patty and served on a warm, sesame seed bun with all the classic toppings.\u201d Although McPlant is a notable pivot for a company that grinds through a billion pounds of American beef each year, McDonald\u2019s is being a soup\u00e7on coy: The \u201cother plant-based burgers\u201d to which they allude include Burger King\u2019s Impossible Whopper, Wendy\u2019s The Plantiful, White Castle\u2019s Impossible Sliders, and Carl\u2019s Jr. Beyond Burger \u2014 as well as groundbreaking consumer products from Impossible Foods, Beyond Meat, and Kellogg\u2019s Incogmeato. Because 89% of meatless-burger consumers are neither vegetarian nor vegan, and because the plant-based meat market may soon be worth $35.4 billion, faux-meat firms seem less keen on promoting plants than blurring the plant\/meat divide. This explains their use of beet powder, annatto and heme to simulate the ooze of blood, and the carnivorous tone of their branding. It\u2019s surely no accident that McPlant retains its corporate prefix, that Beyond Meat and Incogmeato deploy a muscular suffix and that Impossible Foods toys with a knowing oxymoron. These modern plant-based brands are a world away from the earnest worthiness of meatless 1.0 \u2014 Quorn, Linda McCartney\u2019s, Turtle Island Foods \u2014 a trick they pull off with all the techniques of \u201cdazzle.\u201d * * * In 1917, in response to the increasing threat from German submarines, the British artist Norman Wilkinson pioneered a counterintuitive form of marine camouflage(1) that he called \u201cdazzle painting.\u201d Recognizing that, even before radar, massive ships could never be rendered invisible, Wilkinson proposed making them harder for U-boats to identify, size, track and target. \u201cSo-called invisibility against submarine attack [he wrote] is not only impossible, but dangerous, and consequently if a vessel can be seen at all, it does not matter how visible she is, providing her course remains a matter of question for the attacker.\u201d Wilkinson fostered enemy uncertainty by painting crazy monochrome zigzags and stripes across every inch of hull, deck and funnel until some 4,000 British and American vessels resembled bizarre aquatic zebras. The tactical twist of Wilkinson\u2019s dazzle was to ensure that what cannot be concealed should confuse: \u201cThe primary object of this scheme was not so much to cause the enemy to miss his shot when actually in firing position \u2026 but to mislead him, when the ship was first sighted, as to the correct position to take up.\u201d Naturally, such ingenious misdirection is readily applicable to branding. * * * Some of the most conspicuous \u201cdazzle\u201d proliferates with \u201chedonic\u201d brands \u2014 those where pleasure-seeking consumers must be persuaded that \u201cbad\u201d is \u201cgood\u201d: That \u201cgood\u201d is \u201cbad\u201d: Or that \u201cbad\u201d is \u201cbad\u201d \u2014 but, hey, what the hell: Modern meatless burgers operate in the intersection of all three dazzles: They are simultaneously meaty (\u201cbad\u201d but delicious), vegetarian (\u201cgood\u201d but boring) and a fast-food treat (\u201cnaughty but nice\u201d)(2). This dazzling triad also distracts from the complex question of whether meatless burgers are as good for one\u2019s wallet, health or the environment as might be hoped. Inevitably, hedonistic dazzle is used by a range of adult brands, not least Las Vegas\u2019s hugely successful \u201cWhat happens here, stays here\u201d campaign \u2014 which slyly encouraged the sins of Sin City, even as it elided the wages of sin. * * * Many brands, most notably in the auto sector, hide behind bait-and-switch safety disclaimers that dangle the rush of danger while evading its results. Given that 1.35 million people died on the roads in 2018 (including 36,835 Americans), the deployment of \u201cdazzle tags\u201d like \u201cProfessional driver on a closed course\u201d and \u201cDemonstration only, do not attempt\u201d seems more akin to using Freddy Krueger to sell kitchen knives than offering a satisfactory deterrent to vehicular mayhem. Indeed, it\u2019s probably no coincidence that health-related \u201cdazzle tags\u201d often achieve the opposite of their purported aim. In 2017, research by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration concluded that snack foods labelled as \u201cvitamin-fortified\u201d confused consumers into making \u201cpoor dietary decisions.\u201d And in 2014, research from Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health indicated that alcohol \u201cresponsibility messages\u201d (\u201cdrink responsibly,\u201d \u201cenjoy in moderation\u201d) were \u201coverwhelmingly used to promote products rather than convey relevant public health information.\u201d One of the oddest \u201cdanger dazzles\u201d was that attempted by Death Cigarettes, a short-lived \u201990s venture that trumped the \u201cdistraction dazzle\u201d of Big Tobacco (cool camels, rugged cowboys, cut silk) with tombstone packs adorned with a skull and crossbones. While traditional cigarette brands attempt to subvert popular culture, Death Cigarettes set up shop where the unstoppable force of addiction meets the immovable object of death. This is not hiding in plain sight, so much as hiding in the spotlight \u2014 and as Rochefoucauld said, \u201cneither the sun nor death can be looked at steadily.\u201d(3) The impact of such blatant dazzle is similar to the optical effect of Anish Kapoor\u2019s deeply pigmented \u201cVoid\u201d sculptures, which draw in one\u2019s gaze while defocusing one\u2019s vision. Kapoor defined the illusion thus: \u201cYou can see it with your eyes. Then you can\u2019t see it. Yet you know it. You know it with your body. Your imagination senses it.\u201d * * * Just as dazzle painting helped warships to conceal their size, so dazzle branding helps underdogs bark above their bite. There are numerous examples of such shape-shifting strategies, including Volkswagen\u2019s 1959 \u201cThink small\u201d slogan, which neatly mocked the muscle car, and Apple\u2019s 1997 \u201cThink different\u201d campaign, which strove to mainstream the marginalized: \u201cHere\u2019s to the crazy ones, the misfits, the rebels, the troublemakers, the round pegs in the square holes \u2026 the ones who see things differently \u2014 they\u2019re not fond of rules, and they have no respect for the status quo.\u201d Such campaigns echo the actions of those animals that change their size and shape in order to deter predators and attract mates \u2014 two goals shared by brands of every dimension. One of advertising\u2019s longest underdog dazzles was that deployed by Avis between 1962 and 2012. Unable to conceal its ranking, Avis sought instead to confuse the idea that \u201cbiggest is best\u201d: Significantly, Avis was not defending its second place status but attacking the market leader for being number one and, by extension, for complacence and slapdashery. So effective was this insurgency that the alpha-brand Hertz felt compelled to respond \u2014 the advertising equivalent of forcing a U-boat to surface. An elegant variation on the underdog dazzle was successfully launched in 2000 by the British Teacher Training Agency. Facing the challenge of luring high-caliber candidates into classrooms, they confronted the sneering clich\u00e9 \u201cThose who can, do; those who can\u2019t, teach\u201d with a splendidly contrarian campaign, \u201cThose who can, teach.\u201d One of Britain\u2019s best-loved adverts arose from a similar desire to upend accepted wisdom. In 1983, unable to conceal that its telephone directory was used primarily for \u201cthe nasty things in life, like a blocked drain,\u201d Yellow Pages ran an advert that was deeply human, sentimental and above all nice. Brands that strongly divide consumer sentiment occasionally use dazzle to negate opprobrium or laugh it off. Marmite\u2019s response to 33% of Brits loathing its yeast-extract spread was not to hug the haters but double down on the hate. In so doing it created the instantly viral campaign, \u201cMarmite: You either love it or hate it.\u201d Similarly, certain fans of the British football club Millwall revel in their unpopularity with the defiant chant \u201cNo one likes us we don\u2019t care\u201d (sung to the tune of Rod Stewart\u2019s \u201cSailing\u201d) which, over time, has evolved into a sub-brand of its own: * * * For obvious reasons, dazzle is a finely honed tool of political communication \u2014 as the BBC\u2019s Yes Minister elegantly satirized: Sir Humphrey: As long as we can head him off this Open Government nonsense. Bernard: But I thought we were calling the White Paper \u201cOpen Government\u201d? Sir Humphrey: Yes, well, always dispose of the difficult bit in the title. It does less harm there than in the text. Sir Arnold: It\u2019s the law of inverse relevance. The less you intend to do about something, the more you have to keep talking about it. This chimes with the Fox News slogan \u201cFair and Balanced,\u201d which was devised by Roger Ailes when he launched the network in 1996. As Gabriel Sherman wrote in 2017, when the slogan was retired: \u201cIn the annals of modern advertising, \u2018Fair & Balanced\u2019 will be considered a classic. The slogan was Ailes\u2019s cynical genius at its most successful. While liberals mocked the tagline, it allowed Ailes to give viewers the appearance of both sides being heard, when in fact he made sure producers staged segments so that the conservative viewpoint always won.\u201d Brands regularly turn to dazzle when they find themselves edging toward the wrong side of history. It is often claimed that Alfred Nobel established his eponymous prizes after reading his own damning obituary (\u201cThe merchant of death is dead\u201d) which was erroneously published after his brother\u2019s demise. Whether or not this legend is true, the legacy dazzle worked: How many more people associate the name Nobel with literature, science and peace than with the invention of dynamite? In 2004, Unilever hired Wolff Olins to transform its impersonal, industrial and Twin Towers-ish identity into something more sensitive, playful and environmentally beguiling: The result \u2014 with its casual script, dazzling sparkles and 24 cute icons \u2014 is more akin to a fossil agglomeration than the branding of a global behemoth that emits 100 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents each year. And this exculpatory effect was surely the point. Similarly, the \u201cgreen rush\u201d of airlines using carbon offsets to sell \u201cnet-zero carbon flights\u201d may be less ecological, than a tactical response to \u201cflygskam\u201d \u2014 the Swedish \u201cflight shaming\u201d trend that has taken wing. The dazzle of consumer carbon offsetting was deftly skewered by Camilla Cavendish: \u201cEasyJet, in pledging to offset the emissions from its flights for what will be less than \u00a31 a ticket, is effectively offering a \u2018get out of hell free\u2019 card. Passengers can tick the \u2018offset\u2019 box and continue on their merry way, unaware that the offer prices carbon dioxide well below its trading value. \u2026 Carbon offsetting is shaping up to be the greatest mis-selling scandal since the Dominican friar Johann Tetzel sold pardons to redeem the dead.\u201d In 2000, Landor helped British Petroleum transition from a \u201cpart of the problem\u201d \u201cbig oil\u201d giant to a \u201cpart of the solution\u201d \u201cleading energy company.\u201d It did so by dumping the company\u2019s 70-year-old shield for a \u201chelios\u201d sunburst, next to which the lower-case, superscript \u201cbp\u201d name is almost an afterthought. This (literally) dazzling redesign stumbled in 2010, when BP\u2019s drilling rig Deepwater Horizon exploded, killing 11 and disgorging 4 million barrels of oil into the Gulf of Mexico. It\u2019s likely nothing could have limited the damage to BP\u2019s brand after such a disaster, but the chasm between the environmental ostentation of BP\u2019s sunburst and the bleak reality of oil exploration added insult to injury, as evinced by the logo-redesign competition Greenpeace launched: (Greenpeace is itself arguably something of a dazzle brand. Although the organization espouses non-violence, given its advocacy of dramatic and sometimes damaging direct action, Greenpeace may be green but it is far from entirely pacific.) Of course, there are limits to what even dazzle can achieve. The story of Monsanto\u2019s brand can be told in three logos: * * * It\u2019s a pleasing coincidence that capitalism\u2019s ultimate dazzle brand dazzles literally as well as metaphorically \u2014 so much so that almost everything consumers know and feel about diamonds was concocted by De Beers and its roster of advertising talent. As Edward Jay Epstein detailed in his legendary 1982 essay and book: \u201cThe diamond invention \u2014 the creation of the idea that diamonds are rare and valuable, and are essential signs of esteem \u2014 is a relatively recent development in the history of the diamond trade.\u201d Although the disco-ball of diamond\u2019s dazzle is multifaceted, a few examples from Epstein and others will suffice: The \u201csalary rule\u201d that an engagement ring should cost one month\u2019s salary was devised in the 1930s to draw the middle-class into diamond ownership; in the 1980s the rate mysteriously rose to two month\u2019s salary, or three in Japan. The image of men surprising women with a diamond was insinuated into Hollywood movies both to associate diamonds with romantic love, and because men spend more on jewels when shopping alone. The \u201ceternity ring\u201d was devised not as a celebration of everlasting love, but to create a new market for a vast cache of miniature Russian diamonds. In addition to emphasizing the emotional resonance of diamonds, the slogan \u201cA diamond is forever\u201d helped discourage women from selling their jewels and thereby discovering that diamonds may not be the appreciating investment they believed. * * * In February, Burger King trumpeted the removal of artificial additives from its sandwiches with an advertisement that depicted a Whopper slowly rotting over 34 time-lapsed days: This unsettling film (more Peter Greenaway than Bobby Flay) proved as contentious as Burger King\u2019s global CMO Fernando Machado clearly intended: \u201cI don\u2019t have the media money to throw something at people that\u2019s not going to stand out or get noticed. In this case specifically, we were expecting some controversy and debate.\u201d Machado also alluded to the power of dazzle: \u201cThe essence of the idea is to show something that you know, in theory, is bad \u2014 mold \u2014 but it\u2019s shown in such a beautiful, stunning way and you\u2019re talking about it as a positive. \u2026 It almost messes with your mind. You know mold isn\u2019t good, but it looks so beautiful!\u201d Burger King\u2019s spot was unarguably a hit, but what actually \u201cmesses with your mind\u201d is the advert\u2019s slight of brand. While eliminating unnecessary additives is admirable, it\u2019s hardly the defining challenge of fast food compared, say, with its role in obesity, diabetes, addiction, academic performance, depression and social inequality. Like an arms dealer singing the praises of a gun\u2019s silencer, the \u201cmoldy\u201d Whopper\u2019s real success may be diverting our gaze from the uncomfortable nutritional truth that even an Impossible Whopper with unsalted medium fries delivers 1,010 calories, 50 grams of fat, 13 grams of saturated fat, 1,440 milligrams of sodium and 13 grams of sugar. Kander and Ebb were right: Give \u2019em the old razzle dazzleRazzle Dazzle \u2019emGive \u2019em an act with lots of flash in itAnd the reaction will be passionateGive \u2019em the old hocus pocusBead and feather \u2019emHow can they see with sequins in their eyes? (1) Although Wilkinson was decisive in the military application of dazzle, the idea of disruptive camouflage owes much to the work of the American artist Abbott Handerson Thayer and the Scottish zoologist John Graham Kerr \u2014 both of whom draw the origins of \u201cdazzle\u201d back to the animal kingdom. (2) \u201cNaughty but nice\u201d was a National Dairy Council campaign to promote fresh cream cakes (!) in the 1970s and \u201980s; the slogan was devised by none other than Salman Rushdie.

    "url":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/apple-suppliers-exodus-china-won-220000376.html",
    "article_text":"(Bloomberg) -- The splintering of the global tech supply chain that began during President Donald Trump\u2019s watch looks set to persist under his successor. Apple Inc., the largest of the many tech giants that rely on Chinese factories to make their gadgets, will move some production of its iPads and MacBooks to Vietnam. Key assembly partner Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., known also as Foxconn, has allocated $270 million in new investments to the Southeast Asian country. Those moves presage a larger and longer-term migration that may have ramifications for the iPhone maker as well as China\u2019s role as workshop to the world. Foxconn founder Terry Gou coined the term \u201cG2\u201d to describe the trend of a unified supply chain splitting into at least two. Company Chairman Young Liu said in August that the likes of India, Southeast Asia and the Americas could each in the future end up with a dedicated manufacturing ecosystem of their own. The trend now looks irreversible as other countries including India and Vietnam are boosting their infrastructure and efforts to lure manufacturers through lower costs and fewer geopolitical worries. \u201cAs China gets more expensive, and as U.S. politics have been unpredictable, companies have shifted production of some goods out of China. That trend will continue as China gets more expensive and as Vietnam and India improve their competitiveness,\u201d said Dan Wang, a technology analyst at Gavekal Dragonomics. Read more: Apple\u2019s Shifting Supply Chain Creates Boomtowns in Rural Vietnam Trump\u2019s trade hostilities against China caused many manufacturers to shift production capacity to neighboring countries like Vietnam and further afield to sites in Mexico and India, in order to avoid being slapped with punitive tariffs and to mitigate future sanctions risk. Apple, whose Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook orchestrated the creation of its current Chinese-centric production chain, has resisted a large-scale move but in recent years has increasingly explored alternatives. The Cupertino, California-based company is continuing to add iPhone capacity in India through its assembly partners, aided by Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s policy to attract top-tier smartphone companies to make their gadgets locally for export. Pegatron Corp., the last of the major iPhone assemblers to arrive in the country, announced earlier this month it is injecting 11 billion rupees ($150 million) into its Indian unit and will start production there as soon as late 2021. Back at home, the iPhone maker has been lobbying the U.S. government to support local chip production with tax breaks. Its key supplier Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. is planning a chip fab in Arizona, though the modest scale and technology of that facility would suggest it will service smaller customers, at least to begin with. Beyond Apple, Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google has placed orders with Foxconn to assemble key components for its servers in Wisconsin, at the under-utilized facility that has to date been most famous for what it hasn\u2019t produced. Mass production there is expected to go ahead in the first quarter. Pegatron officials said earlier this month that the company plans to also set up manufacturing operations in the U.S. to serve other customers. Wistron Corp., another Taiwanese contract manufacturer that handles iPhone orders as well as laptop and server production for other American customers, announced plans earlier this month to add capacity in Mexico and Taiwan. It\u2019s also buying a Western Digital Corp. factory in Malaysia. Chairman Simon Lin said in March that half of Wistron\u2019s capacity can be located outside of China as soon as 2021, with Vietnam operations ramping up and the company seeing India as a key strategic site for the next decade due to its market size and resources. Trump\u2019s tariffs on Chinese-made products have also forced other international companies to rethink their manufacturing operations. Nintendo Co. now has some of its Switch console production handled by Sharp Corp. in Malaysia, after it asked its main assembly partner Foxconn Technology Co. to offer geographic alternatives to its core China operations. Foxconn Tech, a major entity of the Foxconn Technology Group and a Sharp shareholder, made the connection between the two Japanese firms. Read more: Nintendo Adds Sharp as Assembler of Popular Switch Console While Apple is diversifying its global supply chain, it\u2019s also deepening its links with local Chinese manufacturers to serve the domestic market. Earlier this year, China\u2019s Luxshare Precision Industry Co. struck a deal to acquire Wistron\u2019s iPhone production facilities in the country, a move that will create the first mainland company to assemble Apple\u2019s marquee handsets. Compatriot BYD Electronic International Co. is also now splitting iPad orders with Foxconn and Compal Electronics Inc., a person familiar with the matter said. AirPods orders, meanwhile, are now dominated by Luxshare and another compatriot, GoerTek Inc. It took Foxconn 30 years to build up its massive Chinese operations and India or any other region is unlikely to catch up overnight, Foxconn\u2019s Liu said earlier this month. The supply chain shift will take time, \u201cand China will remain a major electronics manufacturing hub for at least the next five years,\u201d Gavekal\u2019s Wang added. \u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P."

    "article_text":"2U is in the midst of a massive transformation of its business. Four years ago, it was totally reliant on its graduate programs for revenue growth. This required the company to invest up to $10 million to develop each program with a partner university. As a quality program takes time to develop, it could be a year or more before 2U would see revenue from students. Once the completed online program is launched, it is branded under the university name, and tuition is set by the university as well.\u00a0 A few years ago, the company realized this operating model with heavy upfront investments wasn't sustainable long term. It has significantly reduced the number of high-end programs it was launching and reduced the investment for the ones it did create. Another key part of this transition was two acquisitions: Get Smarter (a short course online development company) and Trilogy (an IT boot camp provider). These investments are focused on shorter learning programs that are quicker to develop and provide a faster return. They also provide 2U's more than 75 university partners a means to expand into new educational non-degree tracks. These could be an attractive alternative for adults wishing to enhance their skills without the cost and time burden of a graduate degree. 2U Metrics Q3 2016 Q3 2017 Q3 2018 Q3 2019 Q3 2020 Total revenue $52.0 million $70.3 million $107.0 million $153.8 million $201.1 million Grad degree revenue $52.0 million $65.9 million $89.7 million $103.4 million $122.0 million Alternative credential revenue N\/A $4.4 million $17.3 million $50.4 million $79.1 million Alternative credential % of total N\/A 6.3% 16.2% 32.8% 39.3% Data source: Company earnings reports. Table by author. You can see in the table above that over the last four years, the top line has almost quadrupled, thanks to a combination of more university partners, more program offerings, and more students. In its most recent quarter, organic revenue growth accelerated to 31% year over year, up from 18% in the second quarter and 17% in the prior-year period. This strength was primarily attributed to its alternative credential segment which surged 57%. Key quarterly metrics Q3 2020 Q3 2019 YOY change Revenue $201.1 million $153.8 million 30.7% Loss from operations ($45.9 million) ($135.0 million) N\/A Graduate program segment profitability 8.0% 1.2% +6.8 percentage points Alternative credential segment profitability (7.6%) (23.7%) +16.1 percentage points Cash and cash equivalents $481.3 million $154.1 million 212.3% Long-term debt $268.2 million $245.9 million 9.1% Net cash used in operating activities* ($6.9 million) ($85.7 million) N\/A *For the first three quarters of 2020 and 2019, respectively. Data from company earnings report. Table by author. Even before the coronavirus, the value of an ever-increasing cost of higher education has been put into question. Tuition costs since 1998 have more than doubled. With COVID-19 driving the on-campus experience online, many students are wondering if an expensive degree is really worth it. For the fall 2020 semester, enrollment for freshman college students is down an unprecedented 16% nationally, according to data from the National Student Clearinghouse Research Center. This deep drop in enrollment is putting colleges that were financially stretched in an even more tenuous financial situation. Image source: Getty Images. But there are even more headwinds for universities. Tech companies are getting in the game with alternative tools and educational opportunities. Amazon provides a platform for educators who want to publish educational material. Google, a subsidiary of Alphabet, provides tools to students and teachers while also offering Google-branded certificates for high-demand jobs like an IT support technician. IBM has its own skills academy, with state-of-the-art technological content provided for free.\u00a0 The coronavirus has accelerated the popularity of college-alternative programs. These less costly, highly-specific offerings will likely continue to attract students even after the pandemic is over.\u00a0 The coronavirus has heightened the acceptance of non-traditional educational paths. With large, deep-pocketed new entrants in the industry, it remains to be seen what long-term impact this increased competition could have. And the company is still heavily dependent on its graduate segment, where its partners control the pricing of programs. If tuition is priced too high, the program may struggle to attract students (resulting in decreased revenue share for 2U). If tuition is cut to make the program a more attractive value, that also reduces 2U's revenue share. This is an especially critical decision now that higher education faces more uncertainty than ever. Management is making all the right moves, but in the end, this company is a service provider, tightly tied to the success of its university partners. I suggest investors stay on the sidelines for now."

    "article_text":"The move from the British government comes as tech giants face new challenges in the European Union within weeks, when draft proposals for legislation governing digital markets come on Dec. 9. The back story. In July, Britain\u2019s Competition and Markets Authority released the results of a year-long study into online platforms and the digital advertising market in the U.K. The study specifically investigated the market power of Google and Facebook, describing how the companies overwhelmingly dominate in online search, social media, and advertising, and enjoy incumbency advantages that protect them against rivals and reduce competition. In March, the CMA was asked to lead a Digital Markets Taskforce to advise the government on the design of a new regulatory regime for digital markets. That task force is due to provide its proposals before the end of the year. What\u2019s new. The British government announced on Friday that it would set up a Digital Markets Unit within the CMA to oversee pro-competition reforms in the tech sector. The new unit will begin operating in April 2021. \u201cDigital platforms like Google and Facebook make a significant contribution to our economy and play a massive role in our day-to-day lives,\u201d said Alok Sharma, Britain\u2019s business secretary. \u201cBut the dominance of just a few big tech companies is leading to less innovation, higher advertising prices and less choice and control for consumers.\u201d The regulator will establish rules to govern platforms funded by digital advertising that have \u201cstrategic market status\u201d\u2014the designation of which is another task of the new body. Its mandate includes introducing pro-competition interventions around user data, consumer choice, and could extend to breaking up businesses. Andrea Coscelli, the CMA\u2019s chief executive, said that \u201conly through a new pro-competition regulatory regime can we tackle the market power of tech giants like Facebook and Google and ensure that businesses and consumers are protected.\u201d Looking ahead. Make no mistake: the creation of a new tech regulator with a mandate to target companies like Google and Facebook is trouble for big tech. It comes as these same companies are already facing down the barrel of strict regulation across the English Channel making Europe stand out as a trouble spot. It\u2019s difficult to tell how deep new intervention will run. The CMA\u2019s chief executive has been aggressive in calling out Google and Facebook, but the U.K.\u2019s business secretary was right to note the \u201csignificant contribution\u201d these companies make to the British economy. Regulation like this could very well become a major political issue."

    "url":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/microstrategy-simon-property-group-snap-162904783.html",
    "article_text":"Chicago, IL \u2013 November 27, 2020 \u2013 Zacks Equity Research highlights MicroStrategy MSTR as the Bull of the Day and Simon Property Group SPG as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on\u00a0Snap SNAP, Alphabet GOOGL and Facebook FB. Here is a synopsis of all five stocks: MicroStrategy made a big bet on Bitcoin (BTC) this year, and it turns out it may have been the best decision this company's management has ever made. MicroStrategy is a cloud-based business analytics company that has stayed below investors' radars with quarterly income statements that weren't exciting anyone. CEO Michael Saylor flipped the narrative when it started purchasing Bitcoin in August. With its enormous bitcoin purchase and a sales outlook that is looking a whole lot brighter as its licensing and subscription-based sales soars, analysts are increasingly optimistic about the future of this business, pushing MSTR into a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). MicroStrategy became the largest American corporation to invest in bitcoin as a 'store of value' when it purchased 38,250 coins between August and September for an average price of $11,111 per coin ($425 million in value), giving it the institutional seal of approval. Now fintech giants like Square and PayPal are buying up large sums of the pioneering blockchain currency. This big institutional bid has Bitcoin soaring in the past few months. BTC was trading below $10,000 as recently as September, a price it has struggled to stay above since the end of the Crypto-Craze in the first months of 2018. Bitcoin hit resistance at its 2017 high this week and pulled back to below $17, but I don't believe this rally is over.\u00a0 MicroStrategy has already netted a $286 million (68%) gain on its Bitcoin purchase in just three months, and it looks like the cryptocurrency is headed beyond $20k. I expect that more and more institutions will follow suit, adding to Bitcoins already red-hot momentum. Saylor made a seemingly savvy business decision when he decided to store his enterprise's liquid capital in Bitcoin. He made this judgment call in the face of ultra-low interest rates that were poised to eat away at MicroStrategy's cash reserve value. Jerome Powell and the Federal Reserve are printing money like there's no tomorrow and vowing to let inflation run past its 2% target to make up for the past two decades of below-target inflation. MicroStrategy's management team felt that gold is an antiquated store of value and that Bitcoin's blockchain-driven cryptocurrency is the future of inflation-protected assets. The world of finance is shifting rapidly, and MicroStrategy is leading the shift towards blockchain-powered balance sheet management. Today roughly 1\/3rd of MSTR's market value is derived from Bitcoin, and its share price changes have been highly correlated with BTC's price action. I see MSTR as a hedged way to invest in the resurgence of the Crypto-Craze that I expect to continue into next year. MicroStrategy was an unfortunate product of the late '90's tech bubble. MSTR surged over 3300% from May of 1999 to its high in early March of 2000, topping out at $3330. A year and a half later, MSTR was trading in the single digits, having lost over 99% of its peak value. The company has been chugging along with little growth, but it appears that MicroStrategy is finally turning the heaters back on, resurging this digitally incepted enterprise back into growth. The shrewd Bitcoin purchase was just one lever exemplifying MSTR's growth potential. The business's newly released HyperIntellegence platform has been met with strong demand, and its other segments are all enjoying 2020's digital tailwind with the rapid adaptation of MicroStrategy's cloud technology. I expect that the business's resurgence into growth will continue throughout the digitally-driven Roaring 20s. If you want to invest in the second wave of Bitcoin mania, MSTR is an excellent (hedged) way to do so. Keep in mind that these shares will still be quite correlated with BTC's highly volatile price. I would not recommend a large position in this enterprise, but it is one that is worth looking into. The retail apocalypse hit the fan in 2020 as foot-traffic halted and click-traffic surged. The retail sector has seen a massive divergence this year. Digital-inclined omnichannel retailers and e-commerce shopping platforms far outperformed the plummeting shares of legacy retailers. Simon Property Group is starting to feel the adverse implications of the declining retail sector. A sizable portion of its traditional brick-and-mortar clients are reaching a breaking point. Many have been forced into bankruptcy, closing their storefronts and defaulting on their lease obligations with Simon Property. SPG is the best-in-class real estate investment trust (REIT) for shopping, dining, and entertainment, but unfortunately, its clientele are operating in a declining industry. The post-pandemic\u00a0New Normal\u00a0is going to be one that is driven by click-traffic while foot-traffic falls. Analysts have been increasingly pessimistic about this business's future, dropping EPS estimates for years to come and pushing SPG into a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). With 2 high potential vaccines on the horizon, investors & traders are beginning to price foot-traffic back into the markets with a light at the end of the COVID tunnel. The beat-up traditional retailer space has been catching a bid in the past couple of weeks as the equity markets move up the timeline to full economic recovery. Since Pfizer's first vaccine announcement earlier this month, SPG has jumped 41%, but is this move justified? Despite the revived optimism about 2021, COVID cases have been surging, and we may be in for a cold economic winter, with states already beginning to lockdown again. Brick-and-mortar retailers are in for more pain before the end of the pandemic. The night is always darkest before the dawn, and this statement has never been truer than it is for traditional storefronts today. The retail apocalypse has been occurring for the past 5 years as the ease of shopping right from your couch has reduced foot-traffic levels in malls and shopping centers. This has been devastating for mall operators like Simon Property Group, as well as department stores, many of which have filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy. I believe that the pandemic is cleaning house. Getting rid of antiquated business models that were already on their way out and allowing well-adopted retail businesses that provide what consumers want\/need to thrive. SPG is the best-in-class REIT of a dying sector, but it will need to make some structural changes in order to adapt to the shifting consumer. Some value investors may argue that there is still opportunity in the 'heavily discounted' department stores. Still, I'm not chasing these antiquated names unless they can flip the obsolescence narrative and adapt to the rapidly changing consumer. Snaprecently introduced an entertainment-based feature on the Snapchat app called Spotlight, where it will highlight creative short videos from users, in an effort to compete with China-based ByteDance\u2019s TikTok app. Spotlight features auto-playing vertical videos, which can be swiped up or down to quickly move between clips.\u00a0 It is designed to highlight entertaining videos from all users, regardless of the number of followers or influence they have. The new feature is available in the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, UK, Ireland, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Germany, and France. Markedly, Snap shares declined 2.1% to close on $44.29 on Nov 24, following the announcement, apparently reflecting strong competition Spotlight is expected to face from TikTok. Snap\u2019s shares have returned 171.3% year to date compared with the Zacks Internet - Software industry\u2019s growth of 89.4%. On Snapchat, likes are private with no options for re-sharing of videos. Moreover, displaying follower numbers is optional. Without such metrics, it can be tough for Spotlight videos to get popular, thus affecting chances of users to get noticed by brands and advertisers or get hired to create sponsored content. Additionally, Spotlight content will be moderated by human reviewers and AI before it gets to 100 views and will not be distributed further until it has passed moderation. Snapchat user profiles are individual by default, so snaps will not be instantly pressed to a big audience. Moreover, those who share Snaps from a private account will also see their account details remain private on Spotlight. Public comments on videos are not allowed. Nonetheless, the company confirmed that as an early incentive for users to try out the new feature, it will give over $1 million dollars every day until the end of this year to those who create the most engaging Snaps on Spotlight. Markedly, users must be over 16 and where applicable get parental consent to be considered for the funds. With over 249 million daily active users reported at the end of third-quarter 2020, Snap is looking to leverage more than 4 billion daily Snaps created by its users to power the new Spotlight feed. Creative video-sharing has become increasingly popular on social media platforms, accelerated by the rise of TikTok, which remains one of the top apps with around 50 million daily active users (DAUs) in the United States till August. TikTok plans to spend more than $1 billion in the next three years on video-makers in the United States. Over the weekend, TikTok saw its first creator reach 100 million followers. Charli D\u2019Amelio has hit that mark just 18 months after she created her account. TikTok\u2019s success led Alphabet owned Google to add short-form videos to its YouTube app. Meanwhile, Facebook has added an equivalent function in the type of Reels for Instagram. Instagram has been paying some of TikTok\u2019s top stars to test out Reels. Moreover, Instagram recently started sharing revenues for the first time on video ads with creators like YouTube does. Nonetheless, Snap is expected to intensify competition for its peers, given its strong popularity among millennials. Competition among social media apps for the attention of younger users has been intense and most notable is the case of Snapchat\u2019s disappearing Stories feature, which has since then been introduced to LinkedIn, Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, among others, earlier this month. Markedly, in the United States, Snapchat platform reaches 90% of 13-24 year-olds, which is more than Facebook, Instagram and Messenger combined. It also reaches 75% of all 13 to 34-year-olds and more than 4 billion Snaps are created every day on an average. Moreover, with the music licensing aspect handled by this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company\u2019s multi-year licensing agreements with several major record labels including Warner Music Group, Universal Music Publishing Group, Warner Chappell Music, Kobalt and BMG Music Publishing, the Spotlight feature is expected to gain popularity soon.

Apple sold a mere 1 billion iPhones in 10 years but a new breakthrough is expected to generate more than 27 billion devices in just 3 years, creating a $1.7 trillion market.

    "headline":"No Google-Fitbit merger without human rights remedies, says Amnesty to EU",
    "url":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/no-google-fitbit-merger-without-141740540.html",
    "article_text":"Amnesty warns now that Google is \"incentivized to merge and aggregate data across its different platforms\" as a consequence of that surveillance-based business model. \"Google\u2019s business model incentivizes the company to continuously seek more data on more people across the online world and into the physical world. The merger with Fitbit is a clear example of this expansionist approach to data extraction, enabling the company to extend its data collection into the health and wearables sector,\" it writes. \"The sheer scale of the intrusion of Google\u2019s business model into our private lives is an unprecedented interference with our privacy, and in fact has undermined the very essence of privacy.\" The commission has also voiced concerns about the risk of Google locking other wearable device makers out of its Android mobile ecosystem. However concerns over Google's plan to gobble up Fitbit range wider than the risk of it getting more market muscle if the deal gets waved through. Put simply, letting sensitive health data fall into the hands of an advertising giant is a privacy trash fire. The commission's decision to scrutinize the acquisition rather than waiving it through with a cursory look has led Google to make a number of concessions in an attempt to get it cleared -- including a pledge not to use Fitbit data for ad targeting and to guarantee support for other wearables makers to operate on Android. In its letter, Amnesty argues that the \"safeguards\" Google has offered are not enough. \"The European Data Protection Board has recognized the risks of the merger, stating that the \u201ccombination and accumulation of sensitive personal data\u201d by Google could entail a \u201chigh level of risk\u201d to the rights to privacy and data protection,\" it adds. As well as undermining people's privacy, Google's use of algorithms fed with personal data to generate profiles of internet users in order to predict their behavior erodes what Amnesty describes as \"the critical principle that all people should enjoy equal access to their human rights.\" \"This risk is heightened when profiling is deployed in contexts that touch directly on people\u2019s economic, social and cultural rights, such as the right to health where people may suffer unequal treatment based on predictions about their health, and as such must be taken into account in the context of health and fitness data,\" it suggests. \"This power of the platforms has not only exacerbated and magnified their rights impacts but has also created a situation in which it is very difficult to hold the companies to account, or for those affected to access an effective remedy,\" Amnesty adds, noting that while big tech companies have faced a number of regulatory actions around the world none has so far been able to derail what it calls \"the fundamental drivers of the surveillance-based business model.\" So far the commission has stood firm in taking its time to consider the issue in detail. Per EU merger law, the commission college takes the final decision -- with a requirement to take \"utmost account\" of the opinion of the member states' advisory committee (though it's not legally binding). So it's ultimately up to Brussels to determine whether Google-Fitbit gets green lit. She has also voiced opposition to breaking up tech giants, again preferring to advocate for imposing controls on how they can use data as a way to rebalance digital markets. Simultaneously, EU lawmakers are working on a proposal for an ex ante regulation to address competition concerns in digital markets that would put specific rules and obligations on dominant players like Google -- again in areas such as data use and data access. That plan is due to be presented early next month -- so it's another factor that may be adding to delay the commission's Google-Fitbit decision."

    "article_text":"(Bloomberg) -- New York-based businesswoman Ruth Harrigan usually sells her honey and beeswax products in souvenir shops. But with Covid-19 pausing tourism, she\u2019s been almost entirely dependent on Facebook ads to drive online sales. On Nov. 11, this new financial lifeline was abruptly cut when the social media company blocked her HoneyGramz ad account for violating its policies. She couldn\u2019t imagine what about her tiny honey-filled gifts would have triggered the problem. Friends told Harrigan to just wait a couple of days and the problem might resolve itself. She waited, until she lost an estimated $5,000 in revenue. \u201cI was getting a little anxious thinking, \u2018Oh my God, Black Friday is around the corner, most of my sales for the year happen in November and December and that\u2019s it,\u2019\u201d she explained. \u201cI said, \u2018If I\u2019m shut down any longer than this, it\u2019ll cripple me.\u2019\u201d Harrigan is one of millions of small business advertisers who have come to rely on Facebook Inc. because the coronavirus has shut down many traditional retail channels. The social media giant has provided new sales opportunities for these entrepreneurs, but also exposed them to the company\u2019s misfiring content-moderation software, limited options for customer support and lack of transparency about how to fix problems. Facebook\u2019s human moderators have focused on election and Covid-19 misinformation this year, so the company has leaned more on artificial intelligence algorithms to monitor other areas of the platform. That\u2019s left many small businesses caught in Facebook\u2019s automated filters, unable to advertise through the service and frustrated because they don\u2019t know why. The same weekend Harrigan\u2019s account went down, Ivonne Sanchez, who runs a permanent makeup clinic in Ottawa, found her ads were blocked too, for what Facebook said was a \u201cpolicy violation.\u201d Her business, which had to shut down between March and June for the pandemic, was relying on Facebook to recover financially. The account was restored the next day without explanation, but \u201cin the middle of a crucial shopping season, it left us shaken,\u201d she said. \u201cThis experience makes us very nervous about investing dollars into a system that is operated seemingly by a bot.\u201d \u201cIt just exploded. They turned up the AI recently -- somebody changed something -- and all of the sudden everybody was getting shut down.\u201d -- Justin Brooke, founder of Adskills.com Even if an ad account gets restored, businesses lose crucial momentum. Facebook\u2019s advertising algorithm takes a couple of weeks to figure out which users may be interested in an ad, to refine the targeting. Jessica Grossman, chief executive officer of digital marketing firm In Social, said when her clients get hit, the hardest part is telling them their campaigns have to start over and their money won\u2019t go as far. \u201cFacebook almost doesn\u2019t realize the impact of their own algorithm and what that means,\u201d Grossman said. There seemed to be no logic to the account bans imposed on In Social\u2019s clients, she added. A pizza vending machine company, a reusable water bottle company, a coffee delivery service, a business coach and a hair weave company were all suspended. \u201cWe know it can be frustrating to experience any type of business disruption, especially at such a critical time of the year,\u201d Facebook said in a statement. \u201cWhile we offer free support for all businesses, we regularly work to improve our tools and systems, and to make the support we offer easier to use and access. We apologize for any inconvenience recent disruptions may have caused.\u201d Facebook often touts its commitment to small businesses, as it defends its ever larger hold over their economic future. On a recent earnings call, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said this was a \u201cmajor focus\u201d that\u2019s \u201cmore important now than ever\u201d as Covid-19 shifts commerce online. During a July ad boycott by major brands, Facebook\u2019s revenue still grew, bolstered by small businesses rushing online to try to survive. The company added more tools this year for small businesses to sell directly to customers through its site, hoping these virtual shops become advertisers, too. But while business owners agree that Facebook is a lifeline during the pandemic, they say it\u2019s also an unreliable partner. Facebook\u2019s ban on political ads around the U.S. election, for instance, affected companies that have no connection to politics, like a business selling bracelets to benefit refugees. A seed company was also blocked for sharing a picture of Walla Walla onions -- which were \u201covertly sexual,\u201d according to Facebook\u2019s AI. The company\u2019s policies against cryptocurrency frequently trapped ads from a solar roof company, Human SOLR, because some of the acronyms used by the business are similar to cryptocurrency tokens. After that issue was resolved, Human SOLR\u2019s ads were banned again for using phrases like \u201csee if your roof qualifies.\u201d Facebook\u2019s software guessed the company was selling financial products, which are more regulated. After enough flags on the account, Brett Lee, who runs the business, gave up on Facebook ads. \u201cMy business is at a complete standstill,\u201d said Lee, based in St. George, Utah. \u201cMy employees\u2019 lives are at a standstill.\u201d GFP Delivered, a Chicago-based produce company advertising a way for people to avoid the grocery store during Covid-19, had its Facebook ads shut down for two months without clear explanation, according to owner George Fourkas. He said he was able to fix the problem only after reaching out to old college friends who work at Facebook. Yaniv Gershom, co-founder of digital marketing firm 4AM Media, said he had to cut 12 jobs partly because of Facebook ad account bans, which have lasted almost six months. \u201cThey give you zero feedback,\u201d he added. \u201cThe only people who are OK are massive spenders who get a Facebook rep that can escalate issues and find out what\u2019s wrong.\u201d In some cases, the business impact is hard to quantify. Matt Snow, co-founder of an apparel business called Boredwalk, said Facebook\u2019s automated systems inadvertently flagged 40% of his company\u2019s product catalog as unsafe late last month. That left Snow targeting the wrong products to potential customers. He eventually noticed and quickly resolved the issue with a Facebook sales manager, but Snow doesn\u2019t know how long the products were banned, or even which other items were being advertised in their place. \u201cFacebook is very black box about all their internal machinations,\u201d he said. Facebook has been automating content moderation for years, a transition it highlights in a quarterly report detailing how much content the company removes. In more nuanced categories such as \u201chate speech,\u201d Facebook removed almost 95% of violating posts automatically in the third quarter, up from just 53% two years ago. But that increase comes with more corrections. Facebook removed 22 million posts for hate speech in the third quarter, more than 3 times as many as a year earlier. The number of posts it later restored jumped by 40%. Appealing these often-automated decisions has also become a lot harder. \u201cDue to a temporary reduction in our review capacity as a result of Covid-19, we could not always offer our users the option to appeal,\u201d Facebook wrote in its third-quarter report. Advertisers have been particularly hurt by these automated decisions in recent months. \u201cIt just exploded. They turned up the AI recently -- somebody changed something -- and all of the sudden everybody was getting shut down,\u201d said Justin Brooke, founder of Adskills.com, which teaches businesses how to market on Facebook. \u201cWhat are these small businesses going to do? They\u2019ve got families to feed.\u201d One of Brooke\u2019s own Facebook ads has a small written disclaimer saying it wasn\u2019t open to those trying to sell adult content. That got flagged and taken down. Facebook\u2019s automated explanation? The post didn\u2019t follow the company\u2019s community standards on \u201cnudity\/sexual activity.\u201d The over-reaction by Facebook\u2019s AI is a side effect of the company taking more responsibility for the content on its platform, according to Guy Rosen, Facebook\u2019s vice president of integrity. \u201cAs we take more action, we remove more content, there\u2019s more opportunities also for those to be in error,\u201d he said during a recent press call. That\u2019s what HoneyGramz\u2019s Harrigan was told happened to her account. She eventually got desperate enough to Google names of Facebook employees who might help. She found Rob Leathern, the company\u2019s director of ad products, and sent him a message on Twitter. Miraculously, he responded. A few hours later, Facebook sent an email restoring her account. \u201cThey just said they turned it off in error,\u201d Harrigan said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t give me any feedback. They just reset the whole thing as if it never happened.\u201d But Harrigan won\u2019t forget. She printed off the email and pinned it to her office whiteboard. \u201cIt was really, really scary,\u201d she said. (Adds chart after ninth paragraph.) \u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P."

    "article_text":"Image source: Getty Images. In some ways, it makes sense that Tesla is more valuable than legacy automakers. It's growing faster, isn't bogged down by a dealer network, and generates higher margins. But the price-to-sale and price-to-earnings ratios you see below show that Tesla's valuation is insanely high compared to these companies.\u00a0 The excitement about Tesla's business is understandable. Customers are extremely loyal and love their vehicles. But I think disruption is coming to the auto business long before Tesla lives up to its current valuation, and that's why the stock has run too far, too fast.\u00a0 Several popular EV names in the U.S. aren't yet in production. One that actually does have a product and is on investors' radar is electric-delivery truck maker Workhorse Group.\u00a0 Workhorse's niche is the \"last mile\" box truck for short-distance deliveries. Its two C-Series electric trucks offer 650- or 1000-cubic- foot cargo space, and have 100 miles of range. While there's a good reason for interest in this company, its 2021 production volume target is just 1,800 vehicles.\u00a0 The company has also applied for Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certification for its HorseFly unmanned drone \"that can deliver parcels, carry sensors and cameras and operate autonomously with a high degree of precision.\"\u00a0 While there's reason to like Workhorse for its long-term potential, there are many hurdles, including potential competition, for it to be a successful business. Its valuation today looks well beyond what is reasonable, making it a prime candidate to retrench when investors focus their excitement elsewhere. I'm betting this one has run too far, too fast.\u00a0 That's an incredible haul if you picked up shares of the micro-cap company earlier this year. The problem is, with a market cap now approaching $1 billion, the market is now paying an insanely high multiple for the company's future prospects.\u00a0 As the chart shows, Blink's cash burn rate is accelerating, meaning it will need to raise more cash, and probably relatively soon. With the stock price having raced higher, management would be smart to take advantage of this opportunity to raise cash with a secondary offering -- even with the downside for investors being dilution as a result. Frankly, Blink needs\u00a0to be spending money to build out its business now.\u00a0 But at almost 200 times sales, don't count me among the investors looking to buy shares of the company just yet. The business is just too small, and there's a lot of risk if it doesn't get a secure enough foothold in the EV charging business to deliver on the growth potential. Today's nearly billion-dollar valuation could run out of juice even more quickly than it charged up.\u00a0 The electric vehicle industry is growing, and there's a lot to like long-term. But the automotive industry isn't typically a very profitable industry, and there's a limit to how many vehicles people will buy in a year. That should put some trepidation into the market, and these three stocks could fall back to earth if the growth story is upset in any way.\u00a0"

In August, Guardant Health's Guardant360 CDx became the first liquid biopsy test approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for comprehensive tumor mutation profiling across all solid cancers. Liquid biopsies are tests that analyze DNA fragments of tumors in the blood. Comprehensive tumor mutation profiling enables the identification of specific types of cancers, which can be used to determine the most effective treatment.\u00a0 Guardant Health is on track to generate revenue of close to $300 million this year. That's only a drop in the bucket compared to the $6 billion potential U.S. market that Guardant360 CDx targets.\u00a0 The market for Guardant360 also pales in comparison to the estimated total addressable U.S. market of more than $45 billion for Guardant Health's LUNAR liquid biopsy tests. The company is evaluating two tests in clinical studies: LUNAR-1 for cancer recurrence monitoring and adjuvant (secondary) cancer treatment and LUNAR-2 for early stage cancer detection. If these products are successful, Guardant Health will become a much bigger company over the next few years. The company offers arguably the best cloud-based database on the market. In October, MongoDB announced that its Atlas product is the first cloud database that enables customers to run applications simultaneously on all major cloud providers -- Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure. This could be a big draw for customers who want to leverage the strengths offered by each cloud provider. Organizations are flocking to the cloud. The COVID-19 pandemic has only accelerated this migration. At the end of 2019, MongoDB claimed more than 15,900 customers in over 100 countries. Its customer count now tops 20,200, with nearly 19,000 of them using Atlas.\u00a0 Despite its tremendous growth, MongoDB's market cap is still only around $15.5 billion. The company remains a much smaller player than the leaders in the database market. This relatively small size combined with an enormous market should give MongoDB plenty of room to run. This company is a textbook case of being in the right place at the right time. The Trade Desk markets the leading software platform for advertisers to buy digital ads. The rise of connected TV (CTV) -- televisions connected to the internet -- has created a massive opportunity for digital advertising. The company plans to launch one of its biggest platform upgrades ever in 2021. The last big upgrade in 2018 fueled significant market share gains for The Trade Desk. If history repeats itself, more big gains could be right around the corner. With CTV still only in its early stages, The Trade Desk should remain in the right place at the right time for years to come."

    "article_text":"The UK will impose new rules next year aimed at preventing Google and Facebook from abusing their market dominance. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said the two firms accounted for around 80% of the \u00a314bn ($18.7bn) spent on advertising online in 2019. The new regime will attempt to give consumers more control over their data. It will also \"help small businesses thrive, and ensure news outlets are not forced out by bigger rivals,\" according to the government. \"There is growing consensus in the UK and abroad that the concentration of power among a small number of tech companies is curtailing growth of the sector, reducing innovation and having negative impacts on the people and businesses that rely on them,\" said Digital Secretary Oliver Dowden, in a statement. \"It's time to address that and unleash a new age of tech growth.\" The new code will set clear expectations for the most powerful firms over what represents acceptable behaviour when interacting with competitors and users. Platforms that are funded by digital advertising could be required to be more transparent about the services they provide and how they are using consumers' data. They will be expected to give consumers a choice over whether to receive personalised advertising, and prevented from placing restrictions on their customers that make it hard for them to use rival platforms. The code will be enforced by a new dedicated unit within the CMA. The Digital Markets Unit could be given powers to suspend, block and reverse decisions made by technology firms and to impose financial penalties for non-compliance. Google and Facebook have previously said they are committed to working with the British government and regulator on digital advertising. The new code could also affect the media industry, which has lost much of its advertising revenues to Facebook and Google. The new code will attempt to govern commercial arrangements between publishers and platforms to help keep publishers in business. It will try to stop online platforms from imposing unfair terms on news publishers that limit their ability to monetise their content."

    "url":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/jamie-oliver-turns-leftover-mashed-060015576.html",
    "article_text":"(Bloomberg) -- Editor\u2019s Note: As more people are working from home, Bloomberg Pursuits is running a weekly Lunch Break column that highlights a notable recipe from a favorite cookbook and the hack that makes it genius. This holiday season, let\u2019s gives thanks for mashed potatoes. They are the MVPs of the industry, a mainstay of weekday dinners, and the anchor of so many festive dinners. According to Google Trends data, they have been, unsurprisingly, the most popular side dish for American Thanksgiving. Mashed potatoes are, however, invariably a supporting player behind more muscular turkeys, prime ribs, roast chicken, and anything that might come with a bowl of gravy. Jamie Oliver invites you to rethink the possibilities. The ever-popular British cook catapulted to international prominence as the Naked Chef in the late \u201990s. Now, he might be known as the Data Chef. In his new cookbook, 7 Ways: Easy Ideas for Every Day of the Week (Flatiron Books; $35), Oliver worked with major supermarkets across the U.K. to determine the ingredients consumers buy most. \u201cMy dream was to try and write the most accessible cookbook I\u2019ve ever written,\u201d says Oliver via a phone interview. What that means, he adds, is considering what people have on hand, as well as cost, variety, and of course, flavor. \u201cI used data to drive this creation. It\u2019s not glamorous, and I don\u2019t typically like it, but it\u2019s fascinating. We were churning through thousands of items at major supermarkets. I wanted to study food that most of us buy every week.\u201d From his research, Oliver determined 30 of the most popular foods purchased at supermarkets. He then selected 18 to feature in his book\u2014seven different ways, per the title\u2014with the goal of staving off boredom for home cooks whose supermarket habits are on repeat. They\u2019re all obvious and accessible: salmon, chicken breasts, avocado, shrimp. His steak chapter, for instance, includes South American-styled chimichurri, a Chinese stir-fry with ginger, and a pepper-crusted number with whisky sauce. Likewise, Oliver\u2019s potato chapter ranges from Indian-accented baked potatoes to a potato \u201clasagna\u201d (aka gratin) made by layering slices in a creamy cheese sauce. Most compelling is his savory pie with a mashed potato \u201ccrust.\u201d \u201cI pair spring onions and tomatoes with oozy cheese to create the perfect flavor contrast with the soft, creamy mash\u2014which also has a pleasingly crispy outer edge,\u201d says Oliver. In fact, the dish radiates comfort. Oliver calls for two kinds of cheddar in his dish, but it\u2019s wide open to interpretation. \u201cFeel free to mix up the cheese, based on what you\u2019ve got.\u201d The most important part is the golden potato crust. While mashed potatoes feature as a topping for such classics as shepherd\u2019s pie and moussaka, it\u2019s not so common to find them working as the bottom layer, too. Though it\u2019s firm enough to cut into slices, the pie could double as a dressed-up casserole. You could just spoon it onto plates in one gorgeous pile. The tomatoes add a refreshing bite but they\u2019re not necessary. Hot sauce makes a great addition, if you\u2019re so inclined. Even as everyone is scaling down this year\u2019s Thanksgiving feast, it\u2019s hard not to overestimate how much mashed potatoes you\u2019ll want. Leftovers are inevitable\u2014and now, very welcome. \u201cThis one is perfect if you\u2019ve made a bumper batch of mash,\u201d says Oliver, and then shouts: \u201cHappy holidays!\u201d The following recipe is adapted from 7 Ways: Easy Ideas for Every Day of the Week, by Jamie Oliver. Testers Note: This recipe works best with drier mashed potatoes, ones made without excessive milk and butter. Of course, that\u2019s not what most people want for Thanksgiving. If you have extra creamy mashed potatoes, cook them down so they\u2019re as dense as possible. Mash in an additional boiled potato or two, if you have them. If you have less mashed potato, you can make this pie in a smaller baking dish, with less filling. It\u2019s supremely adaptable. Crispy Cheesy Mashed Potato Pie Serves 4 to 6 3 lb. Yukon gold potatoes; if using leftover mashed potatoes, you\u2019ll need about 6 cups2\/3 lb. ripe tomatoes (optional)1 large bunch of scallions, sliced 3 oz. sharp cheddar cheese, coarsely grated 3 oz. aged cheddar, coarsely gratedSalt and freshly ground pepper4 tbsp. unsalted butter, or to tasteExtra virgin olive oil, for brushingHot sauce, for serving (optional) Peel the potatoes and chop into even-sized chunks. Cook in a large pan of boiling salted water until tender, about 15 minutes. Meanwhile, if using tomatoes, halve them, squeeze out the seeds, and dice the flesh. Toss with a good pinch of sea salt and transfer to a sieve to drain. Press out any excess liquid from the tomatoes and mix with the scallions and cheese. Check for seasoning. Preheat the oven to 400F. Drain the potatoes, then mash really well with the butter and season to perfection. Once cool enough to handle, use oiled hands to flatten a little more than half the mashed potatoes in the bottom and a bit up the sides of a 12- by 8-inch nonstick baking pan. Spread the tomato-cheese mixture over the bottom, almost to the edges. Press the remaining mashed potatoes on top, smoothing it out and covering the filling. Make a pattern, if you like on the edge. Brush the top of the pie with olive oil and bake for about 40 minutes, or until golden and crisp. Let cool slightly, then slice. Serve with hot sauce, if desired. \u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P."

    "headline":"Here's Why Electric Vehicle Stocks Have Exploded This Year",
    "url":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/heres-why-electric-vehicle-stocks-000000977.html",
    "article_text":"The electric vehicle boom has been one of the few bright spots for investors in 2020. Tesla has seen its stock price climb by more than 445% this year. NIO stocks have soared by more than 1070%. And even charging companies like PLUG have seen their stock prices rise by more than 630%. In what has been a perfect storm for this nascent sector, traditional companies have seen their value destroyed, the world\u2019s biggest hedge funds have started to redirect their investments towards ESG stocks and multiple governments are preparing for a clean energy transition as the COVID recovery begins. But amidst all this good news - and what seems to be an irreversible shift in sentiment in global markets - one of the most impressive EV developments of the decade seems to have gone under the radar. The EV industry has finally solved its most pressing problem: accessibility. Electric vehicles are finally making the move from being a luxury for the rich to the transportation of the many.\u00a0 The electric vehicle revolution is well and truly underway, and for investors, 2020 is only the beginning.\u00a0 Solving A Major EV Problem Despite all the hype around electric vehicles and the incredible rate of technological breakthroughs, the truth is that sales of electric vehicles are increasing at a painfully slow rate. There are two main reasons for this. Electric vehicles are yet to reach price competitiveness with gasoline-powered cars. The rate of improvement in the technology means any EV you buy today will likely be outdated within a year or two. But all of that is about to change. Because when electric cars become the norm, the entire model of the auto industry will have to change.\u00a0 Just like we all race to get the latest iPhone model or the most modern computer \u2013 our desire for the newest electric vehicle will be undeniable.\u00a0 An electric vehicle subscription service like Steer will not only solve the single biggest problem that the EV industry faces, ultimately it could help make electric vehicles the only acceptable choice for most consumers. An ESG Revolution By now, the entire investment world is aware of the Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) trend that is taking over markets.\u00a0 The CEO of the world\u2019s largest asset manager, Blackrock, believes that we are \u201con the edge of a fundamental reshaping of finance\u201d. And when a company with more than $7 trillion under management says markets are about to change, it\u2019s generally a good idea to listen. For Facedrive this transformation could not have come at a better time. The company is determined to become the first-ever entirely ESG ecosystem, working on everything from emissions-free transportation and food delivery, to community-centered social and sports apps, and a COVID-tracing system designed to counter the global pandemic.\u00a0 It\u2019s a business model that has sent Facedrive\u2019s market cap above $1 billion and has forced industry giants to go on the defensive. Ultimately, the era of public companies chasing profit at the expense of all else is essentially over. For a modern company to be viable, it must account for and counter any negative impact on local communities or the environment. As the ESG revolution picks up pace, this people-and-planet first approach to business has already grabbed the attention of some incredibly powerful and influential figures. Big Names Making Big Moves It is no secret that some of the biggest names in investment, tech, and finance are determined to use their money for good. Elon Musk, Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, and nearly every other tech billionaire have committed huge sums of money to their pursuit of \u2018making the world a better place\u2019. Facebook\u2019s purchase of Steer has seen energy giant Exelon come on board. And the COVID tracing technology developed by Facedrive got support from Air Canada, the Canadian government, and Microsoft. Facedrive has found itself at a crossroads where big names, big money, and big ideas are all colliding.\u00a0 And now its electric vehicle subscription service is promising to help accelerate the hottest investment sector of 2020. As far as Facedrive is concerned, the future has already arrived. Other Companies Riding The ESG Wave Tech giants are among the leaders in the sustainability push. Facebook, Microsoft, Apple and Google have all made massive commitments to the cause, paving a path for others in the industry to do the same. In 2019, Facebook became the number one corporate buyer of renewable energy in the United States, and second in the world. It has also made major investments in developing renewable projects in Texas, Ireland, Denmark and Norway. Facebook has even gone a step further with its focus on building more sustainable workplaces. It\u2019s building designs incorporate a number of renewable energy sources and water recycling methods, in addition to promoting the recycling and sustainability of all products consumed on site. The tech giant has made numerous investments in clean energy across the globe. From Ohio to the Netherlands, Microsoft is pouring millions into solar and wind projects to not only help reduce its own carbon footprint, but also help neighboring communities do the same. In addition to its investments and green operations, Microsoft is also building the next generation of hardware and software to help the world reduce its dependence on fossil fuels. Its Azure IoT, for example, connects and manages internet-connected solar panels to improve efficiency and open a line for an entirely new way of sharing energy within communities. Conor Kelly, the software engineer who is leading the distributed solar energy project for Microsoft Azure IoT explained, \u201cWe need to decarbonize the global economy to avoid catastrophic climate change,\u201d adding, \u201cThe first thing we can do, and the easiest thing we can do, is focus on electricity.\u201d Its focus is on raising the bar for smarter and more efficient use of the world\u2019s limited resources. It is building sustainable, energy-efficient data centers and workplaces. It is also harnessing artificial intelligence to utilize energy more efficiently. \u00a0 Google CEO Sundar Pichai explained, \u201cWe are committed to doing our part. Sustainability has been a core value for us since Larry and Sergey founded Google two decades ago. We were the first major company to become carbon neutral in 2007. We were the first major company to match our energy use with 100 percent renewable energy in 2017. We operate the cleanest global cloud in the industry, and we\u2019re the world\u2019s largest corporate purchaser of renewable energy.\u201d Apple has made significant moves towards renewables. All of Apple\u2019s operations run on 100% renewable energy, and it is even extending this philosophy to its distributors and manufacturers. Not only have they decreased their average product\u2019s energy use by 70 percent. They\u2019ve reduced their total carbon footprint by more than 35 percent in just a few short years. All while securing the title as the World\u2019s First Trillion Dollar Company \"We proved that 100 percent renewable is 100 percent doable. All our facilities worldwide\u2014including Apple offices, retail stores, and data centers\u2014are now powered entirely by clean energy. But this is just the beginning of how we\u2019re reducing greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to climate change. We\u2019re continuing to go further than most companies in measuring our carbon footprint, including manufacturing and product use. And we\u2019re making great progress in those areas too,\" CEO Tim Cook explained. As such, Total is not only betting big on renewable energy, it is also doing its part in reducing emissions in its day-to-day activities. Patrick Pouyann\u00e9, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer at Total noted, \u201cIt\u2019s our job to meet growing energy needs while reducing carbon emissions.\u201d It's also one of the most conscious companies in the business. Total checks every box in the ESG checklist. It is promoting diversity and safety, making massive changes in its operations to ensure that its business is environmentally sound, and has even committed to going carbon neutral by 2050 or sooner. It\u2019s no surprise that shareholders are loving its forward-thinking approach. Canadian companies are doing their part as well:  Telecom giant Shaw Communications Inc (TSE:SJR.B) is a great example. Shaw is taking a leadership role among Canadian telecom providers through its use of renewable energy, In fact, it is one of the biggest customers of Bullfrog Power which sources its electricity from a blend of wind energy and hydropower. It is also building its own portfolio of clean energy investments. In addition to its green energy investments, it\u2019s also embarked on an initiative to power its data centers with renewables and even implemented software to create more efficient routes for its drivers which will reduce BCE Inc (TSX:BCE)) is another Canadian telecom giant going to great lengths to reduce its carbon footprint. In fact, the company was named one of Canada\u2019s greenest employers in 2019. For the past 25 years, BCE has been at the forefront of the environmental movement. Their environmental management system (EMS) has been certified to be ISO 14001-compliant since 2009. In addition to its sustainability push, BCE is also a great place to work. It\u2019s one of the country\u2019s top family-friendly employers and has magnificent hiring practices, making it a great pick for ESG investors. Boralex Inc. (TSX:BLX) is a homegrown Canadian renewable firm. It has had a great influence in the adoption of renewable electricity domestically, and it\u2019s even branching out into the United States, France, and the United Kingdom. The company\u2019s primary energies are produced through wind, hydroelectric, thermal, and solar sources and help power the homes of many people across the world. Canada\u2019s Silicon Valley is joining the ESG race, too. Shopify Inc (TSX:SH) Canada\u2019s own e-commerce giant helps users build their own online stores. It has huge clients \u2013 everyone from Tesla to Budweiser are on board. And the company is beloved by millennial investors. In addition to its revolutionary approach to e-commerce, Shopify is playing an increasingly active role in creating a greener tomorrow. It has committed to spending at least $5 million annually to help combat climate change. It\u2019s even making cuts throughout its own operations, decommissioning its data centers, and sourcing renewable power for its buildings. By. Michael Kern **IMPORTANT!

    "headline":"GDPR enforcement must level up to catch big tech, report warns",
    "url":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/gdpr-enforcement-must-level-catch-141026751.html",
    "article_text":"But it could still be years before Google faces any regulatory action in Europe related to its location tracking. But the case predated Google coming under the jurisdiction of the DPC. And Ireland's data regulator has to deal with a disproportionate number of multinational tech companies, given how many have established their EU base in the country. The commission's ambitious agenda for updating and expanding the EU's digital rules framework, means criticism of GDPR risks taking the shine off the DGA before the ink has dried on the proposal document -- putting pressure on lawmakers to find creative ways to unblock GDPR's enforcement \"bottleneck.\" (Creative because national agencies are responsible for day-to-day oversight, and member states are responsible for resourcing DPAs.)  But they also conceded GDPR enforcement is lacking. Five months later European citizens are still waiting. This includes concerns of the Irish DPC making unnecessary \"information and admissibility checks;\" as well as rejecting complaints brought by an interested organization on the grounds they lack a mandate under Irish law, because it does not allow for third party redress (yet the Dutch consumer organization had filed the complaint under Dutch law which does \u2026). The report also queries why the DPC chose to open its own volition inquiry into Google's location data activities (rather than a complaint-led inquiry) -- which Beuc says risks a further delay to reaching a decision on the complaints themselves. It further points out that the DPC's probe of Google only looks at activity since February 2020 not November 2018 when the complaints were made -- meaning there's a missing chunk of Google's location data processing that's not even being investigated yet. The report also points out the inherent imbalance of GDPR's one-stop-shop mechanism shifting the administration of complaints to the location of companies under investigation -- arguing they therefore benefit from \"easier access to justice\" (versus the ordinary consumer faced with undertaking legal proceedings in a different country and (likely) language). \"If the lead authority is in a country with tradition in \u2018common law,\u2019 like Ireland, things can become even more complex and costly,\" Beuc's report further notes. Another issue it raises is the overarching one of rights complaints having to fight what it dubs \"a moving target\" -- given well-resourced tech companies can leverage regulatory delays to (superficially) tweak practices, greasing continued abuse with misleading PR campaigns. (Something Beuc accuses Google of doing.) DPAs must \"adapt their enforcement approach to intervene more rapidly and directly.\" it concludes. \"Over two years have passed since the GDPR became applicable, we have now reached a turning point. The GDPR must finally show its strength and become a catalyst for urgently needed changes in business practices,\" Beuc goes on in a summary of its recommendations. \"Our members experience and that of other civil society organisations, reveals a series of obstacles that significantly hamper the effective application of the GDPR and the correct functioning of its enforcement system. We reached out to the Commission and the Irish DPC with questions about the report. But at the time of writing neither had responded. We've also asked Google for comment. Update: The DPC's deputy commissioner, Graham Doyle, told us the reason it chose to open a \"forward-looking\" inquiry into Google's location practices in early 2020 was it wanted to be able to investigate \"in real time\" rather than try to go back and replicate how things were. Doyle also said the location-related Google complaints had been lodged with different DPAs at difference times -- meaning some complaints had taken considerably longer to reach Ireland than November 2018, raising questions about the efficiency of the current procedures for European DPAs to send complaints to a lead supervisor. \"The complaints in question were lodged with different Supervisory Authorities on different dates from November 2018,\" he said. \"The DPC received these complaints in July 2019, following which we engaged with Beuc. We then opened an own-volition inquiry in February 2020 in a manner that will enable us to undertake real-time testing in order to evidence our findings.\" It also said that it would \"continue to use all the tools at its disposal to foster compliance by member states with their obligations\" -- including, potentially, instigating infringement procedures if necessary. Additional follow-up actions related to \"implementing and complementing\" the legal framework that it detailed in the report included supporting \"further exchanges of views and national practices between member states on topics that are subject to further specification at national level so as to reduce the level of fragmentation of the single market, such as processing of personal data relating to health and research, or which are subject to balancing with other rights such as the freedom of expression;\" and to push for \"a consistent application of the data protection framework in relation to new technologies to support innovation and technological developments.\"  The commission also said it would use the GDPR Member States Expert Group to \"facilitate discussions and sharing of experience between member states and with the commission,\" with a view to improving the regulation's operation. In the area of GDPR's governance system, EU lawmakers committed to continue to monitor the effectiveness and independence of national DPAs, and said they would work to encourage cooperation between regulators (\"in particular in fields such as competition, electronic communications, security of network and information systems and consumer policy\"), while also supporting the EDPB to assess how procedures related to cross-border cases could be improved."

    "article_text":"Technology has reached a point where it is leaving no stone in the global economy unturned, and this has become increasingly apparent in healthcare. More specifically, a confluence of mobility and high-speed internet access, cloud computing, and analytics have made remote care via phone or teleconference a reality -- and it turns out a pandemic is all that was needed to spur mass adoption. Image source: Getty Images. In 2015, a very small company named Teladoc pioneering a novel means of delivering care via the internet made its public debut. Fast forward a few years, and Teladoc is quickly becoming a well-known name in the medical sphere. But with a market cap of $28 billion in a global industry that accounts for trillions of dollars in spending every year, Teladoc is still in the very early chapters of its growth story. \u00a0 In short, while the pandemic might be inflating the growth figures for Teladoc this year, virtual care has real benefits for patients. It increases patient access to primary care and specialty medical professionals, adds convenience to the equation (fewer trips to the doctor and less waiting around), and in turn, saves on cost. There is a long runway of growth ahead of this tiny industry. The potential for further shake-up of the global healthcare landscape is massive, and this is still a small-ish company that has the early lead in the race. I think I'll remain a buyer for the long term. Much like Teladoc, Amwell is also getting a boost in activity on its platform due to the pandemic. During the third quarter, total visits exploded to 1.41 million, compared to just 255,000 a year ago. Total revenue also increased 80% to $62.6 million. With respectable expansion during its first quarter as a public concern, why have shares pulled back? \u00a0 For one thing, Amwell is smaller than Teladoc, so expectations may have been set that its growth trajectory would outpace that of its larger peer. It's also worth noting that Amwell still operates at a loss. Free cash flow (revenue minus cash operating and capital expenses) was negative $94.1 million through the first nine months of 2020. Gross profit margin also fell to 32.7% for Amwell during the last quarter (down from 45.1% last year) because of lower-margin patient visits related to the pandemic. For the sake of comparison, Teladoc's gross margin was 62.7% over the last 12-month stretch.\u00a0 "

    "article_text":"Still, many on Wall Street see roughly 20% upside on the S&P 500 in just the next year. The thesis of that is built on two broader themes: Vaccines creating near-term earnings momentum and low interest rates keeping valuations elevated. Getting to that earnings number requires that a few things unfold cleanly. The bank expects more than 1.26 billion doses of vaccine to be distributed worldwide by the first quarter of 2021, with more on the way through the year. That should allow for a meaningful portion of the U.S. population to be immunized, which would be a catalyst for aggressive state reopenings, a major positive for hiring and consumer spending. Also, Goldman recently lifted 2021 and 2022 earnings per share estimates, by 12% for 2022, as companies across sectors beat third-quarter estimates handily. Companies posted a year-over-year EPS decline of 6%, against initial estates of a 21% decline. Goldman expects gross domestic product growth of 3.8% in 2022, compared with consensus estimates of 2.8%, allowing for 17% EPS growth over 2021. Most expect strong growth in 2021 against an easy 2020 comparison, but \u201cGoldman Sachs Economics U.S. GDP growth forecasts reflect a continued \u201cV-shaped\u201d recovery,\u201d chief U.S. equity strategist David Kostin wrote in a note.  Every weekday evening we highlight the consequential market news of the day and explain what's likely to matter tomorrow.  Goldman\u2019s multiple on 2022 earnings is a bit elevated, but the firm expects the 10-year Treasury yield to rise only to 1.3% by next year from 0.87% currently. Lower rates increase the attractiveness of stocks, supporting valuation. The Fed\u2019s purchase of tens of billions of dollars of treasuries per week is acting against the economic growth that can lift rates. Goldman\u2019s estimates reflect an equity risk premium\u2014the extra return investors demand for the risky stocks over the safe 10-year treasury bond\u2014of 3.2%. That is below the current 3.6% premium, but Goldman said investors will be less risk-averse as political uncertainty eases. JPMorgan Chase strategists have a 4500 year-end 2021 price target, representing 24% upside. One key factor JPMorgan has in common with Goldman: \u201cExpectations of many key risks subsiding (e.g. U.S. elections, pandemic and vaccine news, etc.) clearing the path to a more positive forward outlook,\u201d Dubravko Lakos, JPMorgan\u2019s chief U.S. equity strategist, wrote in a note.

But even amid this chaos, we can be thankful that there's light at the end of the tunnel. Recent interim analyses in late-stage studies from Pfizer\/BioNTech\u00a0and Moderna showed respective vaccine effectiveness of 95% and 94.5%. While COVID-19 isn't going to disappear overnight, there looks to be a real solution on the horizon. Even when things are at their grimmest, there's always something to be thankful for -- and that, too, goes for investors.

    "article_text":"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Hopes that vaccines will soon replace economic lockdowns as our best defense against the coronavirus have stirred speculation that value stocks will regain favor among investors. A guy who until recently oversaw $1.6 trillion has a strong argument that growth stocks will continue to be a better investment. Hiro Mizuno was chief investment officer of Japan\u2019s Government Pension Investment Fund for five years until the end of March. Now a Tesla Inc. board member and special adviser to Japan\u2019s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, here\u2019s what he tweeted at the weekend: Pitting the disruptive vision of entrepreneurs against the hopes of uncovering a real find amid the clutter of beaten down stocks provides a compelling way to frame the debate about whether growth stocks, classified as shares of companies with accelerating revenues, can keep outpacing value stocks, equities whose value is deemed not to reflect some measure of underlying worth. It seemed like the equation might be changing. Value stocks enjoyed a renaissance this month when vaccine euphoria prompted investors to rotate into shares trashed as the pandemic crimped the global economy. Their returns beat their growth counterparts by five percentage points in the first three weeks of November. That\u2019s sparked talk of a global revival. On Tuesday, Bank of America Corp. strategist Savita Subramanian recommended U.S. financial and energy stocks as her top two \u201cunapologetically cyclical and value-focused\u201d sectors. Strategists at Barclays Plc, led by Emmanuel Cau, on Wednesday recommended investors in European shares should overweight value versus growth. And John Woods, Credit Suisse Group AG\u2019s Asia Pacific CIO, said Asian value stocks will outperform in the next six months provided a vaccine becomes widely available. So could it finally be value stocks\u2019 turn in the sun? Investment advisers who\u2019ve called for a reversal of that trend have been proven wrong time and again. In the chart above, the biggest stocks in the Bloomberg Value Index include investment bank JPMorgan Chase & Co., telecoms operator AT&T Inc. and energy company Exxon Mobil Corp. The growth index is dominated by the FAANGS: Facebook Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Apple Inc., Netflix Inc. and Google\u2019s parent, Alphabet Inc. The picture doesn\u2019t change no matter the time period. So far this year, growth stocks have gained about 24%, while value stocks are down by 5%. In the past 12 months, growth is up by 28%, value down by 2.5%. Over three years, growth delivers 66% versus just 12% for value. And since early 2007, when the index histories begin, growth is up more than fourfold while value has a bit more than doubled in value. But hope for value stocks seems to spring eternal. A net 24% of investors overseeing $526 billion expect value to outperform growth the coming year, according to Bank of America\u2019s November survey. That\u2019s the most bullish call for value in the monthly poll since February 2019. Mizuno says that investment style fails to capture disruptors that sacrifice earnings early on to build a dominant market share. Jeff Bezos\u2019s Amazon is probably the best example of that kind of company. \u201cGrowth investing for me is to bet on the ability of CEO and his\/her staff to deliver more than people (including myself) can imagine,\u201d Mizuno also tweeted. By contrast, trying to identify value stocks takes a cocky \u2014 and risky \u2014 self-assurance that the wisdom of the investing crowd has missed something fundamental about a company\u2019s worth. If a share is cheap, it\u2019s probably cheap for a reason. You could even stretch the argument to cover the recent enthusiasm for Bitcoin versus gold. As my colleague Lionel Laurent recently pointed out, the digital currency barely figures in buying and selling in the real world and yet its gains have rapidly outpaced the yellow metal this year.Gold has real-world applications that make it inherently valuable, but many investors still view it as nothing more than a pet rock, limiting the potential universe of buyers. To its fans, Bitcoin represents a transformative technology with the potential to dislodge fiat currencies as a means of payment. In effect, it\u2019s a bet on the future of finance with a side wager that its momentum will continue apace \u2014 like a disruptive growth stock. The current enthusiasm for value stocks may well have further scope to run. But in the longer term, the trend that\u2019s been your friend seems likely to persist. Even once the pandemic is over, backing entrepreneurs will prove more profitable than buying allegedly undervalued equities in the hope that mean reversion will rescue them from the bargain basement.

    "article_text":"Corporates\u2019 relationship with renewable energy might not be as straightforward. For many companies, the cost of climate change, not\u00a0a change of heart, could be what has been forcing them to restrategize and reduce carbon footprints or think about reducing fossil fuel consumption. Nevertheless, corporate organizations have emerged among the biggest buyers of renewable energy. When it comes to which corners of the corporate world have been buying the most renewable energy, well, there are no surprises here as Big Tech easily takes the cake.\u00a0 However, the big surprise is that Big Oil, a sector that is frequently castigated for its outsized role in climate change, is beginning to make its presence felt here in a big way, too. Source: BNEF Big Oil to rival Big Tech\u00a0 Over the past half-decade or so, tech giants Google, Amazon, Facebook, and Microsoft have been dominating clean energy procurement and are looking to continue being renewable energy\u2019s biggest customers. These four internet giants operate massive, power-hungry data centers that have been blamed for their copious greenhouse gas emissions. It\u2019s, therefore, probably not surprising that they are putting some effort into ameliorating at least some of the damage. Big Tech might be the clear leader in the renewable energy space, but Big Oil might soon rival it. Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY), Chevron (NYSE:CVX) and Energy Transfer Partners (NYSE:ET) all signed solar contracts in 2019, following in the steps of ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM), which signed several large PPAs in 2018. Robust clean energy demand BNEF says that sustainability commitments as well as the powerful ESG megatrend will ensure that clean energy procurement from corporations continues to thrive. In fact, the energy watchdog estimates that last year\u2019s 221 RE100 companies will need to purchase an additional 210TWh of clean electricity in 2030 to meet their targets, which in turn will catalyze an estimated 105GW of new solar and wind build globally and nearly $100B in clean energy infrastructure. Source: BNEF But with RE100 membership expanding at such an impressive clip, you can bet the actual clean energy and infrastructure figures are bound to be 2-3x higher than BNEF estimates.

    "article_text":"(Bloomberg) -- Amazon.com Inc.\u2019s cloud-computing division suffered an outage on Wednesday that affected several customers, including Roku Inc. and Adobe Inc. Amazon Web Services\u2019s status page noted that its Kinesis data streaming service was \u201ccurrently impaired\u201d in the company\u2019s U.S. East 1 region. The outages were also making it harder to post updates to a closely watched status page, the company said. The failure affected the ability of customers to use roughly two dozen services, hitting streaming hardware maker Roku, software seller Adobe and digital photo service Flickr. \u201cKinesis has been experiencing increased error rates this morning in our US-East-1 Region that\u2019s impacted some other AWS services,\u201d a company spokeswoman said in an emailed statement. \u201cWe are working toward resolution.\u201d AWS is the largest provider of rented computing power and software services, and its data centers serve as the invisible foundation of much of the internet. That gives failures in its services an immediate visibility that rivals like Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google sometimes don\u2019t face. AWS is a collection of more than 175 software services, from data storage to a range of databases and machine-learning software. Customers often use more than one, linking them together in ways that can cause a failure in one system to cascade across multiple programs. The Seattle-based company operates those services from 24 regions, or clusters of data centers, geographic redundancy designed to station computing power close to customers while limiting the chance that a failure in any single region will result in permanent loss of data. U.S. East-1, which relies on data centers clustered in northern Virginia, is among AWS\u2019s most important regions, analysts say. Kinesis Data Streams, the service at the root of Wednesday\u2019s outage, captures and performs analytics on data, including social media feeds, dumps of public records and internal application usage logs, which can be then be fed into a variety of other software programs. Jaspreet Singh, chief executive officer of Druva Inc., a data backup and disaster recovery software maker that uses AWS services, said his engineers first noticed the outage early Wednesday morning when the flow of notifications from an AWS data monitoring service were disrupted. While the outage didn\u2019t completely sever access to a critical AWS service, it seemed to touch more products than previous outages, Singh said. \u201cTypically what tends to happen is one service goes down\u201d for a half hour or so, he said. \u201cThis is a different kind of issue. It\u2019s bigger. Things are failing internally.\u201d (Updates with detail on AWS and quote from AWS customer, beginning in the sixth paragraph.) \u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P."

    "article_text":"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Soccer fans are fortunate to live in a time when two superstars are simultaneously making the claim to be the best player in the history of the sport \u2014 and more fortunate still that we can watch the contest between Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo play out, week in and week out, live before a global audience of billions. Thanks to YouTube, I can watch high-quality videos of their most compelling performances, and of every goal they\u2019ve ever scored. When Diego Maradona was staking his claim to the title of best ever, most of the world could only get a quadrennial glimpse of his genius, when he turned out for Argentina in the \u201982, \u201986, \u201990 and \u201894 World Cups. Growing up in India during that period, I never saw highlights of his performances for FC Barcelona or Napoli (a city where he\u2019s still regarded as part deity, part royalty). Obituary: Maradona, Soccer Icon Who Led Argentina to Glory, Dies at 60 There are now some video highlights online that preserve a grainy record of him in his pomp \u2014 including THAT goal against England in the Azteca Stadium on June 22, 1986. But these only hint at what he was capable of. They don\u2019t constitute sufficient supporting evidence to the argument that he was the best ever. What makes it harder still is the even scarcer evidence for claimants of previous generations: Hungary\u2019s Ferenc Puskas, Spain and Argentina\u2019s Alfredo di Stefano, Brazil\u2019s Pele, the Dutchman Johan Cruyff, Germany\u2019s Franz Beckenbauer, et al. That they played under different conditions and rules, and in different positions, makes the argument moot, anyway. We can\u2019t, then, know if Maradona was technically the best to have kicked a ball. Nevertheless, I\u2019m here to argue that he was the greatest of all time. And my case rests on the simple fact that he, more than all the other claimants named here, came closest to defying the dictum that soccer is a team sport. For most of his career, Maradona played in teams that lacked any other world-beating players. Run your eye down the list of the Napoli squad with which he conquered Italian soccer in 1986-87, and there\u2019s not a single other player who would make it to a Serie A hall of fame. He had a slightly better supporting cast in the Argentina sides that he took to two World Cup finals \u2014 winning it in \u201986, and coming agonizingly close in \u201990 \u2014 but nobody would argue that Jorge Valdano was to Maradona what, say, Jairzinho was to Pele in \u201970. It is one thing to be a brilliant player surrounded by other brilliant players; in this regard Messi and Ronaldo have been exceptionally fortunate with their club teams. But Maradona made magic out of mediocre materials. What makes this even more remarkable is the weight of expectation he carried on his diminutive frame. When he signed for Napoli in 1984, the club had never won the Italian league, and yet its fans immediately began to dream of championship glory. The \u201cpibe de oro,\u201d or golden boy, was as much talisman as captain and player. Other footballers \u2014 Messi among them \u2014 have since had to cope with comparable pressure, but modern superstars are surrounded by a scaffolding of public relations professionals and psychiatrists to help them. Maradona, lacking support off the field as he did on it, nonetheless delivered the \u201coro\u201d for club and country over and over again. Until he didn\u2019t. It was probably inevitable that the burdens of his genius would eventually crush him, and they did so in spectacular fashion. But he withstood them long enough to cast in bronze \u2014 like the plaque commemorating THAT goal outside the Azteca Stadium \u2014 his claim to being the greatest of all time. RIP, Diego Armando Maradona, GOAT. (Corrects name of player on Pele\u2019s 1970 team in seventh paragraph.)

    "article_text":"Inventions to help the blind \u201csee\u201d have quietly been spurring innovation for decades. Often, idealistic inventors create with a charitable mindset \u2013 to help the needy or return something lost \u2013 but the real technological advances in sight tech have done a lot more than simply suggest a cure for human disability. They\u2019ve created new abilities for everyone, and opened new doors to unpredictable innovation: The 12-inch record, the computer keyboard, and the text recognition software that laid the foundation for the modern database were all brought to market, initially, for blind consumers. There was a time when a personal assistant, someone to read to you or a car at your door, were once thought of as \u201cspecial\u201d \u2013 but no longer. Today, every device shipped by Apple, Amazon, Google and Microsoft includes these capabilities and more, not as a bonus but as a necessity to compete in today\u2019s competitive hardware and software markets. So whether you use your phone in dark mode or talk to Siri while you\u2019re driving, you too use \u201csight tech\u201d that was invented initially for the visually impaired. Over and over again, designing for blind consumers has shown an ROI far beyond helping the needy. Audiobooks, which were heavily resisted by publishers when first developed for blind readers in 1934, now are the book industry\u2019s only growing business. Likewise, coding your website for a blind person\u2019s screen reader might seem like extra work until you realize it optimizes your SEO and makes your website more usable to about a billion other non-standard device users, as well. The world of sight tech is absolutely full of these types of happy surprises; unexpected synchronicities and wide applicability that started with designing for a seemingly small group. For most, the self-driving car is a long-promised luxury. For those of us who can\u2019t get a driver\u2019s license, it\u2019s the key to an unprecedented level of independence. Researchers at Waymo are intent on making sure that, when the first self-driving taxi arrives on your doorstep, it shouldn\u2019t matter whether you can see or not: You should be able to hop in and take a ride. Similarly, maps are much more than just a handy tool for those of us with visual impairments. In many cases, they\u2019re the only option for finding your bearings \u2013 the difference between independence and codependence. Blind and sighted inventors alike have been pushing for better, more exact navigational tools for decades, and today the team at GOOD Maps has harnessed the power of lidar, data and and faster-than-ever processors to make sure that someone with no sight can get themselves within arm's reach of exactly what they\u2019re looking for. Join product managers from Waymo, Waymap, Goodmaps and more to hear about the future of getting from point A to point B. Since the late 1980s, companies like Freedom Scientific and Humanware have laid the foundation for accessible computing, writing software and building devices that can convert visual information into sound or touch. Those devices were operating computers, rendering digital Braille and delivering audio books to readers long before there was an app for that. Today, mainstream tech giants Apple, Amazon, Microsoft and Google are creating screen readers and assistive devices of their own, not to mention the thousands of third-party apps for navigation, sensory optimization, recognizing text and images and more. And with this new functionality native to operating systems, established assistive tech companies are evolving, too. We\u2019ll take a deep dive into what\u2019s next for the \u201cscreen reader\u201d \u2013 and how new tech from AI to AR, and headgear to haptics are shaking up interfaces and reshaping paradigms across our industry. Over the course of two days, we\u2019ll be hearing from the accessibility leaders at Apple, Microsoft, Google, Vispero, Humanware, Amazon and more. Even the greatest new tech creates great new problems. And as AI swoops in to save the day, allowing blind and visually impaired people to overcome barriers in their work and social lives, AI can also introduce new biases that we never expected. When training our systems to recognize, categorize and interact with real people, how do we account for disability and a diverse range of functional needs? How do we make machines that don\u2019t inherit our own cultural prejudices? We\u2019ll also be joined by some of the blindness and disability community\u2019s greatest advocates: people like Lainey Feingold, Haben Girma and George Kerscher, who will take a hard look at access to information as a civil right, how far we\u2019ve come and how far we have to go in the era of AI. \u00a0 \u00a0"

And clearly the pandemic has reinforced the businesses that we have on the consumer side and help us in that direction,\u201d Lores told Yahoo Finance Live in the wake of a 10 cent fourth fiscal quarter earnings beat Tuesday evening. \u201cAt the same time, we continue to make progress executing all of our strategies, whether it is to advance the leadership that we have in PCs and print to create new categories, but also to transform the company and become more efficient,\u201d said Lores. \u201cSo we will look at the impact that all of those things are having as what is behind the success and the progress we are making, as reflected in our results.\u201d Here are HP\u2019s fourth fiscal quarter results, compared to Bloomberg estimates: Total Revenue: $15.3 billion (sales fell 1% from same time a year ago) vs. $14.69 billion Non-GAAP EPS: 62 cents vs. 52 cents First Fiscal Quarter EPS Guidance: 64 cents a share to 70 cents vs. 54 cents Sales at HP\u2019s personal systems and printing segments were unchanged and fell 3%, respectively, from the prior year. Sales growth was notched inside the consumer segments of each division, reflecting consumers buying notebook computers and printers to work from home. Commercial sales dropped as workers have migrated from offices where large printers and desktops reign supreme \u2014 hence less desire by businesses to buy new hardware. Operating profits at HP\u2019s personal systems segment fell slightly on a sequential basis, but rose 260 basis points at the printer business. Lores told Yahoo Finance the printer business bottomed in the third fiscal quarter. The Street very often has a lot to weigh on HP. The company isn\u2019t exactly a high growth tech juggernaut like any one of the FAANG stocks. But, Lores continues to gain high marks on the Street for his management of the business during the pandemic \u2014 which includes a very watchful eye on expenses and a push to innovate in both the printer and computing sides of the businesses. HP has frankly just done good amidst the pandemic to build goodwill among households, moving quickly to support the computing needs of students. And now with expense tailwinds at his back supporting margins, Lores looks ready to become even more aggressive on the cash deployment front to drive a higher stock price. \u201cIf I look at what we did in the third quarter and fourth quarter combined, we bought back close to 10% of the outstanding shares of the company. I would say this is a fairly remarkable number,\u201d Lores told Yahoo Finance. \u201cAnd we have also announced that going forward, we are going to buy at least $1 billion of shares per quarter. And we also have announced that we are going to be increasing our dividend by 10% in 2021. So we remain fully committed to returning capital to shareholders. We have done that during the last two quarters, and we will continue to do that in the coming quarters.\u201d Again, not a bad position to be in for Lores and his shareholders.

The gaming platform for individual creators has a long runway for growth and looks similar to YouTube a decade ago. Here's what investors need to know about the company. Image source: Getty Images. Roblox has a similar strategy, except with gaming instead of video. It describes itself as a \"global platform where millions of people gather together every day to imagine, create, and share experiences with each other in immersive, user-generated 3D worlds.\" In layman's terms, Roblox users build games that other Roblox users can play. The company makes money by selling its virtual currency called \"Robux\" to users. Users can then spend Robux on experiences and features built by the developer community, which then can be exchanged for real-world currency. It also offers Roblox Premium, a subscription service where users can get Robux at a discount to the company's internal exchange rate.  Through the first nine months of 2020, Roblox posted $589 million in sales and a $206 million net loss. However, that loss is a bit misleading. Net bookings, defined as sales before any non-cash adjustments, were $1.24 billion in the same period, up 171% from 2019. Why such a large discrepancy between bookings and sales? Because when Roblox sells users Robux, it can't recognize that as revenue until the users spend those Robux on something. This makes it seem like the company is losing a ton of money, when in fact it has generated $292.6 million in free cash flow so far this year.  Roblox is currently focused on building a platform for kids. Some 54% of its 31.1 million daily active users (DAUs) over the last nine months were under the age of 13. This may concern investors, because young kids are usually not high-paying users. However, Roblox's 17-24 age group, while only 16% of overall users, is growing faster than its core under-13 demographic. Eventually, Roblox wants to enable content development for older age groups, stating in its S-1 that it is working to host experiences for gamers of all types.  Another concern among investors is that Roblox is getting a temporary \"COVID bump\" that is not indicative of its long-term growth. While it is true the pandemic accelerated bookings growth to 171% in 2020, the company was still growing at a healthy 39% rate in 2019. Even if growth reverts back to mid-double-digits in 2021 or 2022, that seems like nothing any potential shareholder would need to worry about.  Investors should expect bookings growth to remain strong, given the size and growth of the overall gaming industry. Estimates peg the market size at around $150 billion and on pace to grow around 12%-13% over the next decade. Given this long runway and the fact Roblox is already cash-flow positive, investors should keep a keen eye on this company as it nears the public markets."

    "article_text":"In this episode of Influencers, Andy Serwer speaks with former NFL player and 'Uncomfortable Conversations with a Black Man' author, Emmanuel Acho, about Colin Kaepernick's future in football and what NFL owners can do to address racial tension within the league. ANDY SERWER: When you had Roger Goodell on, Emmanuel-- I think it was in August-- he offered an apology to Colin Kaepernick. But Colin Kaepernick still has not been signed by a team. Is this collusion? Do you think he'll ever go back to the NFL? EMMANUEL ACHO: No, I don't think Colin Kaepernick will play in the NFL, but there are so many variables to this. What do I mean by that? In the NFL, every organization runs a cost-benefit analysis. How much will it cost us to have you on organization, and how much will you benefit us? So if you're an NFL organization, especially four years removed, in regards to Colin Kaepernick, now you're weighing the risk-reward. He'll come in, and obviously, he'll be anywhere from a second- to a third-string quarterback right now. Is having Colin Kaepernick as a second- or third-string quarterback worth the questions that every player will now get asked, that we will now get asked, and is it worth the distraction that the media will create? Not Colin Kaepernick, necessarily, but the media will create. So, because of that, I don't think that Colin Kaepernick would get signed. I also think that-- I don't know-- sometimes there's an impasse. Remember. Let's talk Cam Newton for a second. Cam Newton didn't want to be a backup quarterback. He wanted to be a starter. And as a result, there was only one team that wanted to make him a starter. Eric Reid, someone who has been proudly known to be standing by Colin Kaepernick, very justifiably so-- the Washington Football Team-- they offered him a place on their practice squad. Eric Reid turned it down because Eric Reid views himself as a starter. And so, just because you want to play doesn't necessarily mean that the position will be offered to you that you do, in fact, want. So, because of all the nuances regarding that, I personally don't see Colin Kaepernick playing in the NFL. - So it was the situation where the owners didn't want him for a while, and now Father Time has entered into the equation as well a little bit, perhaps, too. EMMANUEL ACHO: I would say it's a combination of everything. The owners don't want what the media will bring with that, number one. And number two-- it's so detailed, and it's so multifaceted, but until the owners can also get their fans to understand it wasn't about disrespecting the flag-- it was about a just cause-- then the owners, who were always worried about bottom line, who were always worried about their dollars, now are gonna run the risk of losing their dollars for the sake of Colin Kaepernick. And unfortunately, owners just aren't that selfless. You don't become a billionaire by being selfless. That's not how it works. - And as you were saying, too, Emmanuel-- different cities, different owners, different politics. It's all part of that equation, as you said. You mentioned the 32 owners. Only two of them are people of color, and only three non-interim head coaches are black. Wow. Seems like there's a long way to go there, too, right? EMMANUEL ACHO: Yeah, but the issue, Andy, is that so many people think the NFL is a meritocracy. However hard you work, you'll earn your success. It's not. It's really based off nepotism and cronyism. Nepotism, you hire your family, and cronyism, you hire your friends. Historically, if the NFL was founded by white men, white men are hiring their family-- nepotism-- white men. They're hiring their friends-- cronyism-- white men. So how do you think that the NFL will change if it's historically founded by white men who are looking out for other white men? It won't. And so, that's why it's not a coincidence when you see only 3 out of 32 coaches, full-time, who began the season, or whatever the statistic may be, are black. That's not a coincidence. That's just the way in which our world at large works, and the NFL is a reflection of that."
