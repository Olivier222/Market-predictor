Implement AI for predicting stock market / turning a profit on auto.

Investors look at many factors that influence markets in order to decide to invest/trade/buy/hold/sell an asset.

Factors can include (but no limited to):

1) financial statements
2) financial news
3) psychology of the masses regarding the company
4) competition
5) stock price and history
6) macro economic factors (i.e: trade agreements, subsidies, local,national and foreign governments policies)

Most of these require knowledge in the field which is acquired by many hours of reading and digesting public information.

The state-of-the-art NLP model (Google: GPT-3) is now able to generate text which looks generated by a human. This means that it is also able to "digest" or interpret text information.

Perhaps an AI system to predict the stock market / inform trade decisions could be developed. 
Such a system could comprise of multiple models (1 for each factors?) which evaluates the various factors that influence investor decisions. 

An intial draft of such a model could be as follows:

1) vectorization of financial statements
2) sentiment analysis of financial news
3) sentiment analysis of social media content related to the stock
4) vectorization of stock price history
5) combine outputs (or hidden states?) of above models into input for final model to predict price (or buy and sell dates?)

GPT-3 is a Transformer model. A Transformer model would likely be the first choice for text analysis and stock price prediction as it is the state-of-the-art sequence-sequence models
